 PICARD V.O. / Captain's log, stardate 42353.7. Our destination is planet Cygnus IV, beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy.
 PICARD V.O. / My orders are to examine Farpoint, a starbase built there by the inhabitants of that world. Meanwhile ...
 PICARD V.O. / (continuing) ... I am becoming better acquainted with my new command, this Galaxy Class U.S.S. Enterprise.
 PICARD V.O. / I am still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity.
 PICARD V.O. / (continuing) ... my crew we are short in several key positions, most notably ...
 PICARD, TROI, and DATA seated in the command area. / Starfleet LIEUTENANT WORF, a young Klingon, is at the "Ops" station and a SUPERNUMERARY is at "Conn".
 PICARD V.O. / (continuing) ... a first officer, but I am informed that a highly experienced man, one Commander William Riker, will be waiting to join our ship when we reach our Cygnus IV destination.
 PICARD / You will agree, Data, that Starfleet's instructions are difficult?
 DATA / Difficult ... how so? Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station.
 PICARD / (smiles) As simple as that.
 TROI / Farpoint Station. Even the name sounds mysterious.
 PICARD / The problem, Data, is that another life form built that base. How do I negotiate a friendly agreement for Starfleet to use it while at the same time snoop around finding how and why they built it?
 DATA / Inquiry ... the word snoop ... ?
 PICARD / Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop?
 DATA / Possibility ... a kind of human behavior I was not designed to emulate?
 PICARD / It means 'to spy, to sneak' ...
 DATA / (interrupting; delighted) Ah! To seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither ...
 PICARD / (wanting to cut it off) Exactly, yes ...
 DATA / ... to glide, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gumshoe ...
 TROI / Captain ... I'm sensing a ... a powerful mind ...
 WORF / Something strange on the detector circuits ...
 DATA / It registers as solid, Captain...
 TROI / Or an incredibly powerful forcefield. But if we collide with either ...
 PICARD / (to Conn) Go to Condition Yellow. And shut off that damned noise.
 WORF / Shields and deflectors, up, sir.
 PICARD / Reverse power, full stop.
 CONN / Controls to full stop, sir.
 CONN / Now reading full stop, sir.
 "Q" (ELIZABETHAN) / You are notified that your kind has infiltrated the galaxy too far already. You are directed to return to your own solar system immediately.
 PICARD / That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you are?
 "Q" (ELIZABETHAN) / We call ourselves "the Q". Or you may call me that; it's all much the same thing. (indicating costume) And I have presented myself to you as a fellow ship captain so that you will better understand me. (indicates) Go back from where you...
 "Q" (ELIZABETHAN) / Stay where you are!
 PICARD / Data, call medics!
 TROI / He's frozen. Can you feel the cold?
 PICARD / He would not have injured you! (indicates phaser) Do you understand this; the stun setting?
 "Q" (ELIZABETHAN) / Knowing humans as you do, Captain, would you want to be captured helpless by them? (moves closer) Now, go back or you will certainly die!
 PICARD / Is he still alive?
 MEDIC / For now. We'll do our best, sir.
 "Q" (ELIZABETHAN) / Your little centuries go by so rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you'll understand this better.
 "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) / Actually, the issue at stake is patriotism. You must return to your world and put an end to the communists. All it takes is a few good men.
 PICARD / What? That nonsense is centuries behind us!
 "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) / But you can't deny Captain, that you're still a dangerous, savage child-race.
 PICARD / Most certainly I deny it. I agree that we still were when ... (indicating) ... humans wore costumes like that four hundred years ago...
 "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) / At which time you slaughtered millions in silly arguments about how to divide the resources of your little world. And four hundred years before that you were murdering each other in quarrels over tribal god-images. And since there have been no indications that humans will ever change .....
 PICARD / But even as far back as... ! (indicates) ... that costume, we had begun to make rapid progress.
 "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) / Oh? Shall we review your "rapid progress"?
 "Q" (21ST CENTURY) / (interrupting) Rapid progress to where humans learned to control their military with drugs.
 WORF / Sir, sickbay reports that Lieutenant Graham's condition is better.
 "Q" (21ST CENTURY) / Concern for one's comrade. How touching.
 WORF / (indicates "Q") And now, sir, a personal request. Permission to clean up the bridge?
 TASHA / Lieutenant Worf is right, sir. As Security Chief I can't just stand here and ....
 PICARD / Yes, you can, Tasha.
 "Q" (21ST CENTURY) / Ah, yes... better! (deep breath, feeling it) Then later, on finally reaching deep space, humans of course found enemies to fight out there too. And to broaden those struggles.... (indicating Worf and Tasha) .... you again found allies to permit still more murdering and all over again the same old story.
 PICARD / (interrupting; angry) No! The most dangerous 'same old story' is the one we're meeting now! Those who go on misinformation, half-information, self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute, to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate.
 "Q" (21ST CENTURY) / What an interesting idea. Prosecute and judge?
 "Q" (21ST CENTURY) / (continuing) And suppose it turns out we understand you humans only too well?
 PICARD / We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal.
 "Q" (21ST CENTURY) / The facts about you? Splendid, splendid! You are a veritable fountain of good ideas. (smiling; pleasant) There are preparations to make, Captain, but when I return...
 "Q" gives a 21st Century salute to Picard. / 
 "Q" (21ST CENTURY) / (continuing) ... we will proceed exactly as you suggest!
 WORF / Sir... respectfully submit our only choice is to fight. If we Klingons understand anything, it is the meaning of that kind of talk.
 TASHA / My sentiments too, sir. Fight or try to escape.
 PICARD / Sense anything, Commander?
 TROI / (shakes head) Its mind is much too powerful, sir. And frightening. Concur we avoid further contact if possible!
 PICARD / From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for any reason will make use of signals, transmission or intercom. (crossing quickly to Ops and Conn) We'll try to take them by surprise. (to Worf) Inform engineering to make ready for maximum acceleration. We'll find out what this Galaxy Class can do.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Records search, Data. Results of detaching the Saucer Section at high warp speeds.
 DATA / Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir.
 PICARD / Search theoretical.
 DATA / (thinking; then) It is possible, sir. But absolutely no error margin.
 PICARD / Attention bridge crew!
 PICARD / (continuing) Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration. Maximum, you're entitled to know, means we'll be pushing our engines well past safety limits. Our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there, try to outrun it. (looks around, then) Our only other option would be to put tail between our legs and return to Earth as they demand.
 WORF / Engine room ready, sir.
 TROI / The board shows 'green', Captain. All go!
 PICARD / Stand by... (takes his seat, checks bridge, then) ENGAGE!
 WORF / Velocity warp nine point two.
 DATA / Heading, 351 Mark 11, sir.
 PICARD / Steady on that.
 TASHA / The hostile is now giving chase, sir. Accelerating fast.
 WORF / We're now at Warp nine point three, sir. Which takes us past the red line, sir.
 PICARD / Continue accelerating. (to Troi) Counselor, at this point I'm open even to guesses about what we've just met.
 TROI / (considers, then) It... it felt like something beyond what we'd consider a 'life form'.
 PICARD / 'Beyond'?
 TROI / Very, very advanced, sir. Or... (considers) Or certainly, very, very different!
 WORF / (with emphasis now) Sir, we're at warp nine point four.
 TASHA / Hostile is now beginning to overtake us, sir.
 PICARD / Are you sure?
 DATA / Hostile's velocity is already warp nine point six, sir. Shall I put them on main viewer?
 PICARD / (nods) Reverse angle on viewer.
 DATA / Magnifying viewer image.
 TASHA / Hostile's velocity now at nine point seven, sir.
 PICARD / Ops, inform Engineering we need more!
 DATA / Engine room attempting to comply, sir. But they caution us...
 PICARD / (interrupting; to Data) Go to yellow alert!
 PICARD / (to Tasha) Arm photon torpedoes, Weapons Station. Place them on ready status.
 TASHA / Torpedoes to ready, sir.
 WORF / That was a design tremor, sir. A warning.
 TASHA / Hostile now at warp nine point eight, sir.
 WORF / Our velocity is only nine point five, sir.
 DATA / Projection, sir. We may be able to match the hostile's nine point eight, sir. But at extreme risk.
 TASHA / Now reading the hostile at warp nine point nine, sir.
 PICARD / Attention bridge. Print-out message, urgent, to all decks. (selecting the right words) All stations on all decks, make ready to detach ship's saucer section.
 PICARD / (continuing) You will command the saucer section, Lieutenant.
 WORF / I am a Klingon, sir. For me to seek escape while my captain goes into battle....
 PICARD / (interrupts hard) You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant.
 WORF / (hesitates, takes seat) Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to bridge again) Note in ship's log that at this startime, I am transferring command to the Battle Bridge. (to Data) Make the signal, Data.
 PICARD V.O. / Captain's log, stardate 42354.1. Preparing to detach saucer section.
 PICARD V.O. / ... so that families and the majority of the ship's company...
 PICARD V.O. / (continuing) ... can seek relative safety while our vessel's stardrive, containing our Battle Bridge...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... and main armaments, will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us. (turning to Tasha) Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate.
 TASHA / Understood, sir.
 PICARD / Worf, this is the Captain....
 WORF / Yes Captain?
 PICARD'S INTERCOM VOICE /  / Begin countdown.... (touches panel control) Mark!
 TROI / All decks acknowledging, sir.
 DATA / Starship separation.... six, five, four, three, two, one....
 PICARD V.O. / Ship's log, exact moment of separation, stardate 42354.22.
 As the Stardrive Section gets safely clear of the saucer, it begins turning, doubling back to face the "Q" menace. And now in the direction of that threat, / we begin to see PHOTON EXPLOSIONS in the far, far distance.
 TASHA / All torpedoes have detonated, sir.
 PICARD / (to Data) Reverse power and hold this position.
 DATA / (gives a surprised look) Reverse power...decelerating.
 TROI / That will bring them here in just minutes, sir.
 TASHA / Will we make a fight of it, Captain? If we can at least damage their ship....
 PICARD / (indicating viewer) Lieutenant... are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things? (as Tasha hesitates) I'd like to hear your advice.
 TASHA / I... spoke before I thought, sir. We should look for some way to distract them from going after the saucer.
 DATA / All forward motion stopped, sir.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Commander, signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies: we surrender. State that we are not asking for any terms or conditions.
 TROI / Aye, sir. All language forms and frequencies.
 DATA / Historically intriguing, Captain. Very, very accurate.
 PICARD / (nods) Mid-21st Century, the post-atomic horror....
 TROI / (quietly to Picard) Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream.
 PICARD / But these courts happened in our past....
 TROI / I don't understand either, but this is real. I can feel that!
 DATA / At least we are acquainted with the judge, Captain.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / You are out of order!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (continuing) The prisoners will not be harmed... (a glance at Picard) Until they are found guilty, of course.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (continuing) Dispose of that.
 PICARD / Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial?
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Yes, absolutely equitable.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (continuing to Mandarin-bailiff) Proceed.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / How plead you, criminal?
 DATA / If I may, Captain.... (gets a nod) Objection, your honor. In the year 2016, the new United Nations declared that no Earth citizen could be made to answer for the crimes of their race or forbearers.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Objection denied!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (continuing) This is a court of the year 2049, by which time more 'rapid progress' had caused all 'United Earth' nonsense to be abolished.
 PICARD / Tasha, no...
 TASHA / I must... (to "Q") ... because I grew up on a world that allowed things like this court. And it was people like these that saved me from it. I say that this so-called court should get down on its knees to what Starfleet is, what it represents... 
 TROI / (shouting to "Q") You barbarian! That girl....
 "Q" gestures and the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE / ENVELOPS HER TOO. Picard leaps in, keeps her frozen, rigid form from crashing down.
 PICARD / You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence. (to Data) Are they still alive?
 DATA / Uncertain. Lieutenant Graham was when our medics thawed him out.
 "Q" (JUDGE) glides in closer on his "bench". / 
 "Q" (JUDGE) / You will answer the charges!
 PICARD / Or what? Or this, or worse? Or death? I suggest you take a better look at human history.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / You are charged, criminals. How plead you?
 PICARD / Just a moment ago, you promised "the prisoners will not be harmed." We plead nothing so long as you break your own rules.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / I suggest you center your attention on the trial, Captain. It may be your only hope.
 PICARD / And I suggest you now may be having second thoughts about this trial! You're considering that if you conduct it fairly, which was your promise, you may lose.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (laughs) Lose?
 PICARD / Yes, even though you're judge, and prosecutor....
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (nods) And jury.
 PICARD / (considers it; nods) Accepted... so long as you keep to your agreement. (indicates Troi and Tasha) And assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / This is a merciful court.
 "Q" waves his hand DOWNWARD TO WARD TROI AND TASHA AND / A RIPPLE OF LIGHT plays over the two women, UNFREEZING THEM.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (greatly AMPLIFIED) SILENCE!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (continued) Continuing these proceedings, I must caution you that legal trickery is not permitted. This is a court of fact!
 PICARD / (same words; same time) ... court of fact! (nods) We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed of it. I recognize this court system as the one which agreed with Shakespeare's suggestion -- "Kill all the lawyers".
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (nods) Which humans did.
 PICARD / Which led to the rule: "Guilty until proven innocent".
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Of course. Bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair. (leaning in; voice amplified) YOU WILL NOW ANSWER TO THE GRIEVOUS SAVAGERY CHARGE AGAINST HUMANITY.
 PICARD / We'll be happy to answer specific charges. "Grievous savagery" could mean anything.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (interrupting) Obviously it means causing harm to fellow creatures!
 PICARD / Such as you did when you froze a member of our bridge crew? Will you be joining us in the dock here?
 "Q" (JUDGE) / You fool. Are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness? (to Mandarin-Bailiff) So be it! Present the charges.
 PICARD / I see no charges against us, your honor.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (pounds "bench top") Criminal, you are out of order!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Soldiers... (indicates guns) ... you will press those triggers if this criminal answers with any word other than "guilty"...
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Criminal, how plead you?
 PICARD / Guilty...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... provisionally so.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / The Court will hear the provision.
 PICARD / We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions. Do I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the record?
 "Q" (JUDGE) / If this is legal trickery...
 PICARD / Your own words, your Honor. (to Data) Exactly what followed his Honor's statement that the prisoner would not be harmed?
 DATA / Yes, sir. The Captain has asked the question... (in Picard's VOICE) "Can we assume this will be a fair trial?" (in Data VOICE) And in reply, the judge stated...
 DATA / (continuing in "Q"'s VOICE) "Yes, absolutely equitable."
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Unacceptable testimony, entirely unacceptable... !
 PICARD / If your Honor pleases, there is a simple way to clear up this disagreement. (waits until he has "Q"'s attention) We agree there is evidence to support the court's contention that humans have been murderous and dangerous. (moves in closer to "Q") I say "have been" ... and therefore we will respectfully submit to a test of whether this is presently true of humans.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (suddenly alert) I see, I see. (an idea forming) And you petition the Court to accept you and your comrades as proof of what humanity has become.
 PICARD / There should be many ways we can be tested. We have a long mission ahead of us...
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Another brilliant suggestion, Captain. But your test hardly requires a 'long mission'. (laughs) Your immediate destination offers more challenge than you can possibly imagine. Yes, yes, this Farpoint station will be an excellent test of human worth.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / This trial is adjourned to allow the criminals to be tested.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Captain, you may find you are not nearly clever enough to deal with what lies ahead for you. It may have been better to accept sentence here.
 "Q" WAVES TOWARD THEM, PRODUCING THE BLINDING LIGHT / EFFECT we've seen before -- and the EFFECT BECOMES:
 DATA / Uh... what is present course, Ops?
 DATA / Confirm we are on that heading, sir.
 PICARD / Actually, Ops, I've heard just the opposite.
 RIKER'S VOICE / Personal log, Commander William Riker, Star Date 42354.4, at Farpoint Station.
 RIKER'S VOICE / ... U.S.S. Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station where I await the arrival of the new U.S.S. Enterprise...
 RIKER'S VOICE / ... to which I have been assigned as first officer. Meanwhile...
 RIKER'S VOICE / ... I have been asked to visit the office of Farpoint Station's Administrator.
 ZORN /  / I thought you might like to know, Commander Riker, that we've still no word from your vessel. But, I trust we have made your waiting comfortable?
 RIKER / Luxurious is more like it. Would it seem ungrateful if I ask for some information?
 ZORN /  / Anything!
 RIKER / Fascinating how in the midst of an old city like this, you've built a completely modern tritanium and duraglass space station. Your energy supply must be as abundant as I've heard.
 ZORN /  / Geothermal energy is the one great blessing of this planet. I'll have all the details of that sent to your quarters.
 RIKER / Thank you. But it still seems incredible how you've built this station so rapidly and so... so perfectly suited to our needs.
 ZORN /  / Would your care for an Earth delicacy, Commander?
 RIKER / Well, if there's an apple there...
 RIKER / (looking up; continues) It doesn't matter... what I was saying was... (sees something out of SCENE) Well, I'll be damned!
 ZORN /  / Ah... ah yes, there was another selection here...
 RIKER / (perplexed) Zorn, I would have sworn it wasn't here a moment ago.
 ZORN /  / And does your failure to notice it make it unwelcome? (smiles) The same with Farpoint Station, Commander. (MORE)
 ZORN (Cont'd) /  / We hope a few easily answered questions about it won't make Starfleet appreciate it less.
 RIKER / I'm sure it won't, sir. (raises apple up) And this is delicious. Thank you. (crossing to door) Good morning, Groppler Zorn.
 ZORN /  / Good morning.
 ZORN /  / (continuing) You've been told not to do that. Why can't you understand? It will arouse their suspicions.
 ZORN /  / (continuing) ... and if that happens, we will have to punish you. We will, I promise you. We must!
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher...
 WESLEY / Mother, it's Commander Riker.
 RIKER / And hello to you, Wesley. Enjoying Farpoint Station?
 WESLEY / (happily) Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Saw you and thought I'd join your stroll, if I may.
 BEVERLY / Actually, we're about to do some shopping.
 RIKER / I've been meaning to visit the mall myself. If I'm welcome?
 BEVERLY / Of course.
 WESLEY / If you're wondering about Mom, Mister Riker, she's isn't actually unfriendly. She's just shy around men she doesn't know.
 BEVERLY / Wesley... ! (swallows her annoyance; to Riker) I believe that means he would like us to be friends.
 RIKER / (grins) I'm willing, Doctor. (more serious) And although we're not officially part of the Enterprise yet, I thought there might be something useful we could do while we wait.
 BEVERLY / "Useful"? How and what, Commander?
 RIKER / Investigating some things I've noticed here, Doctor. The last was a piece of fruit...
 BEVERLY / Would this be available in emerald green?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I'm sure, Commander, there are reasons for a first officer to want to demonstrate his energy and alertness to a new captain. But since my duty and interests are outside the command structure...
 RIKER / Isn't it nice he happened to have the right color?
 BEVERLY / (to Merchant) Thank you. I'll take the entire bolt. Charge it to Beverly Crusher, Chief Medical Officer, USS Enterprise.
 RIKER / Let's see, where were we?
 BEVERLY / I was accusing you of inventing work in order to curry favor with your new captain. I apologize.
 WESLEY / Finding the exact right color took him only about twelve seconds, Mom.
 BEVERLY / Maybe this is something Jean-Luc Picard will want looked into.
 RIKER / Jean-Luc? You know Captain Picard?
 WESLEY / (proudly) When I was little, he brought my father's body home to us.
 BEVERLY / Yes, Wes, long, long ago. (to Riker) Shall we continue the walk? I'd like to know you better, Mister Riker.
 MARKHAM / Where is she? They say she's never late -- not since the old burrhog took over the captain's chair.
 RIKER'S VOICE / You wouldn't be talking about the Enterprise, would you, Ensign Markham?
 GEORDI_MARKHAM / Sir. Yes, sir.
 RIKER / You can stand at ease, gentlemen. We're not on the Enterprise yet.
 MARKHAM / You know we're assigned to her, sir.
 RIKER / (extending his hand) Riker. I'm slated to be First Officer. (they shake hands) I read the service records on all new personnel on the trip out. Excellent academic record at Starfleet Academy, Mister Markham.
 MARKHAM / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / And you, Mister LaForge. Captain Dreyer praised your performance on the Hood. Why did you request transfer to the Enterprise?
 GEORDI / Who wouldn't, sir? The biggest, newest, fastest starship in the fleet --
 RIKER / Commanded by the best burrhog in the fleet. Right, Mister Markham?
 MARKHAM / (sheepishly) Yes, sir.
 RIKER / (grins) I've already forgotten who used those words.
 GEORDI / Shouldn't we have heard something from her by now, sir?
 RIKER / Yes?
 RIKER / (to Woman) What about the Saucer Module?
 GEORDI / (to Markham) Our new captain doesn't waste time.
 RIKER / A good rule for all of us to follow, gentlemen.
 RIKER / (continuing) Enterprise, this is Commander Riker on Farpoint. Standing by to beam up.
 TASHA / Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir. Captain Picard will see you on the Battle Bridge.
 TASHA / Battle bridge.
 RIKER / With the saucer gone, can I assume something interesting happened on your way here?
 TASHA / I'll let the captain explain, sir.
 DATA / We are cleared into the standard parking orbit, sir.
 PICARD / (nods) Make it so.
 TASHA / Commander Riker, sir.
 RIKER / Riker, W.T., reporting as ordered, sir.
 PICARD / I really didn't expect to welcome you to half a starship, Riker. (to Tasha) Is the viewer ready?
 TASHA / All set up, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) We'll first bring you up to date on a little... "adventure" we had on our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk.
 TASHA / (to Riker) This way, sir.
 DATA / (interrupting) Message from the Saucer Module. It will arrive here in fifty-one minutes, sir.
 PICARD / Inform them we'll hook up as soon as they arrive.
 PICARD / (to Tasha) Bring him to my Ready Room when he's done there.
 RIKER / He calls that "a little adventure"?
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Wow!
 PICARD / (laughs, nods) Exactly.
 RIKER / This "Q", sir... is he crazy? I mean, seriously?
 PICARD / Seriously, does it really matter how we judge them? We're dealing with something that can juggle starships as if they were pebbles.
 RIKER / It's a rather astonishing "little adventure" you've had, Captain.
 PICARD / (snaps) The issue isn't what we call it, Commander. The important thing is we can be dead certain... accent on dead... that "Q" wasn't joking. We're alive only because we were placed on "probation", a very serious kind of "probation".
 PICARD / (continuing) Go.
 DATA'S VOICE / The Saucer Module is now entering orbit with us, sir.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified?
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Then I meant now, Mister Riker.
 DATA / You say you will be doing this manually, sir? No automation?
 RIKER / As ordered.
 RIKER / (to Data at Conn) Two percent rise. Up angle adjustment three degrees. Maintain docking speed.
 RIKER / Level her out. Maintain docking speed. Docking crew, prepare for reconnection.
 RIKER / All stop. Her inertia should do the job now.
 RIKER / Rejoin lock-up... now.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Enterprise log, First Officer entry. Ship's modules rejoined, stardate 42354.71 with command now transferred back to the main bridge.
 TASHA / Neatly done, sir.
 RIKER / I don't imagine many mistakes happen under Captain Picard.
 TASHA / No sir, they don't.
 WORF / I'm Lieutenant Worf, sir. Captain Picard requests you come immediately to his quarters.
 PICARD / Come!
 PICARD / (continuing) A fairly routine maneuver but you handled it quite well.
 RIKER / Thank you, sir. I hope I show some promise.
 PICARD / Some coffee.
 RIKER / No thank you, sir.
 PICARD / (pours himself a cup) And now I have a kind of "what sort of second-in-command have I inherited?" question.
 RIKER / Yes sir, I thought you might.
 PICARD / I noticed in your envelope that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to Altair IV?
 RIKER / In my opinion, sir, Altair IV was too dangerous to risk exposing the captain.
 PICARD / I see. A captain's rank means nothing to you.
 RIKER / Rather the reverse, sir. A captain's life means a great deal to me.
 PICARD / Let me postulate something here, Mister Riker. Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a starship captain without knowing when it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it a little presumptuous for a first officer to second guess his captain's judgment?
 RIKER / Permission to speak candidly, sir?
 PICARD / Always.
 RIKER / You've been a first officer yourself. You know that assuming that responsibility must, by definition, include the safety of the captain. I have no problem with following the rules you lay down. But under no circumstances will I compromise your safety. If you have a problem with that, sir, you can put me back on the Hood before she leaves.
 PICARD / You don't intend to back off that position?
 RIKER / No, sir, I can't.
 PICARD / One further thing... a special favor I have to ask of you.
 RIKER / Anything, sir.
 PICARD / Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto, I'd appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard.
 RIKER / (nods) Yes, sir. And families...
 PICARD / And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a captain needs an image of "geniality" toward the little monsters, you're to see that's exactly what I project.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Welcome to the Enterprise, Mister Riker.
 WORF / Yes sir, Commander?
 RIKER / Thank you, Lieutenant. Is Commander Data on duty?
 WORF / Commander Data is on a special assignment, sir. He's using our shuttlecraft to transfer an admiral over to the Hood.
 RIKER / An admiral?
 WORF / He's been aboard all day, sir, checking over medical layout.
 RIKER / Why the shuttlecraft? Can he just beam over?
 WORF / I suppose he could, sir. But the admiral's a rather remarkable man.
 DATA'S VOICE / But, sir, the transporter could have you on the Hood in a matter of seconds, Admiral.
 DATA / No sir. But at your age, sir, I thought you shouldn't have to put up with the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft.
 DATA / Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you...
 DATA / One hundred forty-seven years, Admiral. According to Starfleet records.
 DATA / I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir.
 DATA / No, sir. I am an android.
 DATA / (at a loss, but still respectful) I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are an advanced and most honorable race.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / I will, sir.
 BEVERLY / Show me the results of Captain Picard's most recent physical examination.
 PICARD'S VOICE / Already at work, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Yes, on a subject that's very important to this mission, Captain. (unhurriedly to computer) Screen off.
 PICARD / I wanted to say "welcome aboard."
 BEVERLY / Thank you, Captain.
 PICARD / And I thought I should talk to you very personally about your assignment here.
 PICARD / (continuing) I wanted you to know I protested your posting to the Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / Oh? Do you consider me unqualified?
 PICARD / Hardly. Your service record shows you exactly the kind of CMO I'd want.
 BEVERLY / Then you must object to me personally. Has it to do with our last meeting?
 PICARD / I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor Crusher. For you to serve with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of such a terrible personal tragedy...
 BEVERLY / (annoyed; snaps) If I had any objections to serving with you, I wouldn't have requested this assignment, Captain.
 PICARD / You requested this posting?
 BEVERLY / Captain. My feelings about my husband's death will have no effect on the way I serve you, this vessel, or this mission.
 PICARD / Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. I'm pleased to have you here.
 BEVERLY / Thank you. And now, if I can return to my duties...
 PICARD / (uncomfortably) Well... as I said, "welcome Aboard".
 PICARD / Have you signaled the Hood, Mister Riker?
 RIKER / (nods) Your exact message. (in French) Bon voyage mon amie. Aye, sir.
 PICARD / And what was my answer, computer?
 "Q" (JUDGE) / DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT PATIENTLY THROUGH ALL THIS NONSENSE? OR DID YOU THINK I WAS GONE?
 PICARD / Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer, Lieutenant?
 PICARD / (continuing) If the purpose of this is to test human worth, your honor, you must let us proceed in a normal human way.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / YOU ARE DILATORY! YOU HAVE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS! ANY FURTHER DELAY AND YOU RISK SUMMARY JUDGEMENT AGAINST YOU, CAPTAIN.
 WORF / Sorry, sir...
 RIKER / No criticism. You reacted fast...
 PICARD / ... but in a completely useless way.
 WORF / I'll learn to do better, sir.
 PICARD / Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us.
 RIKER / (lowers voice) Hope you're right, sir. About the long voyage ahead.
 PICARD / I hope so too.
 RIKER / What do we do, sir? With them monitoring every move, every word...
 PICARD / S.O.P., Mister Riker.
 RIKER / Standard Operating Procedures?
 PICARD / (nods) We do exactly what we'd do if this "Q" never existed. If we're going / to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.
 PICARD V.O. / Captain's log, stardate 42372.5. Of the twenty-four hours "Q" allotted us to prove ourselves...
 PICARD V.O. / ... eleven have now passed without incident. And yet I cannot forget "Q's" prediction that we will face here some critical test of human worth.
 RIKER / This planet's interior heat results in abundant geothermal energy, sir. But it's about all this world does offer.
 PICARD / And it's your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to Starfleet standards?
 RIKER / Yes sir. We have to assume that they've been trading their surplus energy for the construction materials used here. According to our ship's scans, many of the materials used are not found on this world.
 PICARD / (smiles) Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your report as "almost magical" attempts to please us.
 RIKER / Those events did happen, sir.
 PICARD / And in time we'll discover the explanation. Meanwhile, none of it suggests anything threatening. If only every life form had as much desire to please Starfleet. (stands) Ready to beam down? I'm looking forward to meeting this Groppler Zorn.
 RIKER / I'm convinced there's more to it than just "pleasing us", sir.
 PICARD / (as they exit) Like something "Q" is doing to trick us?
 PICARD / Over here, Counselor! (to Riker) I've asked her to join us in this meeting. (indicating) May I introduce our new first officer, Commander William Riker. Mister Riker, our ship's counselor, Deanna Troi.
 TROI'S VOICE / (carrying her thoughts) Do you remember what I taught you, Izmadi? Can you still sense my thoughts?
 TROI / A pleasure, Commander.
 RIKER / (nervously) I, ah... likewise, Counselor.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Have the two of you met before?
 RIKER / We... we have, sir.
 PICARD / Excellent. I consider it important that my key officers know each other's abilities.
 TROI / We do, sir; we do.
 TROI'S VOICE / (her thoughts) I, too, would never say goodbye, Izmadi.
 PICARD'S VOICE / My crew and I need a bit more information...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... before we make our recommendations to Starfleet.
 ZORN /  / No objections to that, but... (eyeing Troi again) ... but I'm puzzled over your bringing a Betazoid to this. If her purpose here is to probe my thoughts, sir...
 TROI / I can sense only strong emotions, Groppler. I am only half Betazoid; my father was a Starfleet officer.
 ZORN /  / I have nothing to hide, of course.
 PICARD / Good, since we admire what we've seen of your construction techniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere too.
 ZORN /  / Unfortunately, Captain, we are not interested in building other facilities.
 RIKER / If I may, Captain... (gets a nod) Then a trade, Groppler? Some things you need in return for the loan of architects and engineers who can demonstrate your techniques.
 ZORN /  / We Bandi do not wish to leave our home world. If Starfleet cannot accept that small weakness, then we will be forced, unhappily, to seek an alliance with someone like the Ferengi, or...
 PICARD / Counselor... ? What is it?
 TROI / (glancing toward Zorn) Do you want it described here, sir?
 PICARD / Yes! No secrets here if we're all to be friends. (to Zorn) Agreed, Groppler?
 ZORN /  / We ourselves have nothing to hide, but...
 TROI / (another GROAN, grimacing) Pain... pain, loneliness, terrible loneliness, despair... (indicates Zorn) I'm not sensing him, sir. Or any of his people... but it's something very close to this location.
 PICARD / (to Zorn, demandingly) The source of this? Do you have any idea?
 ZORN /  / No! (stands) No, absolutely not. And I find nothing helpful or productive in any of this!
 PICARD / (stands, to Zorn) That's it? No other comment?
 ZORN /  / What do you expect form us? We offer a base designed to your needs, luxurious even by human standards...
 PICARD / ... while refusing to answer even our simplest questions about it. (to Riker) We'll adjourn for now... (to Zorn) ... while we all reconsider our positions.
 ZORN /  / Captain, the Ferengi would be very interested in a base like this.
 PICARD / Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as their other past associates.
 RIKER / Ensign, can you help me find Commander Data? I was told he's somewhere on this deck.
 RIKER / Go that way? How far?
 RIKER / (responding automatically) Thank you...
 RIKER / (snaps; interrupting) I do.
 RIKER / Hello!
 DATA / Marvelous how easily humans do that, sir. I still need much practice.
 RIKER / There are some puzzles down on the planet that Captain Picard wants answered. He suggests I put you on the away team I'll be using.
 DATA / I shall endeavor to give satisfaction, sir.
 RIKER / Uh, yes. And when the captain suggested you I, uh, looked up your record... (hesitates)
 DATA / Yes sir, a wise procedure always.
 RIKER / Your rank of lieutenant commander, I assume now must be honorary.
 DATA / No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78; honors in quantum mathematics and exobiology.
 RIKER / But your files... they say you're a...
 DATA / (waits, then) Machine? Correct, sir. Does that trouble you?
 RIKER / (hesitates) To be honest... yes, a little.
 DATA / Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human.
 RIKER / Now that troubles me. Do you consider yourself superior to us?
 DATA / I am superior in many ways. But I would gladly give it up to be human.
 RIKER / (studies Data, then) Nice to meet you, Pinocchio,
 RIKER / (continuing; explains) A joke.
 DATA / (straight-faced) Ah! Intriguing.
 RIKER / (big grin) You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data.
 DATA / This pattern is quite popular, sir. Perhaps because it duplicates Earth so well, Coming here, (apologetically) makes me feel as if I'm human too.
 RIKER / (taking it all in) I didn't believe these could be so real.
 DATA / Much of it is real, sir. If the transporters can convert our bodies to an energy beam, then back to the original pattern again...
 RIKER / Yes, of course. (indicates) And all these have much simpler patterns.
 DATA / The rear wall.
 RIKER / (peers) I can't see it.
 DATA / You will.
 RIKER / Incredible!
 WESLEY'S VOICE / (calling) Mister Riker, isn't this great?
 RIKER'S P.O.V. - THE ROCK CROSSING AT STREAM / 
 WESLEY / This is one of the simpler patterns, Mister Riker. They've got thousands more, some you just can't believe.
 RIKER / Careful, that next rock is loose... !
 WESLEY / Wow!
 RIKER / Mister Data has agreed to join my away team, Captain.
 PICARD / (with another glance toward Wes's puddle) Very good.
 PICARD / (coolly) Good idea.
 WESLEY / -- and there's a low gravity gymnasium, too. It would be hard to get bored on this ship.
 WESLEY / Mom... (beat) could you get me a look at the bridge?
 BEVERLY / That's against the captain's standing orders.
 WESLEY / Are you afraid of the captain, too?
 BEVERLY / I certainly am not!
 WESLEY / But Captain Picard is a pain, isn't he?
 BEVERLY / Your father liked him very much. Great explorers are often lonely, ... no chance to have a family...
 WESLEY / Just a look, at the bridge, Mom. From the turbolift when the doors open. I wouldn't get off. I promise.
 BEVERLY / You're looking for trouble, Wes.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Let's see what we can do.
 TASHA / Recommend that someone could begin by examining the underside of the station, sir.
 TROI / Our sensors do show some passages down there, sir. Perhaps you and I?
 RIKER / Tasha, you and the Counselor.
 RIKER / Let's us start with the topside. Have you noticed anything unusual?
 GEORDI / Well, I can't see through solid matter, sir, but the material so far looks very ordinary.
 DATA / Confirmed by the construction records, sir. Almost exactly the same material that Starfleet uses.
 RIKER / Riker to Tasha, Troi, come in!
 TASHA'S VOICE / (from communicator) We were about to call you, Team Leader. We've found something interesting.
 TASHA / We're in a passageway directly under the station sir. But the tunnel walls here are make from something we've never seen before.
 RIKER'S VOICE / And Troi, have you sensed anything there?
 TROI / Sir, I've avoided opening my mind. Whatever I sensed in the Groppler's office became very painful.
 RIKER / I'm sorry, Counselor, but you must. We need more information.
 TROI / (continuing) No, no, such pain. It's so close to us here... pain, pain..
 RIKER'S VOICE / (overlapping) Hang on, I'm coming... Enterprise, lock us onto her signal!
 RIKER / I'm sorry. Close your mind from the pain...
 TROI / It's also unhappiness... terrible despair...
 RIKER / Who?
 TROI / I don't know! No lifeform anything like us.
 RIKER / What in the hell kind of place is this? (turning) Geordi, what do you see?
 GEORDI / It's of no material I recognize, sir. Or have even heard of.
 BEVERLY / Permission to report to the captain...
 PICARD / (coolly) Children are not allowed on the bridge, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Captain, my son is not on the bridge. He merely accompanied me on the turbolift.
 PICARD / Your son?
 BEVERLY / His name's Wesley. You last saw him years ago when...
 PICARD / Oh, back then.
 PICARD / (continuing) Well -- as long as he's here...
 PICARD / I knew your father, Wesley. Want a look around?
 PICARD / (continuing; quickly) But don't touch anything!
 PICARD / (continuing) Try it out. (as Wes does so) The panel on your right is for log entries, library-computer access and retrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on.
 WESLEY / (nodding; pointing) Yes sir. And here, the backup conn and ops panels, plus armament and shield controls.
 PICARD / The forward viewscreen is controlled by the ops position...
 WESLEY / Yes sir, which uses high resolution, multi-spectral imaging sensor systems...
 PICARD / How the hell do you know that, boy?
 PICARD / Off the bridge! Both of you.
 WORF / You have a perimeter alert, Captain.
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) As my son tried to tell you!
 PICARD / Picard. Go ahead.
 PICARD / Have Mister Riker, and his team beamed back up! Security, could that be the Hood returning here?
 PICARD / Put it on main viewer!
 PICARD / Identification?
 PICARD / Hail it!
 WORF / (works his panel) We've been trying, sir. No response.
 PICARD / Raise all shields, phasers at ready.
 WORF / (works panel) Shields up, sir. Phasers ready. (turns to Picard) Could this be that "Q" you mentioned, sir?
 PICARD / I almost hope so, Lieutenant. We face too many "unknowns" already.
 PICARD / Continue universal greeting on all frequencies. Get me Groppler Zorn.
 ZORN'S VOICE /  / This is Zorn, Captain.
 PICARD'S VOICE / There is an unidentified vessel moving into orbit with us. Do you know who it is?
 ZORN /  / There are no ships scheduled to arrive until --
 PICARD / I asked if you know who it is, Groppler. You mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me.
 ZORN /  / (very nervous) But we have had no dealings with them. It was only a... a thought.
 PICARD / Are you very, very certain of that, Groppler?
 ZORN /  / I promise you we were making an empty threat, Captain. I wanted your cooperation. Forgive me --
 WORF / Definitely entering an orbital trajectory, sir.
 PICARD / All stations, give any damage reports.
 WORF / I would guess we were being scanned, sir.
 TASHA / (to Troi) Pain again?
 RIKER / (turning; sharply) Troi, you've been at it enough!
 TROI / No, I feel close to an answer of some kind.
 DATA / (interrupting) Commander, something down here is shielding our communicators.
 TROI / (comes to her feet) Yes, that's exactly the feeling I've been reading. As if someone doesn't want us to be in touch with our ship.
 RIKER / Come on... (leads the way) ... let's get to the surface.
 PICARD / Sensor scans, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Our sensor signals seem to just bounce off. (bites off words; indicates to viewer) Something's happening, sir...
 WORF / They're firing on Farpoint, sir... !
 PICARD / (toward Security position) Bring phasers and photon torpedoes to ready!
 WORF / No, hold it, sir. They're hitting the Bandi city, not Farpoint Station.
 TROI / (indicates ahead) Those stairs are where Tasha and I entered down here, sir.
 GEORDI / At this point, it becomes ordinary stone and tile, sir. (turns, puzzled) Matching what's above.
 TASHA / My God! Was that a phaser blast?
 DATA / Negative. But something similar.
 RIKER / You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam up to the ship from here. Now! (to Data) Come on, I want to see exactly what's happening.
 TROI / Don't. If you should be hurt...
 RIKER / You have your orders, Counselor! Carry them out!
 TROI / Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir.
 TROI / Enterprise, three to beam up.
 RIKER / Enterprise, Riker. Come in.
 ZORN /  / Enterprise, Enterprise, help us! Come in, please...
 ZORN'S VOICE /  / ... what shall we do? Help us, please.
 PICARD / (overlapping) Tune him down! (into transmitter) Commander Riker, go ahead. Where are you?
 RIKER'S VOICE / With Data, on the edge of the old city, Captain. It's being hit hard. Who's doing this?
 PICARD / And Farpoint Station? Any damage there?
 RIKER / Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir. Whoever they are, it seems they're carefully avoiding hitting the station.
 PICARD'S VOICE / It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered orbit with us here. No ID, no answer to our signals...
 RIKER / They're hitting the Bandi city hard, sir. Many casualties very probable.
 PICARD / (into transmitter) Understand, Commander. Would you object to a clearly illegal kidnapping assignment?
 RIKER'S VOICE / No objection; anything you order, sir.
 PICARD / Zorn may have the answers we need. Get Groppler Zorn and bring him here!
 RIKER'S VOICE / Aye, sir!
 PICARD / They're forcing a difficult decision on me, Counselor.
 TROI / (nods) But, I doubt protecting the Bandi would violate the Prime Directive. True, they are not actual allies...
 PICARD / But we are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. (turns to Tasha) Lock phasers on that vessel, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / Phasers locked on, Captain.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Typical, so typical. Savage lifeforms never follow even their own rules.
 PICARD / Get off my bridge!
 "Q" stepping toward Picard, smiling sadly. / 
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Also interesting, that order about phasers.
 TASHA / (ignoring "Q"; to Picard) Still standing by on phasers, Captain.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (turning to Picard) Please don't let me interfere. Use your weapons.
 PICARD / You're the one who has a lot to learn, "Q". With no idea of who's on that vessel, my order was a routine safety precaution.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (breaking into LAUGHTER) Really? No idea of what it represents? The meaning of that vessel is as plain as... (then taps his nose) ... as plain as the noses on your ugly little primate faces.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (trying to control it) And if you were truly civilized, Captain, wouldn't you be doing something about the casualties happening down there?
 PICARD / Captain to CMO, are you reading any of this?
 BEVERLY / Medical teams already preparing to beam down, Captain.
 PICARD'S VOICE / (relieved) Compliments on that, Doctor!
 PICARD / Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever...
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (interrupting) But not trained in clear thinking.
 PICARD / Let's consider your thoughts. You call us "savages" and yet you knew those people down there would be killed. You're the one whose conduct is uncivilized.
 WORF / Sir, they're firing on the planet again.
 PICARD / Forcefields full on. (to Worf) Go to thrusters! Position us between that vessel and the planet.
 WORF / Aye, sir, thruster power to...
 WORF / (continuing) We have no ship control, sir. It's gone!
 DATA / Are you undamaged?
 RIKER / Yes. You?
 DATA / All systems operating.
 ZORN /  / Please. You can make it stop. Drive it away.
 RIKER / Drive who away, Groppler?
 ZORN /  / I don't know.
 DATA / Unlikely, sir. (to Zorn) Our records show that you supervised all Bandi contact with other worlds...
 ZORN /  / We haven't done anything wrong!
 RIKER / Then if we can learn nothing from you, perhaps we'll leave.
 ZORN /  / (frightened) No! No, don't leave, I'll try to explain some of...
 RIKER / First officer to Enterprise.
 PICARD'S VOICE / Go ahead, Riker.
 RIKER / We've lost Zorn, sir. Something like a transporter beam, it snatched him out of here.
 "Q" still in the captain's seat, listening to: / 
 RIKER'S VOICE / Question, sir, could it have been the "Q" character you met earlier.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (laughs) None of you know who it is? You're running out of time, Captain.
 TROI / Captain... Suddenly I'm sensing something else. It's satisfaction, enormous satisfaction.
 PICARD / From the same source as before?
 TROI / No, that was on the planet. (indicates) This seems to be from here.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (to Troi) Excellent, Counselor! (indicates Picard) He's such a dullard, isn't he!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / Excellent also! (to Picard) Perhaps with more of these little minds helping, you'll...
 PICARD / (interrupting) That is enough, damn it!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / We have an agreement; have you forgotten... ?
 PICARD / We have an agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking over our vessel, interfering with my decisions! (steps up nose-to-nose) You are not welcome on my bridge. Now, either leave or finish us. One of the two!
 "Q" stands, during which we have the impression that / everyone is holding his breath. Then:
 "Q" (JUDGE) / (gently) Temper, temper, mon capitaine. I am merely trying to assist a pitiful species. Perhaps I'll leave if Mister Riker provides me with some amusement.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Do nothing that he asks!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / But I ask so little. And it is so necessary if you are to solve all this. (turns; indicates vessel image in Main Viewer) Beam over there with your... what is it called... your "away team"? (to Picard) You should already know what you'll find there. But perhaps it was too adult a puzzle for you.
 RIKER / Captain, with all respect, I intended to suggest beaming over there.
 "Q" (JUDGE) / You show promise, my good fellow.
 PICARD / But you don't. You should have long ago realized that, humanity is NOT a criminal race!
 "Q" (JUDGE) / YOU MUST STILL PROVE THAT!
 RIKER / Of the 24 hours "Q" gave us, we have less than one left, sir.
 PICARD / (nods) But I had a feeling you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful.
 RIKER / Thank you, Captain, That's the first time you've called me "Number One".
 PICARD / (small smile) I believe I'll enjoy getting to know you, Bill. If we live long enough.
 RIKER / Phasers on stun.
 RIKER / Energize.
 DATA / Most interesting, sir.
 TASHA / Much the same construction as the underground tunnel we saw.
 TASHA / (continuing) But no sound of power; no equipment. How does this ship run?
 RIKER / Troi, what is it?! (waits anxiously) Is it the same as you felt down there?
 TROI / No, this is... different. It feels much more powerful... full of anger... hate...
 TASHA / Toward us?
 TROI / No. It's directed down toward the old Bandi city.
 DATA / Most intriguing again. The place that this vessel was firing upon... (abruptly stops; to Riker) Sorry, sir, I seem to be commenting on everything.
 RIKER / (small smile) Good. Don't stop it, my friend.
 RIKER'S VOICE / Enterprise, Riker. This is turning out to be a very long tunnel or corridor, sir. Still no sign of mechanism or circuitry...
 RIKER / (continuing) ... or controls, readouts, nothing at all like any vessel I've seen before.
 TROI / (interrupting) Groppler Zorn, sir... in great fear... (motions) Just ahead.
 TROI / It's definitely Zorn, Commander. Here!
 RIKER / (stepping in) Careful...
 RIKER / Troi!!!
 ZORN /  / No! Please! No more! Please, no more...
 RIKER / (continuing) Zorn. Can you hear me?
 ZORN /  / Make it stop the pain. Please...
 TROI / Has the alien communicated... ? (breaks off; then to Riker) That's it, sir! It's just one alien that I'm sensing here.
 ZORN /  / (another GROAN) Please! I don't understand what it wants.
 TROI / (studying Zorn; then) Not true. He does know.
 ZORN /  / (in terror) No, no, please don't!
 RIKER / Away team to Enterprise...
 DATA / (interrupting; warning) Troi... !
 RIKER / Enterprise, come in. Beam us...
 DATA / Enterprise, we need help...
 PICARD / Transporter chief, yank them back! Now!
 WORF / Captain... !
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / Your time is up, Captain.
 PICARD / Get off my bridge! (into command panel) Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates?
 "Q" stepping to the command position. / 
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / He can't hear you, Captain.
 "Q" gestures upward, at which Picard is suddenly lifted / into the air and then to the side of "Q"'s hand motion in that direction.
 PICARD / "Q", I've people in trouble over / there... !
 PICARD / (continuing) Everyone, at ease! That's an order! (to "Q") My people are in trouble, "Q". Help them; I'll do whatever you say...
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / You'll do whatever I say?
 PICARD / (hesitates; nods) It seems I did make that bargain.
 TROI / The agreement isn't valid, sir. It wasn't "Q" that saved us.
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / (quickly; indicating viewer) Save yourselves! It may attack you now.
 RIKER / It was that which sent us back, Captain.
 TROI / Yes sir. It's not a vessel, sir. It's alive somehow...
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / She lies! Destroy it while you have a chance. (to Tasha) Make phasers and photon torpedoes ready... !
 PICARD / No! Do nothing he suggests!
 ZORN /  / But that thing was killing my people, Captain...
 PICARD / True, but why? Was there a reason?
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / It is an unknown, Captain! Isn't that enough?
 PICARD / If you had earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know that the unknown is what brings us out here!
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / Wasted effort, considering the human intelligence.
 PICARD / Let's test that... (to Zorn) ... starting with the tunnels you have under Farpoint, Groppler.
 RIKER / Identical to the ones on that space vessel lifeform, over there. Why was it punishing you, Groppler?
 PICARD / In return for pain you caused to some other creature?
 ZORN /  / We did nothing wrong! It was injured, we helped it...
 PICARD / (interrupting; to Zorn) Thank you, that was the missing part. (turns) Tasha, rig phasers to deliver an energy beam.
 TASHA / (puzzled) Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Yes, Captain, I understand now. It has to be conceivable that somewhere in the galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy into matter...
 PICARD / (nodding) And into specific patterns of matter. Much as our transporters do.
 TASHA / (indicating) On the viewer, Captain!
 PICARD / Zorn, you captured something like that, didn't you?
 ZORN /  / Warn my people, please! Leave Farpoint Station immediately!
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / He's lied to you, Captain. Shouldn't you let his people die?
 PICARD / (nods to Ops) Transmit the message. "Leave Farpoint immediately".
 TROI / Then it was a pair of creatures I was sensing. One down there in grief and pain, the other up here, filled with anger...
 DATA / (nodding) And firing not on the new space station, but on the old Bandi city.
 PICARD / (to "Q") Attacking those who captured it's... (to Troi) ... it's mate?
 TASHA / Energy beam ready, sir.
 PICARD / (to Tasha) Lock it in on Farpoint Station.
 "Q" stands in an annoyed manner, indicates the captain's / position to Picard.
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / I see now it was too simple a puzzle. But generosity has always been my weakness.
 PICARD / Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energize!
 TASHA / Now getting feedback on the beam, sir.
 PICARD / Discontinue it. (to Zorn) Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no Farpoint Station if I'm right about this.
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / A lucky guess!
 ZORN /  / I know we deserve this loss, but please believe me, we meant not to harm the creature, but to use it.
 TROI / Sir, a feeling of great joy. And gratitude.
 TROI / Great joy and gratitude... from both of them.
 PICARD / And why? Because it furnishes entertainment to you! You use other lifeforms for recreation.
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / If so, you've not provided the best...
 PICARD / Get off my ship, you smug hypocrite.
 "Q" (STARFLEET) / Why not? We can also meet another time, another place.
 PICARD / That's doesn't frighten us at all! You accuse us of "grievous savagery"? No, the one proven guilty of that crime is you!
 RIKER / I trust this isn't the usual way our missions will go, sir.
 PICARD / On no, Number One, I'm sure they'll be much more interesting.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 41209.2. We are running at Warp 7 to rendezvous with the science vessel S. S. Tsiolkovsky...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... which has been routinely monitoring the collapse of a red supergiant star into a white dwarf. What has brought us here is a series of strange messages indicating something has gone wrong aboard the research vessel.
 WOMAN'S COM VOICE /  / Well, hello Enterprise. Welcome... I hope you have a lot of pretty boys on board... because I'm willing... and waiting...
 DATA / (touches com panel) S.S. Tsiolkovsky, repeat your message.
 WOMAN'S COM VOICE /  / (laughter, then) In fact... we're going to have a real blowout here... Thought that would interest you. Waiting!
 DATA / Captain... what we just heard is, well...impossible.
 PICARD / Report.
 DATA / (quietly) I believe that last sound we heard was an emergency hatch being blown.
 PICARD / Are you certain... yes, of course you are.
 WORF / Sensor scan now reveals no life signs aboard, Captain.
 RIKER / Put us on their bridge, Chief.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Life support systems are not functioning in that area, sir.
 RIKER / Then put us in the main corridor. Energize.
 RIKER / Cover the ship as planned. Move out.
 DATA / Indications of what humans would call... a "wild party?"
 RIKER / Their bridge. If this thing works, be sure to record ---
 RIKER / You were right. Somebody blew the hatch and they were all sucked out into space..
 DATA / Correction, sir, blown out.
 RIKER / Thank you, Data.
 DATA / A common mistake, sir...
 RIKER / (emphasis) I know! Thank you, Data.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker, it's Lieutenant Yar, location Engineering. Ten people here, sir, all frozen. No vital signs.
 RIKER / (touches communicator) Frozen how?
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Looks to me like someone was "playing" with the environmental controls, sir. Just let all the heat bleed away into space.
 RIKER / (to Data) That's ridiculous!
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / That's what I say, sir.
 GEORDI / Sir, Lieutenant La Forge in the crew quarters. Something in here.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Hello!
 Nothing inside, Geordi decides to check the closed shower stall, yanks the door open -- and a frozen WOMAN'S BODY, fully clothed, falls out into his arms. / Although startled, Geordi has the presence of mind to catch the ice-covered corpse and lower it to the floor.
 RIKER / Riker to Captain, I have a report for you.
 PICARD / (tabs com control) Picard here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / They're all dead, sir. Some were apparently blown out the emergency hatches.
 PICARD / There were eighty people on that ship, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes sir. As I said, all dead.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are downloading the research information gathered on the collapsing...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... star nearby. I am concerned at being in such close orbit, but the Tsiolkovsky's research records...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse.
 BEVERLY / I can't find anything unusual in any of the tricorder readings they've sent over, Captain.
 PICARD / Give me a theory, Doctor. Anything!
 PICARD / (turning; continuing) Troi? Did you feel anything from over there?
 TROI / Perhaps some residual confusion... and exhilaration, too. But I'm not too certain of that.
 PICARD / Madness? Mass hysteria? Delusion?
 TROI / Any or all, Captain.
 PICARD / All right. Let's bring the away team back. Set the transporter for maximum decontamination. And then full examinations and observation when they're here.
 22   INT. ENTERPRISE SICKBAY - BEVERLY, RIKER, GEORDI, DATA / 
 BEVERLY / If you were any more perfect, Data, I'd write you up in a Starfleet medical textbook.
 DATA / I am already listed in several biomechanical texts, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Yes... of course. (to Geordi) You're next, Lieutenant.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Normal -- all across. Except... why are you perspiring?
 GEORDI / I suppose because you have it too hot in here. What else would it be?
 RIKER / That doesn't... sound exactly like you, Geordi.
 GEORDI / Maybe it wasn't. (indicates Beverly) Maybe she threw her voice.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Joke.
 BEVERLY / Of course. But I would like to run another test or two on you, Lieutenant.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Sickbay to Bridge...
 PICARD / Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I'm confining Lieutenant La Forge to Sickbay until further notice.
 PICARD / Do we have a problem, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I don't know yet.
 RIKER / Data, I need help in locating some library-computer information.
 DATA / Specifics, sir?
 RIKER / All I have is a vague memory of reading somewhere about someone taking a shower in his or her clothing.
 DATA / Ah. The body Geordi discovered.
 RIKER / And I believe it may have happened before.
 DATA / To "someone," "somewhere."
 RIKER / (amused) Should be easy for someone written up in biomechanical texts.
 DATA / About that... did the doctor believe I was boasting?
 RIKER / (dryly) Probably. (indicates viewer) This may take some time?
 DATA / At least several hours. (looks up) But what I said was a statement of fact.
 DATA / (continuing) Perhaps she will look it up.
 RIKER / You can depend on it.
 BEVERLY / Geordi!
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Security! Lieutenant La Forge just left Sickbay while my back was turned. It's important we find him.
 TASHA / (toward console) Security team alert, pick up Lieutenant La Forge who left Sickbay moments ago. (calling toward Picard) Captain, anything further?
 PICARD / Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant.
 34   INT. CRUSHER'S QUARTERS - ANGLE ON WESLEY AND GEORDI / 
 WESLEY / It's a model of the same kind of tractor beam our ship uses... with some ideas of my own added.
 GEORDI / So that's your science project. Wes, you are something!
 WESLEY / Meanwhile, the captain won't let me visit the bridge.
 WESLEY / (continuing) So I use this to imagine I'm there.
 PICARD'S VOICE / Take the helm, Mister Crusher. Set a course for thirty-seven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six.
 GEORDI / (indicates) That's the captain's voice.
 WESLEY / Pieced together from words he's used on the intercom. (indicates) I can pretend he's ordering me to take the Enterprise anywhere. And listen to this...
 PICARD'S VOICE / Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker, report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge.
 WESLEY / What d'you think?
 GEORDI / I think the captain's lucky you're on his side.
 WESLEY / But he still won't let me on the bridge. And there's nothing there I don't understand.
 GEORDI / Wish I understood myself that well.
 WESLEY / You okay?
 GEORDI / No. Suddenly I seem to be burning up inside.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Wow it's hot in here.
 TASHA'S VOICE / Geordi... ?
 TASHA / (continuing) Medical's been worried about you.
 GEORDI / (without turning) Help me.
 TASHA / Lieutenant Yar in the Observation Lounge. Send a team here now.
 GEORDI / Tasha... I said "help me." Help me not to give in to the wild things coming into my mind...
 TASHA / Geordi -- my job is security...
 GEORDI / Please.
 TASHA / Yes, helping is more important. How can I help you Geordi?
 GEORDI / Help me to see like you do.
 TASHA / But you already see better than I can.
 GEORDI / I see more. But more isn't better!
 TASHA / Geordi...
 GEORDI / I want to see in shallow, dim, beautiful human ways.
 TASHA / We'll talk about it, Geordi. (takes his arm) I'm going to take you to Sickbay now. All right?
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. I am concerned that away team member Lieutenant La Forge has been taken to Sickbay. The report: "unusual behavior."
 TASHA / ... and then we got him down to sickbay so Dr. Crusher could examine him.
 PICARD / He wasn't violent?
 TASHA / No, sir. He was very upset... he kept talking about wanting normal eyes.
 PICARD / Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll be in Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / According to our medical readouts, there's still nothing wrong with him. He looks like he's running a temperature but every instrument we have says he's not.
 PICARD / Doctor, every person on that ship over there died. Is there any chance that whatever did it is loose on my ship?
 BEVERLY / If you mean a disease, sir, I'd say there's no chance of it. We used full decontamination, we examined each team member carefully...
 PICARD / (interrupting) The entire crew over there somehow managed to kill themselves, Doctor. If it wasn't a disease, what else could have made them do that?
 BEVERLY / The obvious alternatives would be in areas of insanity, severe emotional upset... (stops short; to Troi) Troi, do you feel anything unusual in the lieutenant here?
 PICARD / (to Troi) Security reported he was longing for normal eyesight. A rather sudden yearning for that.
 TROI / Since his records show no previous mention of that, the fact that it's happened now could be important.
 TROI / (continuing) But all I feel from him is confusion. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was intoxicated.
 BEVERLY / Our tests would have shown that. Also any signs of drugs, hallucinogens or other contaminants.
 DATA / Can you provide more information, sir? Seeking an instance of someone showering with their clothing on is...is...
 RIKER / I know... like looking for a needle in a haystack.
 DATA / (puzzled) Why should anyone wish to expend their time in such a search?
 RIKER / Correction, Data, I should have said proverbial needle in a haystack.
 DATA / Ah, a human proverb! As in folklore, or an historical allusion, or tribal memories, or...
 RIKER / (interrupting) That's it! Historical! I remember now that I was reading a history of all the past starships named Enterprise.
 DATA / Enterprise history. Aberrant behavior. Medical cross reference...
 RIKER / Captain, I believe we've got the answer to what happened over there.
 PICARD / The Constitution class Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk commanding...
 RIKER / (indicates viewer) Similar conditions. They were monitoring a planet that was breaking up, not a collapsing star as in this case, but there were the same huge shifts in gravity...
 PICARD / (peers closely) ... which somehow resulted in complex strings of water molecules which then acquired carbon from the body and acted on the brain like alcohol! (to Data) Mister Data, download that information immediately to medical.
 DATA / Aye sir, downloading.
 PICARD / Fascinating! Their entire crew going out of control...
 RIKER / Like intoxication but worse. Judgment almost completely impaired...
 PICARD / Until they found this formula, barely in time. (moves to his own console) Picard to Doctor Crusher, come in.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / This is Crusher; go ahead Captain.
 PICARD / You can relax, Doctor. The answer to all this is feeding into your medical banks now... including a cure.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Are you certain, Captain?
 PICARD / Absolutely!
 TROI / Tasha?
 TROI / (continuing) What're you doing?
 TASHA / I need your advice. That's why I came to your quarters.
 TROI / Of course. Anything I can do ---
 TASHA / (interrupting) On clothes. You always wear such beautiful clothes off duty. And your hair's so nice all the time. I want to change my image. (holds up dress) What about this color?
 TROI / Not for you. Tasha, I feel you're very uncertain... that you're fighting something.
 TROI / (continuing) What is it?
 TASHA / Never mind. I'll find what I need myself. Ship's Stores will have it.
 TROI / Tasha, wait ---
 TROI / (continuing) Troi to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Picard here.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Sir, I think Tasha's been infected, too. She's just left my quarters...
 PICARD / It's not actually an "infection," Counselor.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Yes sir, it's more like intoxication, but whatever it is, she's got it.
 PICARD / Thank you, Counselor. (to Riker) Number One, our security chief has the equivalent of a snootful.
 DATA / (to Picard) Inquiry, sir... 'snootful?'
 PICARD / Forget it!
 WESLEY (V.O) / Mom, Look what I can do...
 WESLEY / (continuing) I've been able to widen and strengthen the beam, just like I told you last night ---
 BEVERLY / Do me a favor, Wes? There's something happening on this ship... (shrugs) Just to be safe, I'd like you to stay in our quarters until it's solved.
 WESLEY / (slightly silly grin) Right, Mom, right. Your wish is my...
 BEVERLY / Now, Wes.
 WESLEY / (another grin) You could be stunting my emotional growth, you know. (wipes forehead) Why's it so hot in here, anyway?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Crusher. Have you made a test injection yet? We're getting indications that this condition is spreading.
 BEVERLY / No test yet, Captain, but very soon.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Come to Papa; come to Papa... !
 DATA / Captain, in another forty-one minutes will see the information from the Tsiolkovsky downloaded to us.
 PICARD / Why so slow?
 DATA / Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating it.
 PICARD / (indicates viewer) How much danger from that star? Worse case.
 DATA (V.O.) / Like a full collapse, sir?
 DATA / (continuing) Any stellar material it threw this way we could still outrun on half impulse power.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Engineering. Chief engineer report to the bridge.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (continuing) Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda report to Medical.
 WESLEY / Hi, Jim. Was that the captain sending you to Medical?
 SHIMODA / Which would leave no one on duty here. The chief was just summoned to the bridge.
 WESLEY / What about me? I could call your chief on the bridge if anything happens.
 60   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD AND MACDOUGAL / 
 MACDOUGAL / Reporting as ordered, sir.
 PICARD / What?
 MACDOUGAL / You ordered me to report to the bridge, sir.
 PICARD / I did no such thing. I want you down in the Engine Room in case we need to move out of here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Attention all decks, all divisions. Effective immediately, I have handed over control of this vessel to Acting Captain Wesley Crusher.
 PICARD / Acting Capt...
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Thank you, Captain Picard, thank you. And with that order dawns a brave new day for the Enterprise.
 PICARD (V.O) / Captain's log, Stardate 41209.3. The strange contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now aboard the Enterprise... and our Engineering Section has been commandeered by young Wesley Crusher...
 PICARD / (continuing) Number One, MacDougal -- get that boy out of Engineering.
 WORF / Sir, I'm getting very strange reports from all decks --
 PICARD / Such as?
 WORF / Such as the ship's training division ordering all officers to attend a lecture on metaphysics.
 PICARD / Metaphysics?
 DATA / Confirmed, sir. And there is a rather peculiar limerick being delivered by someone in the shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure I understand it... (quoting) There was a young lady from Venus whose body was shaped like --
 PICARD / (interrupting) Captain to Security, come in!
 DATA / (to Worf) Did I say something wrong?
 WORF / (shrugs) I don't understand their humor either.
 SECURITY COM VOICE / (lazy, uninterested) Yeah, Captain?
 PICARD / Where's my security chief?! Get me Lieutenant Yar.
 SECURITY COM VOICE / Keep your britches on, Captain.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard...
 PICARD / Yar, where are you?
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / I'm in my quarters and pretty busy right at this moment, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / (gathering self together) All right, Lieutenant, just stay right there. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (turning) Data, please go to Lieutenant Yar and get her down to Sickbay.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (into console) Security, I want all your senior supervisors to report to the bridge immediately.
 WESLEY / ... and a dessert course shall henceforth precede and follow every meal. Including breakfast.
 CREWMAN / Hurray for the acting captain!
 SHIMODA / Never got as far as Sickbay, Wes. I feel too good for that.
 SHIMODA / (continuing) Incredible! How did you do that?
 WESLEY / (indicating) Hooked my model tractor beam into ship's power. Now its a repulser beam too. (eyeing Shimoda) Want in?
 SHIMODA / Swear to be faithful to you, Captain!
 DATA / Lieutenant Yar?
 TASHA'S VOICE / Here, Data.
 TASHA / (continuing) You wanted me?
 DATA / Captain Picard ordered me to escort you to Sickbay, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / Did he say when?
 DATA / (considering it, then) I am sure he meant "now." (indicates) So you need time to get into uniform...
 TASHA / But I got out of uniform for you, Data. Do you know how old I was when I was abandoned?
 DATA / Chronological age? No, I am afraid I am not conversant with your ---
 TASHA / Five. Five years old, but I survived. I learned how to stay alive, how to avoid the rape gangs. I was fifteen before I escaped.
 DATA / I am sorry. I did not know...
 TASHA / And what I want now is gentleness. And joy. And love.
 TASHA / (continuing) From you, Data. You are fully functional, aren't you?
 DATA / Of course, but...
 TASHA / How fully?
 DATA / In every way, of course. I have been programmed in multiple techniques, a broad variety of pleasuring...
 TASHA / You jewel! That's exactly what I hoped.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / What have you learned, Number One?
 RIKER / Captain, the ship's engines are cut off from the bridge. And I have the reason. The assistant chief engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips from command and all engines are off-line.
 RIKER / (continuing) Wesley's hooked some kind of tractor beam into ship's power and has it aimed at the door. We can't get past it to get at the computer.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Can you short out the power?
 MACDOUGAL / Maybe. (considers) Yes, I can. But it's going to take time.
 PICARD / Do it!
 TROI'S VOICE / Bill...
 RIKER / Deanna, what -- ?
 TROI / So many minds on this ship, Bill... all free... released...
 RIKER / Deanna --
 TROI / I can feel them all... what they feel... what they want... I feel a side of humans I've never felt before.
 RIKER / Come on, I'm getting you to Sickbay.
 TROI / Wouldn't you rather be alone with me -- with me in your mind...
 BEVERLY / The medical records we found say this works almost instantly.
 GEORDI / I've never seen a rainbow, Doc. Sunset. Sunrise. None of those. This is going to help me?
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher...
 RIKER / Didn't you hear me? Deanna needs your help.
 BEVERLY / The formula from the old Enterprise didn't work.
 RIKER / What?
 BEVERLY / This water-carbon complex may induce the same symptoms, but it's different somehow. Maybe it's mutated. I'll have to isolate it... analyze it...
 RIKER / We don't have that kind of time.
 BEVERLY / You brought Deanna in?
 RIKER / She's infected with it, too.
 BEVERLY / You touched her? Oh, God, you touched me. (then) You can't leave here --
 RIKER / If we don't get our command computers back on-line soon, this -- whatever this is -- won't matter. We'll all be dead.
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. It is no longer an inconvenient childish prank. Young Wesley Crusher... (beat; softening) Admittedly a victim of the Tsiolkovsky "infection"...
 PICARD (V. O.) / (continuing) ... is now in control of my starship. How he acquired the engineering information and knowledge he is using, I have no idea.
 PICARD / (continuing) Wes, this is Captain Picard. Do you see me?
 WESLEY / Yes sir?
 PICARD / You will now return all control of this vessel to the bridge where it belongs. Now.
 WESLEY / I'm sorry, sir. Why don't you just tell me what you want done and I'll...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Because ship captains control their own vessels, young man!
 WESLEY / But, sir, you don't do it yourself. You give the orders, someone else does it. What's wrong with giving me the orders to do it?
 WORF / Captain, getting unusual readings now from the dwarf star... !
 PICARD / Stand by a moment on that. (toward main viewer) Wesley... ! (softens it) Wes... are you aware that you're acting strangely... that a kind of "infection" was brought back from the Tsiolkovsky that acts like intoxication?
 WESLEY / (considers it) Are you saying that's why I feel so... so "hot," so strange?
 PICARD / That's a very adult bit of reasoning, Wes...
 WESLEY / Are you saying I'm "drunk?" I feel strange but also good.
 PICARD / Because... (corrects his tone of voice) Because you've lost the capacity for self-judgment. Alcohol does that but this contaminant we've brought back does it even more so.
 WESLEY / What would you do if you got your ship back?
 PICARD / It's very important I do because we must immediately put a tractor beam on the Tsiolkovsky, then tow it out of...
 WESLEY / Tractor beams are my specialty, Skipper! I'll contact you when that's done; Wesley out!
 PICARD / Wes!
 PICARD / (continuing) Conn, where are you headed?
 WORF / Sir! (indicating viewscreen) The star; it's beginning to collapse.
 PICARD / What the hell is happening in Engineering?
 88   INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - ANGLE ON WESLEY AND SHIMODA / 
 WESLEY / Lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock on... lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock on...
 MACDOUGAL / You got the logic probe? (he hands it to her) Thanks.
 RIKER / Where's the sonic driver?
 MACDOUGAL / There. Let's see if this'll cut out his tractor beam power.
 BEVERLY / Oh no! No, I must find the answer. Find the answer. Have to find the answer.
 WORF / Captain -- tractor beam! We just locked onto the Tsiolkovsky!
 PICARD / Bridge to... to Wesley. (waits; then) Wesley Crusher, come in!
 PICARD / (continuing) Data! At least you're functioning.. !
 DATA / Fully, Captain, fully.
 PICARD / Data, intoxication is a human condition. Your mind is different, it's not the same...
 DATA / We are more alike than unlike, my dear captain.
 DATA / (continuing) I have pores. Humans have pores. (turns hands over) I have fingerprints. Humans have fingerprints. My chemical nutrients are like your blood. (looks appealingly at Picard) If you prick me, do I not leak?
 PICARD / If this can possibly wait, Doctor...
 BEVERLY / May I see you in your Ready Room? It's a private matter... well, actually an urgent one...
 PICARD / I'm busy, Doctor. Impossible.
 PICARD / (continuing) Damn!
 BEVERLY / I believe I'm infected myself.
 PICARD / Do you know what the infection is? Hurry!
 BEVERLY / Sorry. (wipes off smile) It is definitely like alcohol intoxication, the same lack of good judgment... (smiling sexily again) For example right now, I find you, well, extremely...extremely... (stops) Of course we haven't time for that sort of thing...
 PICARD / What sort of thing?
 BEVERLY / (eyeing his body) Oh God would I love to show you.
 PICARD / Doctor, there must be a cure! Some formula, similar to the old one...
 BEVERLY / (holding Picard's hand) Dammit... dammit, dammit, my dear captain. You owe me something. You do realize that, don't you? I'm a woman; I haven't the comfort of a husband, a man...
 PICARD / Not now, Doctor, please...
 WORF / (low) Bridge to Riker, urgent!
 RIKER / Riker here.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Sir, regret to inform you that the captain appears to be infected. And Data, and...
 RIKER / (all he needs) Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm coming. (to MacDougal) You'll have to handle this.
 MACDOUGAL / Are you saying you'll handle that?
 WORF / What we're seeing, sir, is a huge chunk of the star's surface blown off, heading for us!
 PICARD / Take us... (wipes perspiration)
 RIKER / Are you alright, sir?
 PICARD / Worf, you know what to do. Take us out of here.
 WORF / Sir, the controls are still off-line!
 PICARD / Override!
 WORF / (tries, then) Same result, sir.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Wes, come in please. Wesley Crusher, this is Riker. Come in. This is urgent!
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Engineering, urgent. We must have ship's power...
 MACDOUGAL / Oh, no, those are control chips... ! (finds a com button) Bridge from Engineering...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / The star is still collapsing; we're directly in the path of...
 MACDOUGAL'S COM VOICE / I can't help you, bridge! Someone's yanked out all the control chips here...
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / It was an adult who did it!
 WORF / I estimate fourteen minutes until that mass gets here... !
 MACDOUGAL'S COM VOICE / No way to replace chips in fourteen minutes, sir. I'd guess two hours, maybe three...
 WESLEY'S VOICE / Data could assemble them back faster.
 PICARD / What's that? (hits a com control) What's that Wesley?
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / They're just simple isolinear chips, sir. To Data, anyway. He could shuffle them like cards.
 RIKER / (overlap) Come on Data. Hurry!
 RIKER (V.O.) / Ship's log, First Officer Riker. The star has begun disintegrating. Enterprise will be destroyed unless it can be moved out of the path of the star material hurtling...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... toward us. Our only hope is for Lieutenant Commander Data in the time we have left, to regain his senses and reconnect engine power to the Bridge.
 WESLEY / Hi, Mister Data.
 DATA / Nice to see you, Wesley. What... ?
 RIKER / (overlapping; urgently indicating) Data! We need the engines on-line in a hurry, remember?
 WESLEY / Oh yes, I remember too. (to Data) So, Data, if you don't mind...
 RIKER / (fast; to Wesley) We've no time for courtesy! (fast; to Data) Get those damned control chips back in place, Data! In the correct order!
 RIKER / (continuing) NOW!
 WESLEY / (to Data) It's like a game of 'how fast can you do it?'
 DATA / Ah, a game!
 WESLEY / I think I can switch this to the main viewer, sir...
 RIKER / We've got eight or nine minutes, at most, Data. Can you finish by then?
 DATA / No. This will take slightly more time than we have, sir.
 RIKER / Dammit, NO! I can't afford to get it!
 PICARD / Beverly...
 BEVERLY / Yes, Jean-Luc?
 PICARD / You will address me as Captain!
 BEVERLY / In which case, dear Captain, you will address me as 'Chief Medical Officer' or 'Doctor.'
 PICARD / (befuddled; then) That's true; I started off calling you 'Beverly,' then naturally, you... (shakes head) I'm still not thinking straight!
 BEVERLY / Likewise. Where the hell was I just headed?
 PICARD / (indicates hypo) If that's something you wanted to test...
 BEVERLY / (suddenly remembering) Yes, yes, on Geordi!
 WESLEY / Did you see how I reversed fields on this, Commander? Made it into a repulser beam.
 DATA / If we had just a minute more, sir...
 WESLEY / If this were a hundred times more powerful than it is...
 BEVERLY / I made this a broader based remedy... I hope. But it's still close to the formula from the old Enterprise's records...
 PICARD / Decades ago, light years away...
 BEVERLY / But almost exactly the same conditions as here.
 GEORDI / What was in that, Doctor? My head's beginning to clear...
 BEVERLY / Take this to Engineering. I'll make up more hypos for the others.
 WESLEY / Why not try it with the real thing?! (to MacDougal) Why not reverse fields on this, Ma'am? If we only need an extra minute...
 MACDOUGAL / It would take weeks of laying out new circuits...
 WESLEY / But why not just see it in your head? (thinks, presses switches) Come off the main lead, split at the force activator, then...then... (puzzled) If I could just think straight about this...
 RIKER / We didn't make it, Captain. If we had just a minute or so more...
 WESLEY / Yes, then reversing power leads, back through the force activator... repulser beam hard against the Tsiolkovsky...
 RIKER / We're pushing away!
 RIKER / (continuing; into communicator) Bridge, engage engines!
 GEORDI / Sir, something seemed to move us aside at the last minute.
 WORF / (into his com) Do we owe our thanks to Commander Data, sir?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes. And... Wesley may have given us a few seconds, too.
 WORF / Did he say Wesley? The boy?
 BEVERLY / He said Wesley.
 RIKER / It is only fair to mention Wesley in a log entry, sir.
 PICARD / (stops; nods) Fair is fair. And let's credit his science teacher, too.
 GEORDI / Congratulations, sir.
 PICARD / To many people.
 TASHA / Data! I'm only going to tell you this just once... It never happened.
 PICARD / I put it to all of you we may end up with a fine crew... if we keep working at it. (nods for emphasis; then) So let's get to our next job, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. Helm, stand by for warp three. Heading two-hundred ninety-four mark thirty-seven.
 GEORDI / Warp three, two-hundred ninety-four mark thirty-seven, sir.
 RIKER / Engage!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41235.25. Our location planet Ligon II, source of a rare vaccine needed on Federation planet Styris IV. Starfleet has instructed me...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... to engage in a friendly visit and open treaty negotiations to acquire this medicinal substance.
 GEORDI / Standard orbit, sir.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Yar is calling from Cargo Bay One, sir. Standing by to beam Ligonian welcoming party aboard.
 PICARD / (rising) On our way. You have the helm, Mister Data.
 PICARD / (continuing; toward controls) Cargo One. (to Riker and Troi) Should be an interesting experience.
 RIKER / Agreed. Not only are they closely humanoid but their history has remarkable similarities to ours.
 TROI / But a highly structured society and they're exceedingly proud.
 TASHA / They've insisted on using their own transporter device, sir...
 PICARD / (nods) It's their way, Lieutenant. Do they have our coordinates?
 TASHA / They have, sir. Precisely. And they're standing by for your signal.
 PICARD / This is Captain Picard of the Starfleet vessel Enterprise. Please... (looks to Troi; she nods) ... please do us the honor of visiting our vessel.
 TASHA / (quietly to Picard) Nothing concealed, sir.
 LUTAN / I am Lutan.
 PICARD / Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. These are my officers. Second in command, Commander William Riker; Ship's Counselor Deanna Troi; my security officer, Lieutenant Tasha Yar.
 LUTAN / A woman? Your Chief of Security?
 PICARD / Yes, Lutan: that is her expertise.
 LUTAN / I am honored to meet your officers. (indicates Hagon) And this is my Secondary, Hagon. (indicates) A sample of the vaccine.
 TASHA / My duty, Lutan.
 TASHA / (continuing) Sorry, I am required to inspect...
 HAGON / Aside, little one...
 HAGON / (continuing) This... this is a woman?
 LUTAN / (inspecting Tasha) How interesting! (then, to Picard) May we prove as surprising to you.
 TROI / (low voice) If I may suggest, sir...
 TROI / (continuing) No apology. In their view, it would weaken us.
 RIKER / Nothing concealed, Captain. (extends it) Do you care to accept it?
 HAGON / Yes, yes, please do.
 LUTAN / (to Tasha) Unless you care to examine it further.
 PICARD / Absolutely not. This vaccine sample is a gift of life and we are honored at receiving it. (indicates way into vessel) Will you do us the honor of letting us entertain you now?
 LUTAN / (nodding) You may prepare it. We will join you shortly.
 HAGON / I ask forgiveness....
 LUTAN / (cuts him off) They are strange alien things. You bear no fault...
 HAGON / But the female...
 LUTAN / May be exactly what I've needed.
 PICARD / Lutan, we're aware of many of your planet's achievements, and its unique similarity to an ancient Earth culture, which we all admire. On behalf of the Federation, therefore, I am proud to present to you this token of gratitude and friendship. From China's Sung Dynasty, Fourteenth Century.
 DATA / (to Picard) Thirteenth Century, sir.
 PICARD / Indeed?
 LUTAN / (accepting and admiring it) It is a most thoughtful gift. We are grateful.
 LUTAN / (continuing) We from Ligon have always been apprehensive about strangers. We are not as technologically advanced as you; yet we possess something you do not -- a vaccine which has been found to be an effective antidote to your deadly Anchilles fever. If your conduct toward us is worthy -- if you respect our customs -- and if we see this respect -- we will become friends. Then, we will make the vaccine available to all who need it.
 PICARD / If you require respect from us, I'm certain you will see it.
 LUTAN / Surrounded by such friendship, I have no need of my guards. (to guards) I will return shortly. Prepare to transport me then.
 PICARD / If there is something else, any final courtesy...
 LUTAN / Is it possible to see one of your wondrous holodecks? We have heard how they are used to train your officers.
 PICARD / And used for many other things too. (turning) Commander Riker, perhaps you and Counselor Troi can demonstrate.
 LUTAN / Is it possible for Lieutenant Yar to do so Captain? Some demonstration of defense training?
 RIKER / We've noticed you are intrigued by her having security responsibilities. But such things are not at all unusual with us.
 HAGON / With us, it is the duty of women only to own the land, and the duty of men to protect and rule it.
 TROI / (amused) Much the same has happened in human history too.
 TASHA / I'd like to do it, sir. (to Lutan) As a sign of respect, perhaps.
 PICARD / (nods agreement) Very well.
 TASHA / This way, please.
 TASHA / (continuing) Aikido. One.
 TASHA / (continuing; amicably) It won't move until my actions activate it.
 LUTAN / You can create people? Without a soul?
 TASHA / It's not a real person, Lutan. It has no life. Everything it does is controlled by computer.
 TASHA / (continuing; to the image) Who am I? Do you hear me?
 TASHA / (continuing) But it will feel real when it hits you.
 HAGON / A force like that cannot possibly come from an image, Lutan.
 LUTAN / Then you will show me, Hagon.
 HAGON / (trying to breathe) Oh. . . . Oh...
 LUTAN / (to Tasha) Thank you, Lieutenant. How very enlightening.
 TASHA / (into the air) Aikido, vanish.
 TASHA / (continuing) I could create two -- even three, but one is really enough. As you fight with it, it learns, and before long it knows exactly how to defeat you.
 LUTAN / (a smile) Even the extraordinary Lieutenant Yar?
 TASHA / (also a smile) It forces us to keep improving.
 LUTAN / Your skill impresses me. I like you.
 LUTAN / (continuing) Farewell, my new friends of the noble Enterprise.
 PICARD / Understanding has made friends of many different people. We've had a good beginning, Lutan.
 LUTAN / May I also extend a personal farewell to Lieutenant Yar?
 LUTAN / In your Federation terms.
 PICARD / Picard to bridge. Red alert!
 RIKER / Shields up; activate photon torpedoes!
 PICARD / What com contact have we had with them?
 DATA / With their orbital control station, sir.
 PICARD / (reaches his position) Make contact there and on all hailing frequencies. (touches control panel) Enterprise to Lutan and Ligonian government. You have committed an unfriendly act. You will reply immediately.
 RIKER / Photon torpedoes ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Set for a display blast, a thousand meters short of planet surface. Fire!
 RIKER / Display blast away!
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Do we know the source of their transporter beam?
 GEORDI / Our own transporter people tried to trace it, sir, but without effect.
 DATA / It reads similar to Starfleet's early efforts but uses the Heglenian shift to convert matter and energy in different... (stops; seeing Picard's expression) ... which is actually not important at this time.
 PICARD / (touching panel com) This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise with a message to Lutan whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us, Lutan. And having visited us here, Lutan, you must certainly understand the power of our vessel. We have so far fired only a warning burst at you. We insist you reply to this message.
 PICARD / (continuing) Opinion, Counselor. Will they injure Tasha?
 TROI / I believe not, sir. In fact, they seem mainly curious. But in the case of Lutan I did feel other needs.
 RIKER / What kind of needs?
 TROI / Some sexual attraction from all the males. Lieutenant Yar is physically very attractive. But I felt something else in the case of Lutan... something more like... avarice or ambition.
 PICARD / Other comments?
 DATA / If I may, sir... one of the things about them in the briefing studies was their respect for patience.
 RIKER / (nods) Strongly emphasized. And you can see it in the precise, ritualistic way they do things. I'm worried about Lieutenant Yar too, sir, but maybe we should sit and wait them out.
 PICARD / Analysis, the two of you. Everything we know about them and how these happenings fit into that.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned. Over a full day of waiting with no response from...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... Lutan. We are now testing whether they are aware of our sensors probing them. So far, we believe we have pinpointed Lutan's government compound.
 BEVERLY / The vaccine, sir...
 PICARD / (rises) Yes, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / The vaccine... (stops; shudders) I'm a... physician; I've seen death. But not on the scale this could mean.
 PICARD / Meanwhile, you were testing whether we can replicate the vaccine...
 BEVERLY / And we can't! Their sample works fine when used as an injection, but it becomes unstable when we try to replicate it. You must get vaccine from the planet, Captain. As much as you can. Immediately!
 PICARD / I'm aware of that, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / You've never had to watch a patient die from this disease.
 PICARD / That's true. But I've seen my share of death.
 BEVERLY / Damn! (weak smile; shakes her head) Where are the calluses we doctors are supposed to grow over our feelings?
 PICARD / Perhaps the good ones never get them.
 PICARD / (continuing; hopeful) Yes, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (hesitates; then) May I speak about my son Wesley?
 PICARD / (startled) What? (recovers) Well, yes. Yes, of course.
 BEVERLY / He's so interested in starship operations. And... (smiles) ... speaking as a mother, of course, he seems quite knowledgeable.
 PICARD / Well, yes... speaking as a mother...
 BEVERLY / (indicates; interrupting) He's on the turbolift. You'll remember you ordered him to stay off the bridge.
 WESLEY / (weakly) I haven't stepped one foot on your bridge, Captain...
 RIKER / It's all right, sir, I'll see he leaves immediately...
 PICARD / No.
 RIKER / (halts) No?
 PICARD / (to Wesley) Why don't you sit at Ops? Next to Lieutenant La Forge.
 WESLEY / Sir?
 GEORDI / Sir?
 PICARD / Is the whole ship deaf?! (indicates) Sit down over there, young man! (beat) Temporarily.
 TROI / Captain, we have more information from the briefing studies on Ligon...
 PICARD / Excuse me. (calls) Doctor Crusher, some of this may interest you.
 PICARD / (continuing) Proceed with your analysis.
 DATA / It is a highly structured society in which people live by strict codes of honor. For example, what Lutan has done is similar to what certain American Indians once did, called "counting coup." That's from an obscure language called French --
 PICARD / A language which for centuries on Earth represented civilization, Mister Data.
 DATA / Indeed?
 RIKER / I suggest you drop it, Mister Data.
 DATA / Yes sir. Counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemy with a stick in battle, or taking something from him and escaping. It was considered extremely heroic.
 RIKER / And under these circumstances Lutan considers himself heroic, risking literally everything in the face of our superior power.
 TROI / And it fits Lutan's personality profile as well. He has an abnormally high need for achievement -- I've sensed it in him, very strongly.
 TROI / (continuing) We should establish clearly also, that Lutan is dangerous. Self image for him is a function of how much he THINKS he's achieved. Those who set their standards too high can kill to meet them.
 BEVERLY / Why Tasha?
 TROI / As a Starfleet security officer, she may have represented his riskiest prize.
 DATA / (to Picard) Transmission from the planet surface, sir... Main viewer on.
 PICARD / Yes, Lutan? What do you wish?
 LUTAN / You will display your image, please.
 PICARD / What is required is an image of Lieutenant Yar, well and...
 LUTAN / (interrupting) Are you making demands, Captain?
 TROI / Sir...
 TROI / (continuing) According to the Ligon Code of Honor, Lutan has done what he set out to do -- achieve recognition for being daring and bold.
 RIKER / We've studied this in some depth now, sir. The proper thing for you to do now is to ask to get Tasha back.
 PICARD / (astonished) Ask for her?
 DATA / Politely, Captain.
 PICARD / (touches com button) And now, Lutan... (swallows irritation) You have boldly taken the lieutenant from us and I ask that you... now please return her.
 LUTAN / Then come visit us, Captain, and we will return her to you.
 RIKER / First Officer to Transporter Chief...
 TROI / (interrupts) Forgive me but can you delay calling him?
 DATA / (nods agreement) Please. We must discuss the away party.
 PICARD / Am I included?
 DATA (O.S.) / It concerns you directly, Captain.
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / Wesley. It's time we left.
 PICARD / Wesley... thanks for taking a turn at the controls.
 WESLEY / Yes sir.
 TROI / Commander....
 RIKER / "Commander?" That's quite formal...
 TROI / So is this request, sir. We believe it would be preferable if the captain led this away party.
 DATA / Agreed, sir. Their customs concerning guests make it much preferable.
 RIKER / (to Picard) And I'm very much against it. Lutan is clearly a liar, and devious. Counselor Troi has admitted she believes him capable of killing. It is my duty to keep the captain out of danger, sir.
 DATA / Except that Ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leader becomes an honored guest. (indicates) Not us, not second in command... him.
 TROI / And the custom requires Lutan to die rather than violate that.
 RIKER / Yes... it does sound reasonable put that way. (to Picard) I warn you, Captain... if you get hurt, I'll put you on report!
 LUTAN / Welcome to my Centerplace, Captain Picard. Consider yourselves my honored guests.
 YAREENA (O.S.) / Every hospitality will be accorded you.
 LUTAN / This is my First One, Yareena.
 PICARD / Lutan is a fortunate man.
 PICARD / (continuing) You've met Counselor Troi.
 LUTAN / Yes. (to Picard) As on your vessel, you have only to name whatever courtesy we can provide.
 PICARD / Then, sir... the courtesy of seeing Lieutenant Yar.
 LUTAN / Lieutenant Yar will be returned to you tonight at a banquet I have arranged in your honor.
 PICARD / I would like to see her now.
 LUTAN / (thinks; then, to a sentry) Bring Lieutenant Yar. (to Picard) I find it odd, Captain, that a man of your experience has such difficulty in understanding ordinary politeness.
 PICARD / Such as saying "please" when abducting someone?
 LUTAN / The expression "please" is used only when requesting the person back.
 PICARD / Yours is a different world.
 LUTAN / With clear and simple ways deeply rooted in our culture. If you are willing to ask for Lieutenant Yar's release tonight in front of all, honor will be satisfied.
 TROI / (to Picard) One can see the importance of "honor" here.
 LUTAN / Honor is everything.
 HAGON / There will be gifts for each of you, to absolve the abduction.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, have you been treated well?
 TASHA / Fine, Captain... (indicates bandaged guard; smiles) ... but they're showing some signs of wear.
 YAREENA / There isn't any need to be concerned, Captain. She's being well cared for.
 PICARD / My ship's company and I are certain of your gentle wisdom in that.
 LUTAN / I thought for a moment I heard a threat implied. (shrugs) But that would be foolishness.
 PICARD / Something to be carefully avoided I agree.
 LUTAN / The festivities for her return to you are in preparation. Shall we retire until then?
 PICARD / Until tonight, Lutan.
 LUTAN / We present you gifts!
 PICARD / Lutan, you have granted us hospitality and the safety of your Centerplace. The gifts you give us are rare and precious. We thank you. In accordance with the customs of your ancestors, which I honor and respect, I am here in peace to ask for the return of Lieutenant Yar.
 LUTAN / Well spoken. There are some among my equals in this gathering who were wary of my approaching the Federation. I am proud to have taken this first step towards a treaty -- and proud we have something of great value to offer you -- a priceless life-giving vaccine. (beat) The abduction I have done according to our custom, for all to see. (great applause) Your conduct in this matter has been beyond exemplary, Captain Picard -- (glances at Tasha) -- but now that the moment has come, I find I cannot part with her.
 PICARD / You speak of a code of honor... but what you are now saying is called under our customs... an act of war.
 LUTAN / No, no, Captain! You do not understand.
 PICARD / Correct! I am now beyond understanding!
 LUTAN / This is not an act of war, but of love. I want Lieutenant Yar to become my First One.
 YAREENA / I challenge your right of supercedence!
 HAGON / (at Yareena) No woman has challenged supercedence for over two-hundred years!
 YAREENA / The right is mine -- and I will have it! (then to Tasha, furious) Natasha Yar -- I challenge you! A struggle to the death!
 PICARD / (strongly) NO! The challenge is unequivocally refused!
 LUTAN / Then you shall have no treaty -- no vaccine -- and no Lieutenant Yar!
 RIKER (V.O.) / Ship's log, First Officer Riker reporting. We have been informed of the challenge to Lieutenant Yar...
 RIKER / (continuing) ... and are maintaining combat readiness round-the-clock. We are probing Lutan's compound deeply with our sensors now, still unnoticed.
 TASHA / Captain. Deanna.
 PICARD / Did you have any idea, Lieutenant, that Lutan would suddenly announce he wanted you for his First One? What do you know of this?
 TASHA / Nothing, sir.
 TROI / (as if to herself) But it was a thrill. Lutan is such... such a basic male image and having him say he wants you...
 TASHA / (nods) Yes, of course it made me feel good...
 TASHA / (continuing) Troi! I'm your friend and you tricked me!
 TROI / Only so you'll think about it completely and clearly.
 PICARD / (to Tasha) We're all being manipulated, Lieutenant, and most of all myself.
 TROI / (scrutinizing Picard) How simple all this would be without the Prime Directive.
 PICARD / (nods; half-amused) That thought has passed thorugh my mind, Counselor.
 RIKER / What's this message from Starbase Fourteen?
 BEVERLY / It's showing infection rates, percentage illness increases... (looks up) The plague on Styris IV has flared up out of control.
 RIKER / Oh, no!
 GEORDI / (studying his own viewer) They're estimating deaths in the millions, sir.
 RIKER / (hits com control) Captain Picard, come in.
 TASHA / I know I could win. Not that I'd take her life, of course, but I'd be glad to embarrass her. The idea of accusing me...
 TROI / The plague?
 PICARD / If anything, worse than we heard.
 TASHA / Which means they desperately need the vaccine, sir. And I know I can win this challenge...
 PICARD / You do not have to prove anything here, Lieutenant.
 TROI / But the vaccine is important in this case, sir... ?
 PICARD / Counselor, I would consider you the last person to argue for Lieutenant Yar to accept that challenge.
 TROI / Betazoid blood is also practical, Captain. (indicates Tasha) The odds are very good she'd defeat Lutan's wife easily and you would win all the bargaining points you need.
 PICARD / "The odds are... ?"
 TROI / As you have pointed out yourself, we are all at risk every day of every mission.
 PICARD / I'll want some explanations from Lutan.
 TROI / But why not let him volunteer them, Captain? His needs for approval are immense. I'm sure if you found something you liked about him, he'd be anxious to agree with it.
 TASHA / (laughs) Yes, he would indeed. He's almost crippled with needs, the poor handsome dear.
 PICARD / I should tell you I do admire the hospitality you offer here, Lutan. A pity you began by abducting my security officer.
 LUTAN / I am in the grip of forces you do not understand.
 PICARD / (hesitates; nods) Some of it I do understand. She is a rather lovely female...
 LUTAN / You surprise me, Captain. What do you know of needs and feelings?
 PICARD / Nothing. (pretends to hesitate; smiles) Well, almost nothing in my position of ship's captain.
 HAGON / (chuckles) Aha, I see.
 PICARD / (smiles now) But it puzzles me; if you feel that way about Tasha, why have you challenged her to a fight to the death?
 LUTAN / Not I, Yareena! I am merely a spectator.
 PICARD / But you are also a man of great importance and wealth.
 HAGON / Great importance, perhaps...
 PICARD / Aha, I see. Then you too understand the proper value of women?
 LUTAN / We understand they are highly pleasant things... but after all, unimportant, except for the land they own.
 PICARD / You're a truly clever person, Lutan. You have nothing to lose either way the challenge goes.
 LUTAN / A code of honor, Captain, protects one like a magic cloak.
 PICARD / (a long pause; then) I will order Lieutenant Yar to fight. (rises) And may your cloak bring you all you deserve, Lutan.
 GEORDI / Come in.
 DATA / Why that razor, my friend? Why not the one I adjusted into perfect efficiency?
 GEORDI / Shaving is a human art form, Data. Technological perfection can shave too close.
 DATA / Puzzling. How can anything be too efficient?
 GEORDI / Tens of thousands of things. Maybe hundreds.
 DATA / (puzzles over it; then) We always go back to the human equation.
 GEORDI / Exactly. Have you kept working on it?
 DATA / Constantly, my friend. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (nods) Particularly human humor. For example, a man goes to a store to buy some kidneys. He says to the shopkeeper, "I'd like a pound of kiddillies, please." The shopkeeper says to him, "You mean kidneys, don't you?" The man says, "I said kiddillies, diddle I?"
 GEORDI / It's too old. And you didn't tell it very well.
 DATA / ... How do you know when something's funny?
 GEORDI / It's not explainable. You just do.
 DATA / Perhaps it is you, Geordi. Includling the kiddillies, I've learned six hundred sixty-two jokes, and you haven't...
 GEORDI / (still chuckling) "Includling the kiddillies!" Now that's funny.
 DATA / It was not meant as a joke! The tongue slipped!
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Commander Data, Lieutenant La Forge. Report to the Transporter Room for away party duty.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / First officer to captain. Ready with the away personnel.
 PICARD / (touches insignia) Lock in on this location.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Transporter locked in, sir.
 PICARD / Energize!
 PICARD / (continuing) You've both seen the message about the plague?
 GEORDI / (nods) And how badly the vaccine is needed. Yes sir.
 PICARD / We need to know as much as possible about Ligonian arms and armaments. Data, especially important will be an analysis of their combat capabilities. Geordi, concentrate on their cutting edges where applicable, durability, composition, weaknesses of material.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 DATA / From any particular point of view, sir?
 TROI / From the perspective of Lieutenant Yar's using them in combat with Lutan's wife.
 GEORDI / Are you... (begins again) You, you're serious, I can see that.
 DATA / Most interesting. (to Geordi) Could this be human joke number six hundred sixty-three?
 GEORDI / Negative, Data! It's a captain's order!
 DATA / Which makes it important to know... (indicates) ... which of these weapons are to be used.
 PICARD / That fact isn't known until the combat begins.
 PICARD / (continuing) You're right, Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, we could overwhelm this place easily. Take what we want.
 DATA / I may not understand human humor, sir, but I am a Starfleet Academy graduate.
 PICARD / Which means, of course...
 DATA / ... understanding the Prime Directive, sir.
 PICARD / Which is, unfortunately, what this is about. By our standards, the customs here and code of honor are the same kind of pompous, strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago. We evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own... (stops; shakes head ruefully) Sorry, that became a speech.
 TROI / You're the captain, sir. You're entitled...
 PICARD / (smiles) I am not entitled to bore you with what you already know. Carry on!
 RIKER (V.O.) / Ship's log, Commander William Riker reporting. Stardate 41235.4.
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) Continuing our appraisal of Ligonian technology. The Captain has made it clear...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... he wants Lieutenant Yar beamed immediately to safety if her life should become endangered... and I fervently hope the rules of that contest make it possible.
 RIKER / Riker to Transporter Room. Do you have our people on the sensors yet?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF (V.O.) / Their general area, sir. Visual on screen now.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF (V.O.) / (continuing) As you see, we're still doing some fine tuning.
 YAREENA / I agreed to this meeting, but I see no point to it. You have accepted the challenge; there is nothing further to say.
 TASHA / I think you should know that there is no physical training anywhere that matches Starfleet, especially its security people.
 YAREENA / And you should know that even though these contests are rare, we have a tradition of making ourselves capable of them.
 TASHA / Yareena, my acceptance had nothing to do with Lutan.
 YAREENA / It has everything to do with Lutan. Lutan wants you to be his First One.
 TASHA / Impossible, Yareena. I am a career Starfleet officer...
 YAREENA / How could you not love him? Every woman loves him!
 TASHA / Yareena, I fight for the vaccine... That's the truth.
 YAREENA / The truth is I will kill you if I can. And believe me, I can. There is nothing else to say.
 TASHA / In my world it's a greater honor to refuse to ...
 YAREENA / (interrupting) You are on our world!
 TROI / Captain, I'm your counselor. You brought me with you to Ligon to be of help.
 PICARD / Then help me, please. What is a way out of this?
 TROI / With the vaccine? (shakes head) None. Not under the rules we believe in.
 GEORDI / The weapons in that room are surprisingly durable and flexible... and deadly.
 DATA / And light, as if they're made for women to use.
 GEORDI / Some of them still have traces of blood -- and poison.
 PICARD / (reacting) Poison?
 GEORDI / Alkaloid base. Deadly.
 DATA / But we found no indication it is invariably used, sir. Or ever, in contests like this.
 PICARD / A theory, Data. What would be the best defense against weapons like these?
 DATA / Undiminished attack because of the possibility of poison, sir.
 PICARD / What about those lengths of metal in the yard outside?
 DATA / Uncertain, sir. However, joined together they would make a rectangle or square enclosing one hundred twenty-one square meters. If put end-to-end vertically, they would make a pole forty-four meters high, or two of twenty-two meters, or...
 PICARD / Thank you, Data.
 DATA / You are welcome, sir.
 TASHA / She won't budge. She loves him -- without reservation. (to them all) And she thinks I love him too.
 DATA / Most interesting. Do you?
 TASHA / Of course I don't, Data! As Troi pointed out to me, I'm attracted to him but that is entirely different.
 DATA / How so?
 PICARD / I'll agree it is puzzling, Data, but since it involves Tasha's very intimate and personal...
 TASHA / It involves nothing I'm ashamed of! (to Data) In fact, you may discover that the very worst move of your life was when you threw in with flesh and blood humans.
 DATA / (nodding gravely) But certainly the most interesting.
 TASHA / Interesting? Data, I grew up on a failed colony, completely lawless, mad, where people took what they wanted. This meant males for the reason they're bigger, stronger... (to Troi) And that's why I chose Starfleet security, I guess.
 TROI / (nods) For reasons you should be very proud of.
 TASHA / (to Data) Those were my early interests... strength, daring, dominant males... and that's why Lutan attracts me. To me, he's like a Federation Olympic Games hero. But do I want to become his so-called "First One," marry him? That would be nonsense!
 PICARD / Most interesting.
 DATA / (turning, nodding) Ah! You feel that also!
 PICARD / And having laid all that out, Lieut... (corrects self) Tasha... we come to a most serious question...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to captain.
 PICARD / Go ahead. We're alone.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We're fine tuned enough to see your hosts gathering in the open area outside with a number of them now headed for your location.
 PICARD / Thank you, Number One. (turning to Tasha) I was about to ask if considering that background, your apprehension by Lutan, all of that... do you still feel ready to undergo this challenge? Do you judge your condition good?
 TASHA / I judge it excellent, sir.
 HAGON / Your weapons, Lieutenant Yar. You may pick your size.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / Don't touch the spines! They're poisoned.
 GEORDI / If you're not careful you could kill yourself.
 TASHA / (looks at spines; shakes head) These I understand.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, supplemental. Captain Picard, faced with a critical need for a vaccine produced on this planet...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... has permitted Lieutenant Natasha Yar to engage in a fight to the death. I have yet to understand his reasoning or his plan.
 RIKER / Care to lend a hand?
 WESLEY / Yes sir!
 DATA / Was I seen leaving?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / (shakes head) They've got eyes only for the program.
 DATA / Captain Picard wanted no risk of our communications being overheard. You're to proceed now, as he indicated.
 BEVERLY / Captain's orders here, too.
 RIKER / (to Data) Does the Captain understand what you and Geordi reported about those weapons? They're razor sharp, split-second lethal...
 DATA / (nods) I am here to brief you on what he plans.
 TASHA / (to Picard) Any last minute instructions, sir?
 PICARD / (nods; then) Stay alive. We'll hope to do the rest.
 HAGON / I speak for Lutan. The rules are known; let combat continue until there is a victor. It will not be interrupted. (looks at combatants) Proceed.
 LUTAN / Combatants, hold your positions! (he turns to a guard) Return the weapon!
 HAGON / Yareena! Careful!
 RIKER / Move!
 TASHA / We're too late; she's growing cold.
 BEVERLY / Sorry that clashes with my instructions...
 TASHA / On no, no...
 PICARD / Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan? They fought to the death; you saw the final blow; you know the effects of your poison...
 LUTAN / But what of your Lieutenant Yar? She is to become my First One now.
 PICARD / I certainly won't stop her -- if she cares to claim that honor.
 HAGON / But remember, you now have all Yareena's lands and wealth, Lutan.
 LUTAN / (with a wry smile at Hagon) At least, all has not been lost.
 PICARD / Picard here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Since you've fulfilled your agreement, Captain, can we now beam the vaccine aboard?
 LUTAN / Ah, yes... of course.
 PICARD / No problem, Number One. Send down someone from medical.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / And to complete our business here, we are locked onto you.
 PICARD / Five to beam up. Energize.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, Stardate 41235.6. I am returning the conn to Captain Picard...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... as we begin loading the vaccine supply aboard. Shortly, we hope to signal "mission complete."
 RIKER / Welcome back, Captain, and you're wanted in the lounge.
 PICARD / (to his guests) This way, gentlemen.
 LUTAN / She is not dead! There was no death combat; you have violated our agreement. There will be no treaty, no vaccine... !
 PICARD / The challenge was carried out. She died, Lutan.
 LUTAN / There was no challenge! She is alive.
 BEVERLY / I am a physician and saw her die. If you doubt this poison, why not test it on yourself?
 PICARD / Lutan, we can provide you with the medical records to prove her death and how Doctor Crusher brought her back.
 YAREENA / And at the instant of death, Lutan, a mating agreement dissolves.
 LUTAN / But this is witchcraft, Yareena. To discard a mate in that manner...
 YAREENA / ... is less painful than the one you selected for me.
 LUTAN / No, Yareena...
 YAREENA / Even as I battled, Hagon, I heard you calling out for me.
 HAGON / Be my First One, Yareena.
 YAREENA / All my land, all my goods, all I have... is yours to rule.
 TASHA / That's so beautiful. (to Lutan) And so sad for you. You've lost everything.
 LUTAN / I have my honor.
 TASHA / It's such a... a waste!
 YAREENA / Do you want him?
 TASHA / No, there would be... complications.
 YAREENA / (to Lutan) Then I will have you as my Number Two. (indicates) Take your place accordingly.
 HAGON / As you see, Captain, you may excel in technology... but not in civilized behavior.
 PICARD / What the... ! (starts again) Ah yes, Wesley.
 RIKER / (overlap) Wesley! (quickly to Picard) He'd been manning that station for me. I forgot.
 PICARD / Well! (beat) Thank you again for manning one of our bridge stations. We'll see you get another chance.
 WESLEY / Yes sir!
 PICARD / What's the delay, Number One? Why aren't we warping out of here?
 RIKER / Set course for Styris IV, Warp three.
 GEORDI / Course laid in for Styris IV, sir.
 RIKER / Engage!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 41294.5. Our destination, the Class M Beta Cassius planet known simply as Haven. It is a world...
 PICARD sits alone in the Command Area. GEORDI is at the / Conn, WORF mans Ops, DATA's at Science Station #1.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... so renowned for its peaceful beauty that some believe it to have mystical healing powers.
 PICARD / Such a beautiful world. Legends say it has been known to mend souls and heal broken hearts.
 DATA / Legends which are totally unsupported by fact, Captain.
 PICARD / Legends like that are the spice of the universe, Mister Data, because they have a way of sometimes coming true.
 DATA / They have intrinsic value regardless of the facts, sir?
 PICARD / Facts are not everything, Mister Data.
 DATA / (startled by the thought) Indeed, sir.
 PICARD / Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Standard orbit, sir.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker. Your presence is requested in Transporter Room One.
 RIKER / Sorry ladies. Duty calls.
 RIKER / Lieutenant, you needed me?
 TASHA / Yes sir. There's an object of some kind beaming in from Haven.
 RIKER / What is it?
 TASHA / We're not sure. I'm holding it in stasis until we can register its exact nature. It's listed as a gift for Counselor Troi.
 RIKER / For Deanna? From here?
 TASHA / That's what I wondered about. She's on her way now.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / (indicating his viewer) Surface Station approval coming in now, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / Okay, let's bring it in.
 RIKER / Odd looking. Why would one of our people be getting a gift from this world?
 TROI / What's going on?
 TROI / No, oh NO... !
 TROI / (continuing) I don't believe this!
 RIKER / Counselor, what's this all about?
 TROI / (softly; slowly) They're bonding gifts... (pause) ... what you would call... wedding presents.
 RIKER / Wedding presents? What wedding? Who's getting married?
 TROI / (in shock) I am.
 TROI / I was certain it would never happen, Captain. The years I'd spend on this mission, the distance it has taken me away from home... (a deep breath) As you must have heard, genetic bonding is a Betazoid tradition.
 RIKER / But your father was human, Deanna. The Millers are human...
 TROI / You'd understand if you knew the loveliness of my world. The Millers and my father knew it, they loved Betazed so that they adopted the customs and traditions, including this one.
 PICARD / Will you and your husband be staying with the ship, Counselor?
 TROI / No, sir.
 PICARD / Then... I'll just say congratulations for now, Deanna. (including Riker) If you'll excuse me.
 TROI / Bill ... more than anything else in the world ... anything ... you want to be a starship captain. True?
 RIKER / (beat) I love you, Deanna.
 TROI / I can feel that. (nods; small smile) I know you love me... within those limits. (touches him) So almost more than anything else in the world, I want to honor my father's memory with this bonding.
 TROI / (continuing) Did you hear carefully what I said?
 RIKER / (nods sadly) Every word. (beat) I'm sorry.
 TROI / (nods) Come dance at my wedding.
 RIKER / I'll try.
 WORF / Message from planet Haven, Counselor. They wish to beam the Miller... (hesitates) ... ah, wedding party aboard.
 The Miller Family steps off the platform. STEVEN MILLER is a balding bear of a man in his late fifties. VICTORIA MILLER is small and slim, prim and proper. / Their son WYATT is a likeable, blond young man with an easy smile and an open, honest face.
 PICARD / I'm Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.
 STEVEN / Quite some starship you have here, captain. Look forward to this visit.
 VICTORIA / Oh, yes, yes. (looks to Troi) You couldn't be...
 TROI / ... I'm Deanna.
 VICTORIA / (dabbing her eyes) Deanna darling! You probably don't even remember me.
 STEVEN / Wyatt was absolutely right, Victoria. She is a beauty.
 WYATT / I'm Wyatt.
 VICTORIA / (to Picard) Isn't this simply beautiful? I knew romance was still alive somewhere.
 WYATT / I'd like you to have this. It's a Chameleon Rose. It changes color with the mood of its owner.
 TROI / It's wonderful. Thank you.
 STEVEN / (to Troi) Deanna, did you like the chest?
 TROI / Oh, yes. Especially the way It rolled its eyes at me.
 STEVEN / (to Victoria; exuberant) You see, Victoria? I told you she'd love it!
 VICTORIA / (to Picard and Troi) I was in favor of something more dignified. (looks at Steven critically) Steven picked the ugliest face imaginable.
 STEVEN / It was a fine face. Full of character!
 TROI / Excuse me, but... when is my mother arriving?
 WYATT / Your mother's still down on the planet, Deanna.
 TROI / Why?
 WYATT / Er -- is there a place for my parents to rest, Captain?
 STEVEN / We're not really tired, son, and besides I'd like to see some of the ship.
 VICTORIA / Steven, you know full well Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam aboard until we've cleared out. So...
 PICARD / You can visit your quarters now, if you wish.
 PICARD / (continuing) See the Millers to their accommodations, please. (to Steven) I'll join you all later.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / A Mrs. Troi ready to beam up, sir.
 PICARD / So be it.
 PICARD / (continuing) Wyatt seems a fine young man.
 TROI / (puzzled) Yes, he does... But I'm not what he expected.
 PICARD / I don't understand.
 TROI / Neither do I... but I'm definitely a surprise of some sort to him.
 TROI / (continuing) I should warn you. My mother's a bit... eccentric.
 MRS. TROI / (looks around) Where is everyone?
 TROI / Hello, Mother...
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / (turning to Troi) Don't say it... think it. Use your mind, not your mouth.
 TROI / Hello Mother.
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / Deanna. Shame! What has this life done to you?
 MRS. TROI / Don't tell me. You're the captain.
 PICARD / (smiling; nods) Of course. Your daughter explained your telepathic abilities.
 MRS. TROI / That wasn't telepathy, it was common sense. Who else would they send to greet me but the Captain? (indicates luggage item) You may carry my luggage.
 TROI / Mother!
 PICARD / No, no, quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother for the... the fine counselor she...
 TROI / Mother, it's quite inappropriate to ask the captain to...
 MRS. TROI / (to Picard) Yes, you do seem to be having difficulty. A man your age must work to keep himself in shape.
 TROI / I'm not going another step this way! (to Mother) A starship has its customs just as we do. Please set that down, Captain. (turning to Homn) If you're my mother's valet, then please valet!
 PICARD / Well, so long as you insist...
 MRS. TROI / I apologize for her behavior. (to Troi) Do you realize you've embarrassed your captain? (to Homn) Do as she says. Anything to avoid a quarrel on this occasion.
 TROI / Mother -- what happened to Xelo?
 MRS. TROI / I was forced to terminate his employment. (to Picard) Xelo was strongly attracted to me -- his thoughts became truly pornographic.
 PICARD / (to turbolift) Passenger accommodations.
 MRS. TROI / (to Captain) Of course the thoughts of Wyatt's father toward me were almost as vulgar...
 TROI / (pleading) Mother...
 MRS. TROI / (without pause) ... but he really doesn't have Mister Homn's imagination. Between that and his wife's inane chatter, it's a wonder I made it here at all. How do you like the Millers, Captain?
 PICARD / (startled; then) I'm sure I'll find them as pleasant as...
 MRS. TROI / As for me, I've found it shocking how they've changed in the years since my husband and I knew them. Or perhaps, I've just grown beyond them. You realize of course that with Betazoids, our ability to read the thoughts of others does see us grow and learn much faster than the typical dull and plodding human who...
 TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / Mother, that's enough!
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / So, you're not totally out of practice. Good. Very good.
 PICARD / We hope you'll be comfortable here.
 MRS. TROI / Yes, the room is adequate. Small, but adequate. You will of course adjust the temperature to a civilized level.
 PICARD / I'll see what I can do. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
 MRS. TROI / Yes Captain, you may go.
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / You've been slack, little one. Allowed your mental powers to rust.
 TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / To avoid becoming confused, mother. Humans constantly think one thing but say another.
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / Yes, they do, don't they. The poor dears. Our style of complete honesty frightens them.
 TROI / (switching to voice) On that subject Mother, there is such a thing as too much honesty with humans.
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / Nonsense. It sets them a good example. If they'd only say what they think instead of hiding it...
 TROI / But they're accustomed to hiding their thoughts...
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O. / And I quite understand what you faced here. An entire shipload of such inconsistency could drive one insane.
 MRS. TROI / Darling, I'm sorry this had to happen. Truly I am. But Steven Miller tracked me down and reminded me of the vows we made.
 TROI / (with difficulty) Mother... I'm having some trouble believing in those vows as I once did...
 MRS. TROI / Deanna!
 TROI / But... but I'll honor them, of course. I'm a Betazoid.
 MRS. TROI / And you may find Wyatt an unusual person. I've sensed remarkable depths in him.
 GEORDI / Message coming in from Haven, Sir.
 PICARD / On screen.
 VALEDA / I'm Valeda Innis, First Electorine of Haven. Captain Picard?
 PICARD / I'm Picard.
 VALEDA / (slight bow) Your presence honors us. And your timing is fortuitous, Captain.
 PICARD / How so?
 VALEDA / An incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate, violating our law. It has refused all attempts at communication.
 PICARD / Are you saying you believe it to be hostile?
 VALEDA / Failure to communicate is inherently hostile. (pause) We have no defensive capabilities here and our treaty specifies your obligations in that regard.
 PICARD / Agreed. But let's hope it doesn't become a defense matter.
 VALEDA / Of course, Captain. But I'm very happy we can count on you.
 WYATT / Come in.
 TROI / I wanted to apologize for my mother's behavior. I'm certain she was hard to bear on the trip over.
 WYATT / Your mother's honest -- I respect that.
 TROI / Yes, but she never lets up.
 WYATT / (grins) I'll admit, her honesty is a bit persistent.
 TROI / (nods) I've never heard it described better. But it is a Betazoid trait. (smiles) I'll try to be only half as annoying.
 WYATT / Let's see... what can I tell you about me? I'm a medical doctor, for whatever that's worth.
 TROI / "Doctor?" Where? How?
 WYATT / If you're picking up my thoughts, you'd know. Can't you do that at all?
 TROI / Yes... This could be what mother felt about you. I believe we could read each other eventually.
 WYATT / Can I take that as a compliment?
 TROI / (smiles) Absolutely. I've only felt this with... well, with someone who's on this ship.
 WYATT / Oh? Do I have competition?
 TROI / No. All he wants is to captain a starship.
 WYATT / What I want is to... well, to do another kind of brave and noble thing... which you may find prosaic. What I want is to cure people.
 TROI / Well, since I am a practicing psychologist, maybe we can work in concert. We are going to be together a long time.
 WYATT / Yes. That's the point of marriage, I suppose.
 TROI / I really thought you'd tell me you were an artist.
 TROI / (continuing) I just felt your mind very much on those. And they are your work, aren't they?
 WYATT / Yes. (faint smile) And I can see it'll be very hard to keep secrets from you.
 TROI / This is why you were surprised when you first saw me. (indicating) This woman... you thought that I would be this woman.
 WYATT / (with difficulty) I've seen this face since I was a boy. When I closed my eyes at night, I could hear her whispering my name. (pause) Knowing you were Betazoid, I assumed it was you, projecting yourself into my mind.
 TROI / I'm sorry I'm not what you hoped for...
 WYATT / No. Please don't mistake a childish fantasy for disappointment. You're so beautiful, I-- I feel honored.
 TROI / You have no idea who she is?
 WYATT / No. And it really doesn't matter now.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's personal log. I trust my concern over the problems of ship's Counselor Troi are not based merely on the fact of losing a highly valuable crew member. Actually...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... it seems to me that she has become trapped by a custom of her home world which the facts of the twenty-fourth century have made unwise and unworkable. I wish I could intervene.
 DATA (V.O.) / On the viewer, Captain...
 DATA / Unidentified vessel. Traveling sub-warp speed, bearing two-three- five, mark seven.
 PICARD / Sub-warp? It's several hours away then? (to Worf) Let's take a look at it. Enlarge to maximum.
 WORF / Increasing magnification, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data! Am I seeing the trouble I believe is there?
 DATA / If you mean a Tarellian vessel, you are, sir.
 RIKER / I thought the Tarellians were finished! What are the poor devils doing here?
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher to the Bridge, urgent! (to Riker) There's no way I'll permit them to destroy us. And the treaty here forces us to protect this world too.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. It has been believed the Tarellian race was extinct, an assumption contradicted now by the sight of one of their vessels...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... approaching Haven.
 RIKER / The fact it is traveling at its present velocity suggests an answer.
 GEORDI / A damaged vessel, sir? That could explain it.
 RIKER / (nods) If it were unable to reach warp speed, it would have taken all these years to get here.
 PICARD / (nods) Continue with the briefing, Mister Data.
 DATA / Class M world, much like your Earth world, very similar humanoid life form, which faced the unfortunate old story of their hatreds outrunning their intelligence.
 PICARD / Hostilites between the two land masses?
 DATA / (nods) Ending with one of them... it doesn't really matter which... unleashing a deadly biological weapon on the other.
 BEVERLY / (glumly) And naturally the other also became infected in the end... (shaking head) It makes one question the intelligence of humanoid forms.
 PICARD / Are you acquainted with the facts of the infection, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (nods) They had reached Earth's late-twentieth century, early twenty-first century level. Which was all that's needed if you're a damned fool. A highly deadly, extra-infectious virus... which at that modest level of knowledge, is not that difficult to grow.
 TASHA / (nods) We learned the rest of the story in security training. Some Tarellians made it to other worlds only to die along with the populations they infected.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) It's pretty well covered in Academy training now, Captain. (to the others) Many of them tried to avoid other inhabited worlds as they escaped... only to be hunted down and destroyed anyway.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, we had believed the last Tarellian vessel was destroyed eight years ago by the Alcyones. (to Data) Exactly when will they reach Haven?
 DATA / Exactly thirteen hours, nine minutes, twenty-one...
 PICARD / (interrupting; to all) Which will create a very difficult problem for the Enterprise at that time. Our treaty here requires us to protect Haven from alien threats ... and a plague ship certainly qualifies as that. But Federation policy requires us to assist life forms in need ... which qualifies the Tarellians too. I'll want you to help me find some answers by then.
 PICARD / (continuing) All of which gives ample time for your second assignment. Or you may prefer it on a volunteer basis. (beat; then smiles to Troi) The pre-joining dinner of Counselor Deanna Troi will proceed as planned.
 VICTORIA / We've talked it over, Captain. We'd like you to perform the ceremony.
 PICARD / I'd be honored, Mrs. Miller.
 MRS. TROI / Impossible. The captain is not practiced in the ways of Betazed joining.
 VICTORIA / This will be a traditional Earth ceremony!
 MRS. TROI / I'm sorry, but it proceeds out of a Betazed bonding.
 VICTORIA / And I am sorry, Lwaxana, but my family and I are living on Earth now...
 MRS. TROI / So that's why you want that barbaric ritual. (to Picard) Terrible, Captain, to see a woman go downhill like this...
 TROI / Mother!
 VICTORIA / Downhill?!
 MRS. TROI / The human ritual is out of the question!
 VICTORIA / Who are you to tell us what's out of the question?
 MRS. TROI / (cool, superior) Your ignorance is astonishing. I am Lwaxana Troi: Daughter of The Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx, Heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed. (pause; insultingly) Who are you?
 PICARD / Excuse me, everyone, but dinner is served... (to the mothers; smiling) ... and by Starfleet tradition, all disputes and disagreements are thereby resolved.
 VICTORIA / (moving off) In who's favor?
 PICARD / The captain's.
 MRS. TROI / That's not what you're thinking.
 PICARD / Captains are not required to think.
 PICARD / (raising glass) A toast. To the young couple and their families. May this union be a happy and productive one.
 WYATT / Is it true, Captain -- that there's a Tarellian ship, headed for Haven?
 PICARD / Yes, it's true.
 WYATT / That's amazing! I've read everything I could about them. Biological virus analysis was a favorite subject at medical school.
 BEVERLY / In which case, I'd very much like to meet with you, sir. I'm pleased to have a medical colleague aboard.
 WYATT / (distracted by the bell) Yes, ma'am... Uh, Doctor? Would it be possible to prepare some medical supplies, geared toward the Tarellian's probable needs? We could beam it over without any fear of infection.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) What do you think, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / I think it's a considerate idea. (to Wyatt) Sickbay's at your disposal, Doctor.
 WYATT / Thank you.
 VICTORIA / (to Homn) Must you do that?
 MRS. TROI / (never looking up from food) As you well know, it is the Betazed way of giving thanks for the food we eat.
 VICTORIA / (amused) You? Giving thanks? Besides, you never did this before.
 MRS. TROI / I do it now. Unlike some people, I am in growth.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) Victoria, I've forgotten whether you enjoy pets or not.
 VICTORIA / Love them, of course.
 MRS. TROI / Gently... gently! (retrieves vine) I thought you said you enjoyed pets.
 RIKER / Captain... If I may be excused... (lamely) ... to spend some time considering the Tarellian situation...
 PICARD / Of course.
 RIKER / (rises; slight bow) Ladies and Gentlemen.
 MRS. TROI / (quietly) Why didn't he mention you?
 DATA / Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested in the Betazed ceremony you mentioned. Could you tell us more?
 MRS. TROI / I'd be delighted, Commander. It is an ancient ceremony, widely regarded as the most beautiful in the universe.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) After the young couple remove their clothing --
 TASHA / The Bride and Groom go naked?!
 MRS. TROI / No. You misunderstand.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) All guests must go unclothed. This honors the act of love being celebrated...
 MRS. TROI / (continuing; to Victoria) Don't worry too much, dear. Your body's not that bad.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) Besides, your husband quite likes the idea of seeing me unclothed.
 VICTORIA / Steven!!
 MRS. TROI / You did know he's attracted to me, didn't you?
 STEVEN / Untrue! I don't.... Not really...
 TROI / (rising; angrily) Stop it, all of you -- (to her mother) Especially you!
 MRS. TROI / (turning to Picard) Captain, as you requested, I have carefully avoided disagreements during this. But did you wish me to ignore what my senses tell me?
 DATA / (pleasant; to Parents) Could you please continue your bickering? I find it intriguing.
 TROI / Why did you order up a desert?
 RIKER / It matches my mood. Empty.
 TROI / Yes. It does.
 RIKER / I lost you once before, and now I've lost you again.
 TROI / Are you certain exactly who lost who, Imzadi?
 RIKER / Don't use that word now, Deanna...
 TROI / It means 'my beloved.'
 RIKER / It also suggests the same feeling will go on ... tomorrow, and tomorrow...
 TROI / (nods) It suggests a kind of bonding ... an agreement...
 TROI / (continuing) As I said ... I understand.
 RIKER / Do you? Really? (turns; moves close) Imzadi... yes, you are my beloved. Today. But I can't lie to you and say I'm certain about tomorrow ... and tomorrow ... I can't guarantee it will be something you can share. (moves close to a kiss) Because you are my Imzadi, I refuse to promise you a future I can't yet see.
 TROI / How... would an Earth woman react to that, Bill?
 RIKER / To an Earth woman, I'd lie. (faint smile) But you'd know it if I did.
 WYATT (V.O.) / Hello you two!
 RIKER / Next!
 WYATT / (excited) This is incredible. I've heard about this, but I never imagined...
 WYATT / (continuing) I respected what you did tonight...
 TROI / I lost my temper.
 WYATT / It worked. You shamed them into compromise. After you left it really calmed down. (he laughs) The Joining will be half-Betazed, half-Old Earth. The Captain'll do the ceremony and Mister Homn will be my best man.
 TROI / And we'll take our clothes half off?
 WYATT / Some of us all. You do... I do... Your mother, my father. (smiles) But not my mother.
 TROI / How did you manage that?
 WYATT / I didn't. Your mother did.
 WYATT / (continuing) And I just caught my father, practicing naked in front of his mirror.
 WYATT / And so... A question I should have asked before. (takes her shoulders; turns her to him) Deanna... do you really want to go through with this?
 TROI / (beat) Yes. I want to.
 WYATT / I'm a very lucky man.
 PICARD / Captain's log, supplemental. All attempts at warning off the Tarellian ship have failed. They still refuse to communicate and I am growing concerned.
 PICARD / How can you be certain they're receiving us?
 DATA / Because our sensors are showing a responder echo, sir, on the frequency they once used.
 GEORDI / Message coming in from Haven.
 PICARD / Viewer on.
 VALEDA / (on screen) Captain, the plague ship is approaching transport range.
 PICARD / We're aware of that, Electorine.
 VALEDA / You realize they can turn this lovely world of ours into a graveyard? Please take action, now, before it's too late.
 RIKER / We'll take action in a few moments.
 VALEDA / Please... please destroy them now!
 PICARD / We will not fire on them, Electorine.
 TASHA / I'm certain I could disable their ship with a phaser burst, Captain.
 PICARD / And then?
 WYATT / Almost complete, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / You show a remarkable knowledge of viral immunology, Wyatt.
 WYATT / It's a striking design, don't you think?
 WYATT / (continuing) They built it underwater. At a base, three miles below sea-level.
 BEVERLY / Oh? How did you know that?
 WYATT / I don't know... I must have heard it somewhere.
 DATA / They're coming within transporter range, sir.
 PICARD / Can't delay any longer, then. Ready the tractor beam, Lieutenant Yar. Target ship and activate on my command.
 TASHA / Tractor beam ready.
 RIKER / Let's hope it buys some communication.
 PICARD / Engage.
 TASHA / Got them, sir...
 PICARD / Do we have them securely, Worf? Can they beam out to the planet?
 WORF / Negative, sir. They can't leave that ship.
 GEORDI / I know they're receiving us, sir. And at this distance they could reply with their running lights if necessary.
 DATA / Unless they have all died. Their ship could have been brought in by automation.
 RIKER / (indicating) Captain! The viewer... !
 TROI / It's the woman in Wyatt's painting!
 PICARD'S (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 41294.7 orbiting Haven with the Tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam. Question: What strange combination...
 PICARD'S (V.O.) / (continuing) ... of circumstances has caused a woman out of someone's imagination to appear on the plague ship?
 GEORDI / Enterprise to Tarellian vessel, are you receiving us?
 WRENN / My name is Wrenn... and before I inquire why you've trapped us here, is there one aboard your vessel named Wyatt?
 PICARD / Your business is with me, sir. I am Captain Picard, commanding this starship.
 WYATT / Captain, I don't understand...
 WRENN / I can't believe this! Ariana was right! (moving to the side) He is there, daughter!
 WYATT / What's happening? Except for dream images, I've never seen her.
 TROI / I'm not sure but perhaps mother would...
 PICARD / (interrupting; to Wrenn) Our first order of business, sir, is with the threat your vessel poses to the planet below. If you still carry the infection which destroyed your world...
 WRENN / Oh, we still carry it, Captain. My daughter, I, all eight of us.
 PICARD / Eight?
 WRENN / (indicates) All of us that are left, Captain.
 WRENN / (continuing) Most of the rest passed on during the years it took to reach Haven.
 PICARD / Sir... if you've come here because of the legend about planet Haven miraculously healing the sick...
 WRENN / No, no. We've learned to face the truth about such things. But Haven is a remarkably lovely and pleasant place, is it not? All we want is a resting place until the last of us are gone.
 PICARD / I'm... sorry, but circumstances make it impossible for us to allow you to beam down to Haven.
 WRENN / We do not ask to make contact with those living below. All we ask is to be on the edge of some sea, some unpopulated island or faraway peninsula...
 PICARD / This is not our planet, sir. I'll be happy to present your needs to those who govern this world...
 WRENN / Present the fact we intend to die here, Captain. And if we die while caged by your tractor beam, so be it.
 MRS. TROI / Isn't this combination exciting? But I can't wear it, of course, since your father would be devastated if I weren't naked.
 WYATT / Mrs. Troi, may I talk to you about something serious?
 MRS. TROI / I am always serious, dear boy. Only my pleasant nature makes it appear otherwise.
 WYATT / Please, Mrs. Troi.
 MRS. TROI / Yes, that was puzzling. A woman out of another place who insists she knows you.
 WYATT / And...
 MRS. TROI / (interrupts, nodding) And whom you've dreamed of for all these years.
 WYATT / And I hoped that with you handling thoughts the way you do...
 MRS. TROI / Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily your thoughts come through. I wonder if it is because you were raised on Betazed? (smiles) Well, no matter, I can see you were wrong for my daughter anyway.
 WYATT / Ma'am?
 MRS. TROI / The answer to the puzzle of Ariana and you is too simple for most humans to understand.
 WYATT / Too simple?
 MRS. TROI / Of course. It's something they all know instinctively but go to great effort to reject or to build complicated superstitions about it. All life, Wyatt, all consciousness, wherever or whenever it occurs... is indissolvably bound together. Indeed, it is all part of the same thing.
 WYATT / (startled; considers it) Yes! I have wondered if something like that...
 MRS. TROI / (carrying on his thought) ... weren't so. And no doubt so has Ariana, which helped the two of you to make contact. (touching neck jewelry) Shall I wear the light or deep ruby stones? Which would be best for me, naked?
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) Wyatt, don't puzzle on it so much! It was just a simple thought!
 BEVERLY / Wyatt, are you feeling all right?
 WYATT / The supplies are ready. I'll take them to the transporter room.
 BEVERLY / I'll notify the captain they're ready.
 VICTORIA / (indicates Steven) Look at your father, Wyatt. He just can't wait to strip off his clothes in that barbaric ceremony.
 STEVEN / (overhearing) We had to compromise. As usual, I'm making the sacrifice.
 WYATT (V.O.) / You look beautiful.
 WYATT / But you looked best of all in the desert on the Holodeck. (moves in) When you did this...
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / You can put the supplies on the pad. (points; looks down) Doctor Crusher had me set the coordinates. All we need is the captain's order --
 GEORDI / Captain! Someone's transporting to the Tarellian ship.
 PICARD / Override!
 GEORDI / (after pause) I can't sir. It's too late.
 WRENN / Hello, Wyatt. We always thought you were a dream.
 WYATT / You're not surprised. Did you know I'd beam over?
 WRENN / Once we saw you were real, we knew. You are a doctor?
 WYATT / Yes. (indicates) I've brought medicines and supplies. I'll do what I can to help.
 VICTORIA / (to Picard) How could you let this happen? My son, surrounded by those horrible lepers!
 PICARD / Mrs. Miller, if I could have prevented this...
 VICTORIA / Then beam him back!
 TROI / He can never come back, Mrs. Miller.
 WRENN / You may turn off your tractor beam, Captain. We will not be going to Haven.
 VICTORIA / Wyatt!
 WYATT / Mother...Father... Forgive me, but I must... I'm going to try to cure these people.
 WYATT / I knew I was coming to Haven to meet my destiny. I thought it was to be with you, Deanna. But it was Ariana who drew me here. I'm sorry.
 TROI / Wyatt, I'm happy for you. Ariana, I love you both.
 MRS. TROI / (softly) You've done surprisingly well for a human, Wyatt.
 TROI / Mother...
 WYATT / I take that as a compliment, Deanna.
 WRENN / (to Picard) My respects, Captain.
 PICARD / And mine, sir.
 TROI / (whispering) Good-bye.
 STEVEN / (pleasantly) Keep the chest. You'll have use for it some day.
 MRS. TROI / Seems such a shame to waste that lovely wedding dress. Perhaps I should stay and be Joined to a new mate.
 TROI / What??
 MRS. TROI / The captain is highly attracted to me, but he's a little too old.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing; to Riker) Perhaps I should choose you.
 TROI / (sharply) He has other obligations, Mother!
 MRS. TROI / -- Very well. It's his loss. Mister Homn!
 MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V. O. / Try and remember your heritage, little one. (spoken) You may energize.
 MRS. TROI / Captain! Even Xelo never had such thoughts about me.
 TROI / That was meant as a joke, Captain.
 PICARD / But she has claimed to be so completely honest.
 TROI / (nods) Except when a lie is more amusing. Weren't you amused?
 PICARD / (firmly) I was not!
 PICARD / Take us out of here, Mister Riker.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. (to Geordi) Warp two, helm, heading five-seven mark three-one-nine.
 GEORDI / Warp two, five-seven mark three-one-nine.
 RIKER / Engage!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 41263.1. We have rendezvoused with the USS Fearless from which...
 which INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER. PICARD is in his Command Chair. COMMANDER RIKER is to his right. COUNSELOR TROI to his left. SECURITY CHIEF LIEUTENANT YAR is at / the Tactical Station. Behind her at the Aft Station is LIEUTENANT WORF. LIEUTENANT GEORDI LA FORGE has the Conn, LIEUTENANT COMMANDER DATA is at the Ops Station.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... a Starfleet propulsion expert and his assistant are beaming over to conduct tests on the Enterprise's warp drive engines.
 PICARD / I don't understand your concern, Number One. They're not authorized to make any alterations in our engines. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (glancing at command viewer) According to Starfleet's message, they will simply test different ways of entering warp speed and different intermix formulas. What's the harm in that?
 RIKER / It's the specs that Kosinski sent us. In my opinion, sir, they're gibberish.
 PICARD / Gibberish?
 RIKER / Mister Data, will you explain?
 DATA / (turns to Picard) Sir, we put Mister Kosinski's specs into the computer and ran a controlled test on them. There was no improvement in engine performance.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Then explain Starfleet's report how the same tests on the USS Ajax... (indicates main viewer) ... and then on the Fearless over there, resulted in a measurable increase in propulsion.
 RIKER / Our engines are new, sir, top condition. The tests on those older ships may have simply straightened out some engine inefficiency.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Bridge from Transporter Chief. Two from USS Fearless are ready to beam over.
 PICARD / (to Com) Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way. (to Riker) Obviously, something does worry you about these tests.
 RIKER / Yes, sir. And if you don't mind... (stands; indicates) ... I'll ask Counselor Troi to look these visitors over.
 As TRANSPORTER EFFECT MATERIALIZES the Visitors. KOSINSKI has the look of someone operating at top / performance. His ASSISTANT, a humanoid alien, is small, physically non-threatening, with a way of allowing himself to blend into the background in a shy, good-natured way. Kosinski dominates the room. He's obsessed with himself and what he does. His manner is arrogant, his demeanor authoritarian; he pulls every eye toward him.
 RIKER / Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski. I'm the first officer, Commander William Riker. This is...
 KOSINSKI / Where is the captain, please?
 RIKER / (trying to be pleasant) He is engaged in other duties, sir...
 KOSINSKI / A ship's engines should be a concern of the ship's captain...
 RIKER / They are, sir. Which is why they make their first officers directly responsible for engine condition and performance. (indicating Argyle) Guided, of course, by one of our chief engineers, Lieutenant Commander Argyle in this case.
 ARGYLE / (to Kosinski) A pleasure, sir. I appreciated receiving the advance specs...
 KOSINSKI / On which you have no end of questions?
 ARGYLE / (a beat) Aye, I have.
 RIKER / (to assistant) And you, sir, are listed as...as...
 ASSISTANT / (gentle voiced) As Mister Kosinski's assistant. My actual name is unpronounceable by humans...
 RIKER / From Tau Alpha C. That's very distant...
 KOSINSKI / ... All approved and described in the Starfleet communications. Now... (heads for door) ... I'd like to set up in the Engine Room immediately...
 RIKER / Our chief engineer will show you to his Engine Room.
 KOSINSKI / No need -- I know my way around starships...
 RIKER / One thing Kosinski isn't hiding. (at Troi's look) A bad disposition.
 TROI / (nods) Agreed... Also, he's arrogant, overbearing, self-important. (non-critical tone) And very sure of himself and his ability.
 RIKER / (considers this; then) And the other one -- his assistant?
 TROI / He's the puzzle. (takes a minute to phrase it) With most life forms I feel something. I may not be able to interpret or understand it, but I feel something, if only a presence. With him -- nothing. Empty space. It was as though he isn't even here. (seeks words for it) ... Something about this concerns me. I don't know what, I can't point out a reason... yet.
 RIKER / Stay concerned. Please! The safety of the Enterprise may be entrusted to those two!
 KOSINSKI / Inform the bridge I shall begin the first test in precisely fifty minutes. Why is that child here?
 ARGYLE / (throws off the answer) He's working on a school project. (that's not what's on his mind) Before you continue, there are some questions. First, tell us...
 KOSINSKI / (interrupting) ... To save myself time, let me ask those questions for you.
 KOSINSKI / (continuing) You received the information which Starfleet provided -- you fed it into your computer -- being as precise as humanly possible -- then you ran a controlled test. And, then, to your astonishment -- nothing happened.
 KOSINSKI / So you said - "What's going on? This doesn't work. Kosinski's a fraud."
 KOSINSKI / (smiles smugly) You see, I have had this discussion on other Starfleet vessels. They didn't understand it; why should you?
 ARGYLE / You are surely not saying it's unexplainable?
 KOSINSKI / I'm saying I'm not a teacher, and don't want to become one. I have neither the inclination nor time.
 RIKER / You have all the time you need.
 KOSINSKI / I don't think you understand. This has already been approved by Starfleet Command.
 RIKER / But it hasn't been approved by the chief engineer... or by me.
 KOSINSKI / (a little snidely) I didn't know that was necessary.
 RIKER / Now you do.
 KOSINSKI / Perhaps I should talk with Captain Picard.
 RIKER / If you like, but it won't change anything.
 KOSINSKI / How basic shall I be?
 RIKER / I leave that to you.
 KOSINSKI / We can save a little time this way. My assistant is laying in my base formulas a bit more rapidly than a human can do it... (small chuckle) ... even myself.
 KOSINSKI / Here is, in the simplest possible terms, what I do. This warp drive system was tuned only in the grossest sense, at least to my standard anyway. What I do is specific.
 KOSINSKI / (continuing) How should I say this? (finds the words) Aah... sufficient to say for now, these symbols and their relationships have greater meaning to me than to you...
 KOSINSKI / (continuing) ... although you can in time learn them. Then, those of you sufficiently gifted, can duplicate my results.
 RIKER / But the three percent efficiency increase of the other vessels could still have been caused by other things such as simply working more carefully, better station coordination...
 ARGYLE / And you mention "gifted." In what way? Whatever any of us can learn to do on a computer, another computer can eventually perform faster, more precisely...
 KOSINSKI / Wrong! What the computer can't do is create. Only the mind... (taps his forehead) ... is capable of true, original thought.
 RIKER / But what we're dealing with is mechanics. However complex it may be, it has to do with an engine.
 KOSINSKI / And that is exactly where you go wrong. Warp drive has become so complex that it is...
 KOSINSKI / ... as filled with mysteries as nature itself. (indicates) If you'll view the screen with me and consider the following.
 KOSINSKI / Is this merely "mechanics" or is it nature that we deal with in this? What else than nature are elementals like space and time?
 KOSINSKI / Boy, don't play with that.
 WORF / Main Engineering is ready to proceed, Captain.
 PICARD / Engineering, this is the bridge. It's your call.
 KOSINSKI / Do this one just like the others. Nothing changes.
 KOSINSKI / (continuing) Commander -- I will make my preliminary adjustments at warp one-point-five, and complete them as we achieve warp six.
 RIKER / Engineering to bridge, did you copy that?
 PICARD / Affirmative, Number One. Are you ready?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We are.
 PICARD / La Forge, set in warp one-point-five.
 GEORDI / Warp one-point-five.
 PICARD / Engage!
 KOSINSKI / All right, here we go.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Passing warp five.
 KOSINSKI / (with a little panic) What are you doing... ?
 PICARD / What is our velocity?
 DATA / It is off the scale, sir...
 PICARD / Reverse engines!
 DATA / Captain, no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity.
 PICARD / That's because no one has ever gone this fast. REVERSE ENGINES!
 PICARD / All stop!
 PICARD / Position.
 GEORDI / Calculating it, sir. (shaken) Data, what do you read there?
 DATA / (reading his own viewer; puzzled) A malfunction... I trust.
 PICARD / (snaps) Position please, Lieutenant La Forge.
 GEORDI / According to these readings, sir, we have not only left our own galaxy, but have passed through two others, stopping on the far side of Triangulum -- the Galaxy known as M-Thirty-Three.
 PICARD / That's not possible. Data, what is our distance traveled?
 DATA / Two million -- seven hundred thousand light years.
 PICARD / (more to himself than anyone else) I can't accept that.
 DATA / You must, sir. Our comparisons show it to be completely accurate.
 GEORDI / And I calculate that at maximum warp, sir... (looks up from viewer) ... it would take over three hundred years to get home.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41263.2. This will be a rather unusual log entry, assuming Starfleet ever receives it. As I have already informed my crew...
 PICARD (V.O. / (continuing) ... a phenomenal surge of power during a warp speed experiment has sent our starship hurtling out of our own galaxy, past another, taking us over two million, seven-hundred thousand light years in a few minutes.
 GEORDI / Message on this has been transmitted to Starfleet, sir.
 DATA / Which, traveling subspace, they should receive in fifty-one years, ten months...
 PICARD / (interrupting; irritated) Mister Data... !
 DATA / Sir?
 KOSINSKI / Captain Picard, I presume?
 RIKER / We're still trying to determine what happened, sir.
 KOSINSKI / The truth is, Captain, I made a mistake. A wonderful, incredible mistake.
 PICARD / (hard) Just explain what brought us here!
 KOSINSKI / As the power built, I applied the energy asymtotically. I anticipated some tiling, but it didn't occur. That was my error -- using Bessel functions from the beginning.
 PICARD / (beat) What is he saying, Number One?
 RIKER / (hesitates; embarrassed) Well... if you want the truth, sir, it sounds to me like nonsense. But considering...
 PICARD / But considering where we are, we must assume it isn't.
 WESLEY / I can call my mother. She's a doctor...
 ASSISTANT / No, there's nothing she can do. I need to rest. I've been away too long.
 WESLEY / Whatever happened to you... was it part of what happened to the ship?
 ASSISTANT / Please believe I mean no harm to this vessel... or those in it...
 WESLEY / Is Mister Kosinski like he sounds? A joke?
 ASSISTANT / No, that's too cruel. He has sensed some small part of this...
 WESLEY / (slowly) ... that space and time and thought aren't... well, aren't the separate things they seem to be?
 WESLEY / I... I just thought the formula you were using said something like that...
 ASSISTANT / Boy, don't you ever say that again. At least, not at your age in a world that's not ready for such... (considers it) ... such dangerous nonsense.
 KOSINSKI / I've always suspected this rate of speed was possible, of course, but, at this level -- never. We are going to need new definitions. New parameters.
 ARGYLE / Perhaps you could call it the Kosinski scale.
 KOSINSKI / Why not? Since I'm the one who has made the so-called "warp barrier" meaningless. (to Picard) And, Captain, this must be a special thrill for you.
 PICARD / "Thrill?"
 KOSINSKI / (nods) As an explorer. In three centuries of space flight, we have charted just eleven percent of our galaxy. Then... (gestures broadly) ... voila, we accomplish this.
 PICARD / (hesitant nod) Yes... but isn't the real point, can you do it again? Can you get us home?
 KOSINSKI / Of course I can. I'll just do what I did before. (moves for turbolift; looks back) Coming, Riker?
 PICARD / Commander Riker will join you in a moment.
 PICARD / Comment is invited. Counselor?
 TROI / He's convinced he's right -- I have no doubt of that.
 WORF / Can you allow a man who has made one mistake back into a position where he may make another?
 GEORDI / What are the options? If he doesn't do it, who will?
 DATA / Captain, we are here. Why not avail ourselves of this opportunity for study? There is a giant protostar here in the process of forming. No vessel has been out this far.
 PICARD / (smiles at Data) Spoken like a true Starfleet graduate. (nods) It is tempting, eh Number One?
 RIKER / Aye, sir, it is. (nods to Picard) As they say, sir... you're the captain.
 PICARD / Yes, that's the problem. I know that if Kosinski can get us home, Starfleet could use his technique to send back a pure science vessel to do even more. (turning) Number One -- have Mister Kosinski prepare to get us out of here.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 KOSINSKI / (self-satisfied) Do you realize that many great advancements of mankind have been tied to speed? This is a moment in history -- right now. Right here. And your names will be linked forever with mine.
 WESLEY / Excuse me, Commander Riker. I don't think he did it... I think it was...
 RIKER / (gently but firmly) Not now, Wes.
 WESLEY / But, when this all happened, I was watching his assistant and...
 RIKER / I'm sure it was fascinating, Wesley, and I look forward to hearing about it. But not right now!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Standing by, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 KOSINSKI / Come on.
 WESLEY / He's too tired. (with a little challenge) Why don't you do it by yourself?
 KOSINSKI / Yes, why not?
 ASSISTANT / (rising) No, I will help.
 KOSINSKI / As you wish.
 GEORDI / I've laid in a reciprocal course back, Captain.
 KOSINSKI / You may tell the captain I am ready, First Officer.
 RIKER / Ready for you to engage, Captain.
 PICARD / Warp one-point-five.
 GEORDI / Warp one-point-five.
 KOSINSKI / (panic rising) It's not working...
 PICARD / ALL STOP!
 GEORDI / Answering all stop.
 DATA / Captain, according to the instruments, our speed never exceeded warp one-point-five.
 GEORDI / All stopped, Captain.
 PICARD / Yes, but where is this place?
 DATA / Where none have gone before.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log Stardate 41263.3. Instead of returning to our own galaxy...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... the Enterprise has gone forward to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our ship's instruments...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... have continued to operate, our motion and course sensors reveal what would ordinarily be considered impossible... (pause) ... but this is very real... our present position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy.
 PICARD / Data, you have the helm. I'll be in Engineering.
 PICARD / (continuing) Main Engineering.
 TROI / What is it?
 DATA / A Klingon Targ!
 WORF / From home, my pet... (pulls back; puzzled) ... but when I was a child!
 TASHA / You're telling us that's a kittycat?
 WORF / Yes, I suppose that's what you...
 TASHA / You darling, what are you doing here?
 TASHA / Now, run. This isn't a safe place at all.
 GEORDI / What's wrong, Tasha? You look frightened to death.
 TASHA / I.. I was at... (shakes head) This is crazy! I was at the colony where I grew up ... being chased by a rape gang...
 PICARD / (halting the pair) How? What is troubling you?
 PICARD / Maman.
 PICARD / Maman... this can't be! You've been...
 PICARD / Strange, but... yes, I've felt that. But why now...suddenly...
 PICARD / We... we believed it the outer rim.
 PICARD / (moves in; intent) Do you understand these things, Maman?
 PICARD / Maman, can you tell me where my ship is? What is this place?
 RIKER / Captain, you were reported headed for...
 PICARD / (whirls; snaps) Just a moment, Number One!
 RIKER / Can I help you, sir?
 PICARD / (beat) No... no, let's help all of us.
 PICARD / General Quarters, Red Alert!
 RIKER / What is it Captain? Why are we at General Quarters?
 PICARD / I had to get everyone's attention. This was the quickest way.
 PICARD / (to the ship's company) This is the captain. This is not a drill. It seems that in this place, the physical universe and ... and the world of ideas are intermixed. What we think also becomes real. Therefore, we must, repeat MUST begin controlling our thoughts.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We will report all this to you more fully as our understanding increases. The Enterprise will stay at full alert until this crisis is solved.
 PICARD / What did you do?
 RIKER / It wasn't him. It never was. It was his assistant.
 PICARD / What are you talking about?
 RIKER / Kosinski wasn't the one controlling the warp experiment.
 KOSINSKI / It was me!
 RIKER / (to Picard) The equations he punched in were nonsense, just as we thought.
 KOSINSKI / (almost in tears; to Riker) I honestly thought it was me. I thought somehow... somehow that I was operating on his level.
 ARGYLE / It's also my fault, Captain. I should have realized it wasn't Kosinski.
 PICARD / How could you? How could anyone... ?
 RIKER / Wesley did.
 PICARD / (whirls to Wesley) If you knew something, why didn't you say so?!
 RIKER / He tried -- twice. But I didn't listen.
 PICARD / He's unconscious. Why?
 BEVERLY / I'm not certain yet...
 WESLEY / He phased.
 PICARD / (turning to Wesley) What does that mean?
 WESLEY / Parts of him just disappeared, then came back. No one else was paying attention to him the first time.
 RIKER / When we saw it this time, he seemed to be struggling... fighting it...
 BEVERLY / (looking up) He's dying.
 PICARD / (reacting; to Beverly) Save him! He's the only one who can get us back!
 BEVERLY / Realistically, it does not seem possible.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Our position is unknown and our only chance of returning to the known universe is a dying alien...
 The Traveler on a medical table, Beverly and MEDICAL ASSISTANT working over him with a medical tricorder and / other medical equipment, but obviously getting puzzling readings. Picard, Riker, and Wesley wait anxiously too. Kosinski is staying well in b.g.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... who is generally humanoid but with a physiology sufficiently different from our own to create medical problems in caring for him.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Cause?
 BEVERLY / I don't know. My equipment here does not register his kind of life signs. I would have to guess exhaustion, fatigue.
 WESLEY / (concerned) Is he going to be all right?
 PICARD / (irritated; to Riker) What's the boy doing here?
 WESLEY / Mom... he's my friend.
 RIKER / You may want him here before we're done sir. (indicates Traveler) He seemed to feel some kind of relationship with the boy.
 WESLEY / My name is Wesley, Mister Riker.
 PICARD / (snaps) He knows... (softens) ... We all know.
 PICARD / Will he live?
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure.
 PICARD / Wake him.
 BEVERLY / I recommend we let him come around in his own time.
 PICARD / We don't have that luxury. Wake him.
 BEVERLY / (with a glance toward Wesley) He could die and with him any chance we have.
 PICARD / Doctor... (toward Wesley) Wes... You and I have other friends aboard this ship, too. (to Beverly) If we remain in this place any longer we may lose the ability to tell the difference between thought and reality. Regardless of the risk, we must wake him... now.
 PICARD / Do you recognize me? I'm the captain... I need answers.
 TRAVELER / Do my best... to provide...
 PICARD / Who are you? Or what?
 TRAVELER / I am -- a Traveler.
 PICARD / A traveler? What is your destination?
 TRAVELER / (smiles) Destination?
 PICARD / Yes, what place are you trying to reach?
 TRAVELER / Place? No, there is no specific place I wish to go.
 PICARD / Then what is the purpose of this journey?
 TRAVELER / Curiosity.
 PICARD / That's not an answer. What is it that you want?
 TRAVELER / I have certain... "abilities." They give me an understanding of -- propulsion. I have been trading this for passage on Starfleet vessels.
 RIKER / Allowing Kosinski to take the credit for what you did.
 TRAVELER / (trace of a smile) It seemed the sensible way.
 PICARD / Until now.
 TRAVELER / Captain, I seek only transportation in order to see and experience your... your reality. I am not a threat to you, your ship or your crew.
 WESLEY / He isn't, Captain. I know he isn't.
 PICARD / Our "reality?" And in satisfying yourself, you have put my ship and my crew at great risk.
 TRAVELER / I have made some mistakes.
 PICARD / Some mistakes? What kind of "mistake" can cause these incredible explosions of velocity?
 TRAVELER / ... I don't know if I can put it in terms you'll understand.
 PICARD / I believe that there may be a warp speed that could have gotten us to Galaxy M-Thirty-Three... but there is no "velocity" of any magnitude which could bring us to wherever this is. Can you tell us if our navigation sensors are right? Is this millions of light years from where we were?
 TRAVELER / Yes.
 PICARD / What got us here?
 TRAVELER / Thought.
 PICARD / Thought?!
 TRAVELER / You do understand don't you that thought is the basis of all reality? The... "energy" of thought, to put it in your terms, is very powerful.
 KOSINSKI / That's not an explanation.
 TRAVELER / I have the ability to act like a lens which focuses thought.
 KOSINSKI / That's just so much nonsense. You're asking us to believe in magic.
 TRAVELER / Yes -- this could seem like magic to you.
 PICARD / No, it actually makes some sense to me. Only the power of thought could explain what's been happening. Especially out here.
 TRAVELER / Thought is the essence of where you are now. You do understand the danger?
 PICARD / (nods) Chaos. What we think is what happens.
 TRAVELER / It pains me I was so careless, Captain. (sighs with regret) My intent was only to observe, not to cause this. You should not be here until your far, far distant future. Certainly not until you have learned control.
 RIKER / You are from a different time, aren't you?
 TRAVELER / Well -- no -- not exactly from another "time." Although as you understand the concept... yes, perhaps that term fits as well as any.
 RIKER / And you have this ability to... ah... "travel."
 TRAVELER / Yes...
 RIKER / And others of your kind can also "travel?"
 TRAVELER / Yes.
 RIKER / Then, why -- in all of our history -- has there never been a record of you or someone like you having visited us?
 TRAVELER / (laughs) What wonderful arrogance. There is no record because we have not visited you before.
 RIKER / Why not?
 TRAVELER / Ah. Well, up until now ... if you'll forgive this... when compared to many others in the universe, you have been... uninteresting. It's only now that your life form begins to merit serious attention. I'm... sorry...
 PICARD / No, no -- none of that.
 BEVERLY / He's unconscious again.
 PICARD / Revive him.
 BEVERLY / Whatever you need from him, you better get it soon.
 RIKER / I suggest, sir, that the first jump out of our galaxy was as he said, a "mistake"...
 PICARD / Or he was distracted by something.
 RIKER / (nods) But it weakened him in some way, leading to the incredible jump out here.
 KOSINSKI / Theory!
 PICARD / (to Kosinski) Can you propose some facts that fit this?
 PICARD / (with a hard edge) Can you get us back?
 KOSINSKI / Wait, Captain. Not so fast. We have an opportunity for scientific discovery here...
 PICARD / And report our observations how? To whom? (to Traveler) Can you get us back?!
 TRAVELER / I will try.
 PICARD / Number One, you'll take the Traveler to Main Engineering; I'll be on the bridge...
 WESLEY / He is very weak.
 PICARD / I know.
 TRAVELER / The Captain is right. We don't have much time. (to all) But first, I request a moment with the captain. Alone!
 PICARD / Strange how he seems to care for you.
 TRAVELER / He will forget me in time. Which is as it should be. (eyes Picard; then) It is Wesley I wanted to speak to you about.
 PICARD / The boy?
 TRAVELER / (nods) It's best you do not repeat this to the others... especially not to the mother. Whatever may happen, it is best it proceeds naturally.
 PICARD / (hurriedly) I must get my ship back; do we have time for this?
 TRAVELER / Yes. He and a few like him are why I travel. (sitting upright; intent now) You have it in your power to encourage him without interfering...
 PICARD / Encourage him in what?
 TRAVELER / How shall I explain? Are you acquainted with the intricacies of what is called here... music?
 PICARD / Somewhat.
 TRAVELER / And musical genius such as I saw in one of your ship's libraries. One called Mozart, for example? (at Picard's nod) Who as a small child wrote astonishing symphonies as you call them... whose genius made music a tangible reality to be not only heard, but also seen and felt beyond the ability, the understanding, of others?
 TRAVELER / (continuing) Your Wesley is such a person. Not with music but with the equally lovely intricacies of time, energy, propulsion... (gestures) ... and the instruments of this vessel which allow all that to be played.
 TRAVELER / (continuing) You are right, I must hurry now... (pausing at the door) You are right in something else. He is also just a boy for now. He should be encouraged... but told none of this.
 PICARD / Help him to Engineering. I'll be on the bridge. We must try to get back home.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Put it out.
 PICARD / Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts.
 PICARD / Now. Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, any time entry is meaningless. We have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... but wish one variation. A principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts of everyone aboard the Enterprise. We have no idea exactly how this works...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... we understand only that the Traveler makes use of this somehow. It will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what we're attempting to do.
 PICARD / Any further advice, Counselor?
 TROI / When you begin the attempt, there will be stress... And it's only natural that the crew's concentration will shift.
 TASHA / Plus some genuine fear, Captain. You can't notice what's outside without feeling some of that.
 PICARD / ALL DECKS, THIS IS THE CAPTAIN SPEAKING. ALL DECKS...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (amplified) ... I MUST HAVE YOUR FULL ATTENTION. IN A FEW MOMENTS AS WE ATTEMPT TO WARP BACK HOME, IT IS VITAL... ABSOLUTELY VITAL, THAT YOU CENTER YOUR THOUGHTS ON YOUR DUTY... OR UPON THE WELFARE OF THE ONE CALLED 'THE TRAVELER.' THINK OF GIVING HIM SOME...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (amplified) ... OF YOUR STRENGTH. URGENT. THIS IS AN ORDER. YOU MUST TRY TO DO THIS.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (continuing; amplified) YOU WILL ATTEMPT NOW TO CONCENTRATE COMPLETELY ON EITHER YOUR DUTY OF THE MOMENT... OR UPON THE TRAVELER... ON HIS WELL BEING. / 
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (amplified) THINK OF HIM AS SOMEONE YOU CARE DEEPLY ABOUT.
 PICARD / And now to focus their thoughts on that...
 PICARD / (continuing; amplified) ... ALL DECKS, ALL STATIONS, GO TO BATTLE STATIONS.
 TRAVELER / I will need Kosinski back on the main computer.
 KOSINSKI / (tentative) You need me?
 TRAVELER / Yes --
 RIKER / You're looking better.
 TRAVELER / (nods) I'm feeling better.
 PICARD / Helm, set in warp one point five, retroactive course.
 GEORDI / Warp one point five, sir. Retroactive two-six-one mark three-one.
 PICARD / (into Com) Bridge to Engineering...Standby.
 TROI / (smiling) There is such an abundance of well-being on this ship. It feels like... (she smiles) ... quite wonderful.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Engineering to bridge, we're ready.
 PICARD / On my order, Mister Data... Mister La Forge...
 PICARD / Engage!
 PICARD / It's not happening... not enough...
 DATA / Warp one-point-five, sir... (turns) ... which is what my instruments have read all along.
 GEORDI / Our position reads exactly what it was before this sleigh-ride began, sir.
 DATA / Sleigh-ride?
 GEORDI / Or whatever you want to call it, Data. I don't have a name for it.
 RIKER / The Traveler's gone, sir.
 PICARD / Gone?
 RIKER / (nods) He phased completely out of existence... at least out of our existence.
 PICARD / Attention all decks. This is to inform you that the Traveler has left us. With your support, he has returned us to our galaxy. Wherever he has gone, we wish him well.
 PICARD / (continuing; to Riker) Have the boy come up on the bridge, Number One.
 RIKER / (speaking toward his companel) Wesley Crusher, report to the Bridge. (looks to Picard, adds) On the double.
 PICARD / Our next assignment is on this heading?
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data, Mister La Forge... Increase to warp five. Same heading.
 DATA / Warp five, sir.
 GEORDI / Same heading, sir.
 PICARD / Come onto the bridge, Wesley. (as Wesley hesitates) Move!
 PICARD / Commander Riker told me how supportive you were in Engineering. Well done.
 PICARD / (continuing) At ease -- sit here in Command.
 RIKER / Captain -- that's not allowed. Your orders.
 PICARD / Oh, that's true. I can't waive them again. (to Wesley) Only commissioned officers.
 WESLEY / It's quite all right, sir, I understand.
 PICARD / (interrupting) Please don't interrupt me, Wesley.
 WESLEY / (very nervous again) Sorry, sir...
 PICARD / (to Riker) Any commission rank? (he pauses) Even an ensign?
 RIKER / Then he would have authorized access to the bridge.
 PICARD / Well, then, I'll have to make him an Acting Ensign. (he touches a switch) Captain's log Stardate 41263.4. For outstanding performance in the best of Starfleet tradition -- Wesley Crusher is made acting ensign. With all the duties and privileges of that rank. (he clicks off) And Mister Crusher, whether the rank becomes permanent is up to you. (to Wesley) At the first opportunity your entrance application will be tendered to Starfleet Academy. Until then you will learn this ship. Every operation -- every function. Commander Riker -- a duty schedule for Mister Crusher. Heavy on study.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Meanwhile, you can sit and learn something here.
 RIKER / Sir, shall I send for Doctor Crusher?
 PICARD / Why? Is someone ill? (beat; quietly to Wesley) Or do you want to go tell her about this?
 WESLEY / If you don't mind, sir, I'd like to sit here awhile. I'll tell her later.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41194.6. We are in pursuit of a starship of Ferengi design. Our mission is...
 At their regular stations, intent upon the chase, are PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA, GEORDI, TASHA and WORF. / 
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... to intercept and recover a T-9 energy converter which the Ferengi stole from an unmanned monitor post on Gamma Tauri IV -- a theft which automatic scanners recorded, providing us...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... with the long awaited opportunity to make close contact with a Ferengi vessel. If we succeed in this chase, it will be Starfleet's first look at a life form... which discounting rumor, we know almost nothing about.
 RIKER / There she is!
 PICARD / Enlarge.
 PICARD / What is their course?
 GEORDI / They are now angling through that solar system, Captain.
 PICARD / Identify.
 DATA / Listed as Delphi Ardu, sir. Eleven planets, unexplored.
 RIKER / Stay with them, La Forge.
 TASHA / Sensors read a power surge on their last maneuver, Captain.
 GEORDI / They are dropping to sub-warp speed... !
 PICARD / (quickly) Reduce to impulse power... !
 TASHA / Sensor fluctuations in the energy readings from it, Captain.
 DATA / Possibility: a malfunction in their engines, sir.
 GEORDI / Breaks my heart.
 WORF / In visual range, Captain.
 PICARD / Fully enlarge!
 GEORDI / Hello, stranger!
 PICARD / Very impressive design.
 RIKER / Anything on that design, Data?
 DATA / Nothing specific, sir. As you know, Ferengi technology is estimated to be generally equal to our own...
 PICARD / Which does not mean identical, however...
 DATA / Correct, sir. We are no doubt advanced in some areas, they in others...
 GEORDI / (interrupts) They show another power surge, sir.
 WORF / They are firing on us!
 PICARD / Damage report!
 TASHA / Shields holding!
 DATA / Mostly electromagnetic, sir. Fusion generator and batteries down by...
 GEORDI / (interrupts) Our impulse engines are surging!
 WORF / They're firing again.
 TASHA / Deflector shield power weakening, Captain. (looks up) Phasers ready, sir. Photon torpedoes ready...
 RIKER / Shall we return their fire, sir... ?
 PICARD / Negative, Number One. They are reacting to close pursuit. (to Geordi) Fall back a bit but stay with them.
 DATA / They are slowing too, sir.
 TASHA / They may be turning to fight!
 PICARD / Open hailing freq... (to Geordi) Why are we gaining on them? Don't anticipate...
 GEORDI / I'm not, sir! Something's wrong...
 DATA / Sir, something is dragging us forward.
 PICARD / Yes, I read it, too. Lieutenant Yar, what do your sensors show?
 TASHA / Not certain, sir. I'm getting very confusing readings.
 DATA / Captain, this shouldn't be. Our ship's power systems are failing!
 TASHA / Deflector shields failing, phasers going inoperative, sir...
 GEORDI / Something is completely immobilizing us, Captain!
 WORF / Immobilized by the damn Ferengi?!
 PICARD / I need more information! Identify what they are using!
 RIKER / Obviously we've underestimated their technology, Captain...
 PICARD / (nods, rises; alarmed) Considerably. It appears the Ferengi have us right where they want us -- in their sights.
 PICARD / Are we searching all frequencies? Any sign of any kind of message?
 TASHA / Negative, sir.
 PICARD / Weapon report, Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / I have phasers and torpedoes armed, but I show insufficient power to fire them.
 PICARD / Engineering, give me status on power recovery. (waits; no answer) Engineering, come in. (beat) Why aren't they answering? (waits; turns to Geordi) Go below, Lieutenant. Get me a full report from Engineering.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (to Picard) It seems impossible they could be draining all power from all systems.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / I'm sensing nothing from them Captain. Which could mean they can shield their thoughts and emotions from others.
 PICARD / Which still makes it our move.
 TROI / Sir, they may know as little about us as we do about them.
 RIKER / Except that they know they've got us in deep trouble.
 PICARD / If so, the question becomes how will they use that knowledge? (to Data) Is there any hard information on them in any file, Data?
 DATA / None, sir. Only hearsay and thirdhand reports, most of which conflict.
 RIKER / Which rumors do not conflict?
 DATA / That the Ferengi are... well, the best description may be "traders."
 PICARD / What kind of "traders"?
 DATA / A more accurate comparison modern scholars have drawn from Earth history cites the ocean-going "Yankee Traders" of eighteenth and nineteenth century America, sir.
 RIKER / From the history of my forebears? "Yankee Traders?"
 DATA / (nods) Who sail, in this case the galaxy, in search of mercantile and territorial opportunity.
 RIKER / And are those scholars saying the Ferengi may not be too different from us?
 DATA / Hardly, sir. I believe this analogy refers to the nefarious capitalist manner in which the Ferengi are known to conduct their affairs of commerce. (thought) "Never give a sucker an even break."
 PICARD / And what does that mean, Data?
 DATA / I'm not sure, sir. That entry was only identified as "slang", terms or expressions which typify everyday language of...
 PICARD / I know what slang is, Data. I just haven't heard of that particular saying.
 RIKER / But "Yankee Traders"... (smile) I like the sound of that. Has a nice historical ring to it.
 PICARD / (impatient) Engineering? (no answer; to Riker) Join La Forge "down below", Number One. Without our warp capacity, we're just one big floating target.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to Data) What other pertinent meaning do you draw from this analogy, "Yankee Traders?"
 DATA / Well, I doubt if they wear red, white and blue, sir. Or look anything like Uncle Sam.
 WORF / Uncle who?
 TASHA / What have bright, primal colors got to do with it?
 PICARD / Yes, I understand the allusion. (nods) Colors that once identified nations during the time when they competed against each other. Red, white and blue for the United States... (muses) Whereas the French oddly used the same colors in the order of blue, white, and red...
 DATA / ... and the German nation black, red and gold; the Italians green, white and red; the British...
 PICARD / (annoyed) Enough, Data!
 DATA / Sir, it was you who...
 PICARD / (snaps) We're discussing the Ferengi, Data! (slow burn) Mon Dieu, I wish I knew what they will do next...
 DATA / Given what is occurring to our vessel, Captain, their weapons could be vastly superior to ours.
 PICARD / Yes, Data. That seems a reasonable assumption. (louder) Engineering?!
 RIKER / Bottom line, La Forge.
 GEORDI / Not good, sir. The Ferengi forcefield that holds this ship compensates... (taps board) Almost as fast as we increase power.
 RIKER / Almost?
 GEORDI / There's a point-three-hundred, seventy-two millisecond delay between use of our power and the neutralizing counter-force of the Ferengi... (stumped) We push and they push back in equal force, sir.
 RIKER / (idea) And what is our acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse and top warp speed?
 GEORDI / Point-three-hundred millisecond. (big smile) I know what you're thinking. Shift down and then blow hard into warp nine, yes? Come back fighting, whooey!
 RIKER / Can we do it, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Ask me after it's done, sir. (to Engineers) I want a slow reverse-power drop-off over five minutes... (to Riker) We'll show them what this baby can do, sir.
 RIKER / Give me everything you've got.
 GEORDI / Aye, aye, sir.
 RIKER / ... and with a sudden, abrupt power surge to high warp speed, Captain, I believe we can break loose from the Ferengi forcefield.
 PICARD / I wish I knew how they are doing this to us.
 RIKER / I wonder what they're thinking over there.
 PICARD / That's easy. They're wondering what we are thinking... and what we might do next.
 WORF / I say fight, sir. There is nothing shameful in falling before a superior enemy.
 PICARD / (thin smile at Worf) And nothing shameful about a strategic retreat, either.
 GEORDI / All systems ready, Captain. And communication's restored to Engineering.
 PICARD / Excellent, La Forge. (to Riker) Let's throw them off guard. (turning) Lieutenant Yar. Open hailing frequencies.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / At least, I won't begin with weakness. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (looking up; voice AMPLIFIED) Attention Ferengi starship! This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. In the name of the United Federation of Planets, I demand you return the T-9 energy converter you removed from Gamma Tauri IV. (to Tasha; normal voice) Send in all language forms.
 TASHA / All language forms, sir.
 PICARD / Sometimes, Riker, the best way to win a fight is not to be there.
 RIKER / Yes, sir. "He will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight."
 PICARD / Glad the Academy still teaches the strategy of Sun Tzu... (to Geordi) Let's hope that delay proves out, La Forge.
 GEORDI / (nods) Point-three-hundred milliseconds, sir.
 PICARD / We'll blast full power into warp nine. Ready?
 GEORDI / All systems ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Countdown to three. Stand by on phasers. (firm) One. Set warp to nine. (everyone tenses) Two. Divert shield power to main engines... (they brace) Three!
 PICARD / (softly) Merde. (troubled) Shields up.
 DATA / Captain? I think you better see this...
 PICARD / (moving to Data) What's wrong?
 DATA / In my opinion, someone is reading every file, every "bit" of information stored in the Enterprise memory banks...
 GEORDI / (impressed) They can do that?
 DATA / And more, perhaps.
 PICARD / (into Com) Doctor Crusher to the bridge. (to entire bridge) Conference evaluation.
 TROI / If I may recommend something, Captain, with our attention on the Ferengi vessel, we have ignored the planet.
 PICARD / Consult the charts on this planet, Data. See what we have on it in the library.
 BEVERLY / No response on hailing frequencies?
 PICARD / We had no response. (including the others) So, while we still have some power left, it is time for difficult decisions. (thin smile) While we cannot have a democracy aboard, I value your considered opinions.
 TASHA / I say put all available power into a full-out combined phaser and photon torpedo salvo. Destroy their ability to sustain this forcefield, sir.
 WORF / Yes! Hit them hard and hit them fast.
 PICARD / Impractical and provocative. Assuming even that we have the power to support that tactic.
 TASHA / But Captain, firing on us was not an act of war?
 TROI / The facts are that the Ferengi did fire at us, but we were chasing them. Since then, they've only searched our computers, trying to learn who and what we are.
 PICARD / Your point, Counselor?
 TROI / Let's talk to them.
 PICARD / That has been tried; no response.
 TROI / But did we tell them anything they wanted to hear?
 PICARD / Any other observations?
 PICARD / (continuing) Thank you all for your advice and counsel. Now if you will excuse me, I'd like to be left alone with Commander Riker.
 PICARD / As my first officer, I assume you fully realize our situation. Although the final decision must be mine, this is your opportunity to speak your mind.
 RIKER / I believe we have covered all available alternatives, Captain, but... (supportive) Are there any other options you wish to analyze?
 PICARD / The only one left needs no conversation, Number One. And it is the only one we must avoid.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / Total annihilation.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 DATA / Open, Captain.
 PICARD / (a pregnant beat) Attention, Ferengi starship! This is Captain Picard. It is obvious we have a situation here that needs resolving... And we are willing to do whatever is reasonable and necessary. I would like... I would appreciate... your presenting your terms to us.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41194.8. It is with a heavy heart that I have offered to meet...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... whatever reasonable and necessary terms are demanded by the Ferengi. I fear for my people and my vessel in the event the unknown Ferengi ask the unreasonable. How...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... can I oppose even unreasonable demands?
 RIKER / It's moving, sir.
 WORF (V.O.) / We ask to surrender and now they fire on us?
 TASHA / Ready torpedoes, sir? There's enough power for a couple of them.
 PICARD / Ready. But hold at ready, Lieutenant. (to Data) Open hailing frequencies.
 DATA / Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / Ferengi vessel, we are awaiting your response.
 TASHA / Suggest first strike, sir. Our shields now only have sixty-three seconds of power available before lowering.
 WORF / If the Ferengi ship's sensors can read us, sir, they will be waiting until we are most vulnerable...
 RIKER / Captain, I'm afraid I agree. Since they haven't bothered to answer us...
 PICARD / (interrupting; quiet voiced) I'll wait a bit more, Number One.
 TASHA / Fifty seconds...
 PICARD / Patience. Patience...
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / The quicker we can come to terms, the better, NCC 1701-D.
 PICARD / Who is speaking?
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / I am Taar. DaiMon of the Ferengi. You wished to discuss surrender, Captain Picard?
 PICARD / What I actually said, DaiMon, is...
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / (interrupting) UNCONDITIONAL...
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / (continuing; a difficult beat) ... Surrender, I warn you, is... (emphatic) Totally unacceptable!! (desperate but proud) We will die to the last one of us before such dishonor!
 TASHA / Hailing frequency off, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Something has seized their ship too. They're in the same predicament as us. (to Geordi) Launch a sensor probe. Set it to search for the source of this "something" that's holding us both. (to Tasha) Back to hailing fequencies, fast. (Com technique) ... and so I regret DaiMon Taar that I can no longer negotiate unless it is conducted visually.
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / (beat; concerned) Your complete message not received, Enterprise. But visual communication is against our custom.
 PICARD / (into Com) And it is against Starfleet orders to accept a surrender otherwise. Do you withdraw your surrender offer?
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / You give us no choice, Enterprise. May we have a visual on you too?
 PICARD / (into Com) Agreed, DaiMon Taar. You should be able to view us now. (waits) Do you have us on your screen?
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / We... are now viewing you.
 TAAR'S COM VOICE / I do not know how your twisted alien culture has paralyzed our vessel but I concede your 'Enterprise' is superior. (snaps) We will return your worthless T-9 device and we offer the life of our second officers as required by the Ferengi code.
 DATA / I am relieved we have no such code involving our second officers.
 TAAR (V.O.) / Is this to your satisfaction, Picard Captain?
 PICARD / Your offer may be inadequate, but I will discuss it with my staff. Stand by for further communications.
 RIKER / (to the Teens on ENTERING) Matthews! Pola! You know this area is off-limits. (as Boys LEAVE) Boys will be boys, Captain.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Have you launched the probe?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. We'll get readings soon.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) If we're not holding the Ferengi and they're not holding us... then who the hell is? (to Data) Next, you wanted to show us something?
 DATA / As requested, Captain, library-computer information on this planet.
 DATA / It has been charted only, from long range scans. It is Class M, but with no indications of life forms, sentient or otherwise. However, you may find this of interest...
 DATA / (continuing) Resolving it into our language...
 PICARD / A space federation of some sort. But I've never heard the word "Tkon."
 DATA / (distracted by stuck finger) Understandable. It has been extinct six hundred thousand of... of our years. (back to viewer; back to finger problem) According to... legend, these planets... were outposts... of that empire...
 PICARD / Data. What are you doing?
 DATA / Apologies, Captain. I seem to have reached an odd functional impass. I am, ah... (futile tug) Stuck.
 PICARD / Then get unstuck and continue your briefing.
 DATA / Yes, sir. That is what I am trying to do... (no go again) But the solution eludes me.
 GEORDI / (laughs) My hero.
 PICARD / Continue, Commander. Now!
 DATA / (eyeing the puzzle) Intriguing. (then quickly indicating viewscreen) Again, only legend, but it describes the Empire as impossibly huge and powerful.
 RIKER / (eyeing viewscreen) Surrounded by stars whose planets formed its defensive system?
 DATA / Correct, sir. Outposts. And the planet below was possibly one of them...
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Excuse the interruption, Captain, but this may be worth it. We're now receiving a signal from the probe.
 PICARD / We'll take it here, please.
 GEORDI / Incredible!
 RIKER / That's our mysterious "something," Captain. It is a forcefield of some kind...
 PICARD / Reaching up from the planet surface. What enormous power! (to Data) How does the legend describe the end of the Tkon Empire?
 DATA / By their Sun going supernova, sir.
 PICARD / Could this planet have escaped that?
 DATA / This planet, Gamma Tauri IV, could have been the most distant outpost, sir, in theory. But since it shows no life form readings...
 PICARD / (to Riker) We'll have to look it over, Number One. Stand by with an away team.
 RIKER / (stands) And if the Ferengi also realize the forcefield emanates from the planet, sir?
 PICARD / (considers it) That's a complication. We may have to ask them to join us in this.
 GEORDI / (surprised) Team up with the Ferengi, sir?
 PICARD / We were ordered to learn what we can about them. Do you know of a better way than that?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. In orbit of the mysterious planet Gamma Tauri IV in the Delphi Ardu star system, whose unexplained forcefield has seized us with a power almost beyond imagination. If...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... there is a solution to this, it almost certainly will involve cooperation from the Ferengi... a life form which seems as unknown and mysterious as the planet we orbit.
 TASHA / Ship's power drain is critical, Captain. I must now shut down our shields to maintain life support systems.
 PICARD / Understood, Lieutenant. Open hailing frequencies.
 TASHA / (touching controls) Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / Ferengi vessel from Enterprise, this is Captain Picard. Come in.
 as Main Viewer ripples into IMAGE OF THE FACE OF DAIMON TAAR again -- and it is still lens-twisted, appearing as / large and foreboding as before. He looks up at the screen and then:
 TAAR / Your alien images again shock us.
 PICARD / DaiMon Tarr, regarding your surrender to us, the facts are somewhat different...
 TAAR / (interrupting; angrily) Our own probe has already shown us your trickery, hu-man. (emphatic) We withdraw our surrender.
 PICARD / Agreed, DaiMon. May this may be a far more productive relationship.
 TAAR / I prefer a profitable one, hu-man.
 DATA / (quietly, toward Picard) "Yankee Traders."
 TAAR / (bristling) Explain. What means this "yangeetraters"?
 GEORDI / He heard that?
 PICARD / It... acknowledges your interest in profit, DaiMon Taar. Is that an incorrect assumption?
 TAAR / We seek only what is equitable. (angrily) What do you seek? Why did you begin by attacking us?
 PICARD / We did not attack. We gave chase in order to recover a Federation-owned energy device which...
 TAAR / (interrupting) ... which we know is ours. Your barbarous Federation chose to place it on one of our planets!
 PICARD / On the contrary, Gamma Tauri IV is recognized by all civilized members of...
 TAAR / (outraged) The Ferengi are not uncivilized, hu-man! Is that what you suggest?!
 PICARD / All I am trying to say is you have taken a device clearly not your own from...
 TAAR / (incredulous) Are you now calling us thieves?!
 PICARD / Certainly not. And I have no wish to argue issues of territory or property, when our mutual problem remains. Like it or not... (firm) We are both trapped by the power draining forcefield of this planet.
 TAAR / (lets up) On that matter, there can be no argument.
 PICARD / Might I propose a swap?
 TAAR / And... what is a "szwop"?
 PICARD / An exchange, a trade...
 TAAR / Yes, trade, hu-man. What is your offer?
 PICARD / We will give you what we know about the planet, and in trade, you will give us your information.
 TAAR / Ridiculous. How will we know you have not cheated us?
 PICARD / We must trust each other, Taar.
 TAAR / Amusing, hu-man. But impractical.
 PICARD / Then may I propose we both cooperate in a joint examination of the planet surface?
 TAAR / And what profit is in this, Picard Captain?
 PICARD / The profit, DaiMon Tarr, lies in saving all our lives.
 TAAR / We will agree to this. But I warn you now, any further trickery on your part will be met with no mercy. Understood?
 PICARD / Understood. (onward) If you care to join us, we have a well-proven transporter device which...
 TAAR / We have a matter-energy device of our own. We will beam a science team of three to whatever coordinates you propose.
 PICARD / Excellent. We will transmit that information shortly. Enterprise out.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies off.
 PICARD / I'll log that as "promising," at least.
 RIKER / I wonder, Captain. Ordinarily, I don't believe in distrust at first sight... but this may be an exception.
 DATA / Especially in view of the fact the image he transmitted was likely distorted somehow, sir.
 TROI / I felt the same thing, Captain. He was hiding something.
 RIKER / (stands) With this power drain I see no reason to delay, sir. (looks around) I'd like some additional help on this. Can you spare Worf?
 PICARD / (nods) Take him. And be careful, Number One.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / With this power drain, we may have trouble communicating with you, sir.
 RIKER / Understood. Anything else?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / (reluctant) Due to this forcefield, there is presently no way... to beam you back, sir.
 GEORDI / You had to ask.
 RIKER / Understood. (checking the others, then) Energize!
 RIKER / Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf?!
 RIKER / Anybody?!
 DATA / Very intriguing, sir.
 RIKER / What are you doing up there?
 DATA / (climbs down) I assume a problem of program coordinates due to the energy field around the ship, sir. (glances around) Are we alone?
 RIKER / Unfortunately. (indicates trees) What do you make of these?
 DATA / Crystalline, quite inert. "Nothing to write home about."
 RIKER / (delayed take) Excuse me?
 DATA / That is slang, sir. (concern) I did use it correctly, did I not?
 RIKER / (why me?) Let's find the others...
 RIKER (V.O) / ... they can't be too far.
 DATA (V.O.) / Actually, the forces responsible for this effect would create a random...
 DATA / (continuing) ... transporter distribution inversely proportional to the density of...
 RIKER / Who's that?
 DATA / What?
 RIKER / That!
 RIKER_DATA (V.O) / Geordi!
 RIKER / Geordi?! Are you conscious?
 GEORDI / Do I look conscious?
 RIKER / No. What are you doing?
 GEORDI / Trying to relax, sir. My foot's caught... (points up) Up there. I materialized upside down about ten meters above the surface.
 DATA / Tricorder is useless here, sir. Communications are gone, too.
 DATA / (continuing; to Geordi) It is fortunate you did not break anyth...
 GEORDI / Who's that?!
 RIKER (V.O.) / Who are you?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. It is now six hours since our away team beamed down to the planet surface. On the Enterprise...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... our condition is rapidly worsening. Ordinarily, with reserve power alone, we could maintain life support for several months. But the force holding us...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... has closed down all engines and is draining our reserve power too... Equally impossible, our oxygen level is also dropping.
 TROI / It's getting much... (stops; out of breath) ... much colder, sir.
 PICARD / How far down is it likely to go?
 BEVERLY / A lot. Even in orbital space it gets past minus two hundred degrees.
 TROI / We won't have to worry past... (tries to smile) ... minus seventy or so.
 PICARD / (shivers) Feels like that right now.
 LETEK / If he moves, kill him.
 LETEK / We will accuse the hu-mans of preparing to ambush us. It will be our word against theirs and who is more trustworthy, Mordoc?
 LETEK / (to himself) Hmmm. Looks like gold... (gives it a lick) ... tastes like gold.
 RIKER (V.O.) / It is gold!
 LETEK / (soft, low voice) Accursed planet! What pandemonium!
 RIKER / Nothing compared to what my captain will do... (sees he's causing pain; speaks softly) ... when he learns you've broken our landing party agreement.
 LETEK / What part of the agreement?
 LETEK / (continuing) You appeared and attacked us. Are you one of their assassins?
 RIKER / I am Commander Riker, first officer of the USS Enterprise. Stop now unless you want our vessel to retaliate...
 RIKER / I've got this one!
 DATA / Careful, Commander, they're much stronger than...
 WORF / (loudly) PYGMY CRETINS... !
 LETEK / Kill them.
 TASHA (V. O.) / NOOO-O-O!!
 TASHA / That's much better, now over there...
 LETEK / (to Riker) Then it is true. You work with females, arm them, and force them to wear clothing?
 BEVERLY / I should visit... the family decks...again...
 PICARD / (shakes head) I've diverted... all reserve... power there. They'll... last longest. (looks around) Is there anything else we can do, Doctor?
 PICARD / (continuing) Where is... your son Wesley?
 BEVERLY / (beat) I gave him... something. He'll have a... terrible headache if we live.
 PICARD / You shouldn't have.
 BEVERLY / Shouldn't have? (weak but outraged) He's my son. I love him...
 PICARD / He has the... right to meet... death awake.
 BEVERLY / That is... a male perspective!
 BEVERLY / (continuing) What? (beat; louder) What did you say, Jean-Luc?
 PICARD / I said... rubbish!
 TASHA / Stop! Hold it right there!
 RIKER / Set for stun!
 TASHA / (nods) Already set.
 TASHA / What is going on?!
 LETEK / What is this?!
 DATA / How intriguing. (to Humans and Ferengi) I believe we can deduce these crystalline tree-shapes to be energy collectors.
 RIKER / (nods) Along the same principle that is draining energy from our ships.
 GEORDI / But the Ferengi weapons were working when we arrived here...
 TASHA / Which means something new has happened...
 GEORDI / Commander!
 PORTAL FIGURE / BE YOU BARBARIANS?! SPEAK!
 PORTAL / WHO MEETS THE CHALLENGE?
 GEORDI / I'm beginning to understand what... (touches VISOR) ... these "eyes" have been showing me. Patterns of force everywhere. This entire planet has been made into... well, a power accumulator.
 RIKER / (indicating crystalline shape) And that?
 GEORDI / ... is the whole point of this place. I can "see" the planet's power emanating from...
 PORTAL / WHO WILL IT BE?
 LETEK / Riker.
 PORTAL / (to Riker) YOU HAVE AWAKENED PORTAL SIX-THREE. DO YOU PETITION TO ENTER THE EMPIRE?
 RIKER / Who asks the question?
 PORTAL / (echo effect) I AM THE PORTAL, GUARDIAN OF THE TKON EMPIRE.
 RIKER / Why should we petition for entry to an empire that no longer exists?
 PORTAL / Biped...extraordinary. (looks up) Why do you attempt deception? The empire is forever.
 RIKER / Your empire fell prey to a supernova...
 PORTAL / Nonsense!
 RIKER / Data. Please repeat the file...
 DATA / It is a matter of record, Portal, in the Age of Makto, the central star of the Tkon Empire destabilized and...
 PORTAL / (interrupts) But the Age of Makto is an eon in the future to come...
 DATA / (interrupts back) In fact, there have been many ages which have come and passed since Makto...
 PORTAL / (and back again) This is the Age of Bastu!
 DATA / (relentless) I am afraid not, as by the Tkon use of galactic motionary startime charts, after Bastu, there has been Cimi, Xora, Makto, Ozari, Fendor...
 PORTAL / (enraged) ENOUGH! (thunder clap) This is absurd! That is over seven baktun of time! How can this be?
 RIKER / You must have been asleep, Portal, for hundreds of thousands of our years...
 LETEK / Deception is the way of these hu-mans. We Ferengi will gladly make a petition.
 RIKER / (to Portal) We invite their petition.
 DATA / Excellent idea, sir.
 GEORDI / I can't wait to hear it...
 PORTAL / Speak.
 LETEK / We... our petition is that we be allowed to... serve the Tkon Empire... (decides to add) ... at no profit! Return control of our starship to us and we will happily destroy both the hu-man criminals and their vessel which attacked us without provocation. (too eager) They came to loot your empire, but we intercepted them!
 PORTAL / You have attempted deceit. Next you cannot answer these accusations. Do you give yourself up for judgment?
 RIKER / (beat; considering this) Yes. If you believe those accusations, you should act on them.
 LETEK / And there is even more! We can prove the hu-mans are destroyers of legal commerce ... also that they selfishly withhold vital technology from backward worlds...
 RIKER / I admit we restrict advanced technology to all...
 LETEK / (exhibiting the Starfleet insignias taken) Proof of their barbarism -- they adorn themselves with gold, a despicable use of rare metal... (indicates Tasha) And they shamelessly clothe their females...
 TASHA / Paws off, Ferengi.
 TASHA / (moves toward Mordoc; deadly) Just try it, shorty.
 RIKER / (warning) At ease, Lieutenant!
 GEORDI / (to Ferengi) I wouldn't mess with Lieutenant Yar if I were you... (to Riker) But maybe they'd like to find out the hard way, eh, Number One?
 RIKER / Seems their style. (to Portal) Would you like to hear more?
 PORTAL / If you desire.
 DATA / (nods) They should add also that Starfleet has refused to prevent several civilizations from falling; we have sometimes let the violent and strong overcome the weak...
 LETEK / (to Portal) They admit their crimes! Hear them; they admit the evil which they... !
 PORTAL / BARBARIAN!
 LETEK / Yes, you show wisdom...
 PORTAL / (interrupting; indicates the Ferengi, too) BARBARIANS, ALL! (indicates Riker with sword) But this one first. In the fashion the Empire has always challenged savages...
 WORF / No! For battle, come to me...
 PORTAL / (mixed-THUNDER) You have a single chance for life. One only. What is the answer to my challenge?
 RIKER / (facing Portal Figure, unmoving) There is more! Self-determination of all peoples...
 PORTAL / (interrupting) You are being tested, Riker! WHAT IS THE ANSWER?
 RIKER / How do you know my name?
 PORTAL / Ahhh. You are of immovable mind, Riker. One totally committed to facing any fate with composure... (sword still up) But what is the answer to my challenge?
 RIKER / Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.
 PORTAL / You are a noble being. And unlike these little ones who close their minds, your mind holds interesting thoughts. (quoting) "Know your enemy and know yourself, and victory will always be yours." Why that thought? And who is this "Sun Tzu" you revere?
 RIKER / An old Chinese philosopher from ancient Earth history...
 PORTAL / You must tell me more of this wisdom so much like our own.
 RIKER / Gladly. First, our starship. Can you release it?
 PORTAL / (nods) It is released. (looks upward, nods) All power is restored.
 BEVERLY / Not a hell of a lot too soon, Jean...Captain.
 PORTAL / (to Riker) I admit I had my doubts as your ships battled each other...
 LETEK / They tried to kill us!
 PORTAL / (ignores him) In overt acts of belligerance. Normally, I would have destroyed all of you and your ships, but something confused me.
 RIKER / Which was?
 PORTAL / First you wanted to murder each other, then you were willing to help each other.
 LETEK / What of our vessel? We knew the same answer...
 PORTAL / (to Riker) What of them? Shall I destroy them?
 RIKER / Then they would learn nothing.
 PORTAL / Admirable conclusion. But what makes you think they will ever learn, Riker?
 RIKER / (beat) Is this a test also?
 PORTAL / In life, one is always tested.
 RIKER / I find them very much as we were a few hundred years ago... but with the technology we have now. They're very dangerous...
 RIKER / (unhearing; to Portal) But we can hardly hate what we once were. They may grow and learn...
 PORTAL / ... And learn ways of destroying you.
 RIKER / Our values require us to face that possibility. What of you? With your empire gone... ?
 PORTAL / Even without the empire, the uncivilized must be tested. (sadly) I shall sleep... until needed again.
 81   INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING GEORDI ANDD DATA / 
 TROI / What happened?
 DATA / Something to write home about.
 GEORDI / "Something to write home about?" Data, that's very human.
 RIKER / The T-9 energy converter was beamed aboard and secured, sir.
 PICARD / I commend your performance, Number One.
 RIKER / I do have a request, sir.
 RIKER / (continuing) Permission to beam a box of Data's Chinese finger puzzles over to the Ferengi. (postscript) A "thank you" for all they tried to do.
 PICARD / (smiles) Make it so.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41249.3. We have orbited the two major planets of the Beta Renner system taking aboard delegates from those two worlds. Since achieving space flight, their major life forms, the Anticans and the Selay...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... have become deadly enemies. But both have also applied for admission into our Federation. We are to deliver these delegates to this sector's neutral Conference Planet called "Parliament" in the hope their dispute can be resolved.
 PICARD / I am Captain Picard. We hope to make this journey pleasant and comfortable. Arranging that will be my first officer, Commander Riker.
 RIKER / Welcome aboard. If you'll follow me... (starts MOVING OFF) ... I'll show you the accommodations we've...
 SSESTAR / We can already smell the Anticans. They were taken aboard first?
 PICARD / Only because their world was the first on our heading to Parliament.
 SSESTAR / Will our quarters be near the Anticans?
 PICARD / About one hundred meters apart. Is that all right?
 SSESTAR / No. Unsatisfactory.
 RIKER / I believe we can accommodate their wishes, Captain. (to Ssestar) We'll rearrange suite assignments. If you'll follow me?
 SSESTAR / And we must be upwind from the Anticans.
 RIKER / Of course, sir...
 TASHA / Neither seem very promising Federation candidates.
 PICARD / Even Parliament's peacemakers may find this case difficult.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Do you understand the basis of all that nonsense between them?
 RIKER / No sir. I didn't understand that kind of hostility even when I studied Earth history.
 PICARD / Oh? Well, yes, but these life forms feel such passionate hatred over differences in customs, God concepts, and even strangely enough, economic systems...
 DATA / Sir, my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object ahead.
 PICARD / On screen.
 TASHA / Confirmed, sir. My sensors read nothing solid but considerable energy in... (puzzles over reading) ... in changing patterns.
 DATA / Traveling at warp speed, too. Intriguing. (tabs panel, looks up) I can find no match with anything in our records, sir.
 PICARD / (eyes viewer; then) Change course for a close sensor pass... we'll then increase warp speed to reach Parliament on schedule.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / Why the interest in this, Worf? It is just routine maintenance on the sensor assemblies.
 WORF / Simple, Geordi. Our captain wants his junior officers to learn, learn, learn...
 GEORDI / (grins) Not just the junior ones. (indicates) Okay, hold this relay off-line while...
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Security to Sensor Maintenance.
 GEORDI / La Forge here.
 TASHA / We're making a close sensor pass on an unusual object, Geordi. Any problems?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / None, Lieutenant. All equipment on line and functioning.
 TASHA / (turns to Captain) Sensors ready, sir.
 PICARD / (to Data) Life form reading?
 DATA / No life form reading, sir.
 PICARD / Begin the pass.
 DATA / Sir, it is changing shape... !
 PICARD / Any readings indicating matter there?
 DATA / Negative, Captain. Energy only.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Sickbay. Medical emergency in Sensor Maintenance Room!
 GEORDI / (continuing) Repeat -- medical emergency!
 BEVERLY / What happened?
 GEORDI / Don't know. It seemed like he was hit by... (shakes head) ... some sensor feedback, maybe.
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant Worf? (no response) Lieutenant, can you hear what I'm saying?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Let's get him up.
 GEORDI / He was just monitoring the sensor console when he jerked as though something hit him. What my sensors showed... (frowns) ... It was kind of a... glow... just for a second. I can't explain it.
 PICARD / Could your VISOR device have malfunctioned?
 GEORDI / Doubt it, sir. It seemed what I was seeing was something real.
 BEVERLY / I'm going to give you something to help you rest. Just relax.
 BEVERLY / Fortunately, he's stronger than an orbital tug. There's nothing physically wrong with him. What have you sensed?
 TROI / Nothing... which bothers me. He has never shielded his feelings from me. I can't understand why he is suddenly doing it now.
 BEVERLY / Are you able to perceive anything at all, Counselor? It may be important.
 TROI / (beat; concentrating) Perhaps... very faintly. Almost... like a frightened child.
 BEVERLY / Worf "frightened?"
 TROI / It doesn't make much sense but... (beat; concentrating) Yes, it's fear. Definitely there.
 TASHA / Sorry to call you, sir, not strictly security, it's about the dietary requirements of the Antican delegates.
 RIKER / I thought that had been taken care of in advance, Tasha.
 TASHA / So did we, sir. Their live animals were beamed aboard -- We were going to preserve the meat for them, but .... (squeamishly) ... they say we must bring it to them alive.
 RIKER / (beat) Then do so! (to the Antican) Lieutenant Yar was... confused. We no longer enslave animals for food purposes.
 RIKER / You've seen something as fresh and tasty as living meat, but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters.
 TROI / He's reading normal? How did you manage that?
 BEVERLY / (dazed) Yes... normal, now.
 TROI / (looks up quickly) Are you all right?
 BEVERLY / Yes... perfectly.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Yes... both of us quite normal.
 WORF / Where... where am I?
 TROI / Don't you remember? You were in the Sensor Maintenance Room ---
 WORF / I remember monitoring the sensor console -- and that's all. What am I doing here?
 TROI / That's a story the doctor will tell you.
 DATA / I called it a "cloud" for lack of a better term at the time. But the sensor pass shows it as much more. Combinations very complex, precise energy patterns...
 PICARD / Constantly interacting on each other?
 DATA / Yes, sir... But whether individually or as a whole, it is difficult to say.
 PICARD / Obviously, you seem to feel it should be inspected more closely.
 DATA / A mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated, sir.
 PICARD / Ah. I love a mystery, Mister Data, but this one has to wait until we deliver the delegates to their peace conference on Parliament.
 WESLEY / Hi Mom. You're back early.
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 WESLEY / Physical sciences class. We're studying Doctor Channing's theory on dilithium crystals.
 BEVERLY / Tell me about it.
 WESLEY / Really? You never seemed that interested in warp theory before. (indicates) Doctor Channing thinks it's possible to force dilithium into even more useful crystals. If as shown here, matter and antimatter could be aligned even more efficiently...
 BEVERLY / (interrupting) Would that affect navigation?
 WESLEY / This is engineering, not helm control.
 BEVERLY / Oh yes, the helm's located on the bridge.
 WESLEY / (stares, concerned) Mom, is something wrong?
 BEVERLY / (to herself) This... is the helm.
 GEORDI / Unless there have been some changes I don't know about.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher?
 BEVERLY / You will wish to know Lieutenant Worf is much improved. Ready to report back on duty.
 PICARD / What was the diagnosis?
 BEVERLY / A temporary mental abberation.
 PICARD / When it concerns a bridge officer, I expect a better explanation, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Then I must first run some crosschecks in the library-computer. Klingons are so unusual in their reactions, aren't they?
 PICARD / (still puzzled, but:) Take Science Station Two, Doctor.
 DATA / Intriguing, Doctor. What does helm control have to do with medical crosschecks?
 BEVERLY / I... I don't know why I'm...
 DATA / (looks up) Is something wrong, Doctor?
 PICARD / Doctor, are you all right?
 BEVERLY / Yes... yes. I -- I'll do my work from my office. That's where I should be...
 PICARD / Do you want someone to accompany you?
 PICARD / Counselor, what's happening to my people?
 DATA / Captain? There is a malfunction in this station. I cannot bring any information up on it.
 DATA / (continuing) Science Two does not function either, sir.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Transporter Room Six to bridge. Reporting transporter console malfunction, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data, this ship is less than a year out of spacedock. What are the chances of all this occurring?
 DATA / It is a virtual impossibility, sir.
 PICARD / So what the hell is going on here?
 PICARD / ... I don't understand it, Gentlemen. I need information. You're telling me there is no explanation for any of these malfunctions?
 RIKER / At least, sir, all department heads report the damage repaired.
 PICARD / That was not the question, Number One. What caused the malfunctions?
 PICARD / Yes, Mister Singh?
 PICARD / Have you spoken with Chief Engineer Argyle about the problem?
 PICARD / I am not satisfied with that. (to the others) I want explanations of this by the time we get to Parliament.
 PICARD / By the time we get to Parliament, Mr. Singh.
 RIKER / These weapons were removed from two of your people who were loitering out of sight in the vicinity of the Selay delegation quarters. Would you care to explain, sir?
 TASHA / Your food supply is not on the same deck as the Selay delegation, sir.
 RIKER / And you will admit these "tools" can kill.
 TASHA / They appear to have the same feelings about you, sir.
 RIKER / Nonetheless, Chief Delegate, I'm putting you on notice that all weapons -- no matter what their basic function -- are being confiscated. Violence will not be tolerated on the Enterprise.
 RIKER AND TASHA / Thank you, sir.
 WORF / Sir, warp power is fading!
 PICARD / Picard to Engineering. What is our problem?
 WORF / Warp five... four... three... two...
 WESLEY / And we just dropped below warp one, sir.
 GEORDI / Go to impulse power!
 PICARD / State of the art vessel? Hah. Commander Data, signal Parliament that we will be delayed. We will send the new arrival time as soon as determined.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / (continuing) Sir, subspace radio is out.
 PICARD / Your theories on the sudden vulnerability of these systems, gentlemen?
 DATA / If the Enterprise were really this fragile, sir, she never would have gotten out of spacedock. Therefore, her systems failures are not endemic to the ship, but are more likely the result of the actions of an unknown adversary.
 RIKER / We have a saboteur aboard.
 DATA / I believe I said that.
 PICARD / (firmly) Gentlemen. The question now is, who. I can't believe it's one of our people.
 RIKER / Agreed. Which leaves someone in either alien delegation. If the Ferengi bribed or bought even one of them, that's all that would be needed.
 DATA / Ferengi contacts have been detected on both Selay and Antica, sir.
 PICARD / Can any of you suggest another solution?
 RIKER / (amused) You're sounding like a private eye, sir.
 DATA / Query: private eye?
 PICARD / A private consulting investigator who solves crimes.
 DATA / A most interesting occupation.
 PICARD / In the world of fact, it is, Data. However in literature, criminal detection becomes a fascinating exercise. (a glance to Riker) The immortal Sherlock Holmes would have an interesting view of our mystery, I believe.
 RIKER / I'm sure, sir -- but I'm afraid we have to find our solution without History's Greatest Consulting Detective.
 WESLEY / Is it there, Mister Singh? If the control network breaks at that point...
 WESLEY / But, sir --
 WESLEY / Yes, sir. (heads for door; turns) But I don't learn nearly this much in school.
 BEVERLY / Solve any new problems today?
 WESLEY / I was starting to, maybe, but Mister Singh sent me off to class.
 BEVERLY / Wes -- you're only an acting ensign. (slight smile) You have to let the commissioned officers do some of the work.
 WESLEY / Mom, listen. I've learned more than they understand. For example, on Channing's dilithium crystals theory I was telling you about...
 BEVERLY / (frowns; puzzled) When did you tell me about that?
 WESLEY / This morning. Don't you remember?
 BEVERLY / Honestly, I don't, Wes.
 WESLEY / You asked if the warp engines had to do with navigation, and I said --
 BEVERLY / Why would I have said that?
 WORF / Mister Singh, the Captain wants --
 WORF / (continuing) Engineering to bridge. Security alert!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard.
 WORF / Lieutenant Worf, sir. I just found Mister Singh.... he's dead.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41249.4. Assistant Chief Engineer Singh has been found dead in the Engine Room Office, cause unknown. We continue to run on impulse power.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) I want the autopsy as soon as possible, Doctor.
 TASHA / Captain, I'm so sorry. To have one of our people die like this...
 PICARD / First, let's find out how he died. Doctor?
 BEVERLY / The autopsy is underway, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) It could be... a word you're not to use... (leans in; low voice) ...murder. Status of investigation?
 TASHA / Underway.
 RIKER / Our best people.
 WESLEY / Sir, he may have been working there on restoring warp power.
 GEORDI / (eyes panel; then) According to these readings, we could go back to warp speed now.
 WESLEY / But that wasn't the reading when I left.
 WORF / Singh probably repaired it just before he was killed.
 WESLEY / But he couldn't have fixed it from here, sir! The problems we saw were inside the engines!
 GEORDI / Who else could have corrected it, Wes? (to Worf) Inform the bridge of engine status.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We now have warp capacity, sir. All power on line.
 PICARD / Well done. Warp engines ready. (to conn) On previous heading, warp factor six.
 TASHA / They should. Our delays are your delays.
 TASHA / I must ask where you were during this vessel's Earth hours of 1800 last night and 0700 this morning.
 TASHA / Sir, I'm talking about hours here...
 WORF / You wanted me, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Yes, concerning your memory blackout.
 WORF / (nods) I still don't remember having one.
 BEVERLY / The same thing happened to me.
 TROI / I want to try hypnosis on both of you. It may restore your memory as to what happened.
 WORF / I fear such things, but...
 BEVERLY / Fear from you, Worf?
 TASHA / One thing is clear... Almost all the "peace" delegates answered our questions with lies.
 DATA / Imprecise, Lieutenant. They omitted certain truths, which in itself tells us something.
 TASHA / We can learn something from non-disclosure?
 DATA / Oh, indubitably, my good woman.
 RIKER / It's something the Captain mentioned. Sherlock Holmes, which Data is obviously studying...
 DATA / (interrupting) Has studied, sir - every case. (indicates) As Holmes would have pointed out... during the time in question, something was afoot!
 TASHA / (uncertain of the word) "Afoot?"
 DATA / While both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters, our crew locator sensed them passing here... (indicates) ... and here.
 TASHA / But since they don't show where they went, we're still in the dark.
 DATA / On the contrary, dear colleague - on their return they drew medical supplies appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds and abrasions on these life forms.
 RIKER / Which, leaves you with only one conclusion.
 DATA / Exactly. That they were too engaged in their own affairs to have disabled our ship and murdered the engineer. Given a choice, they'd rather kill each other than any of us. It's elementary my dear Riker...sir.
 TASHA / Speaking of aberrant behavior...
 TROI / Beverly... can you hear me?
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 TROI / I want you to go back in your mind to the moment when you first recall this sensation of memory loss. Please picture it exactly as it occurred.
 BEVERLY / (pause; then:) He's lying on the hospital bed sedated. I'm walking up to him... I--- (distressed) I -- I -- I --
 TROI / Gently...gently. How do you feel at this moment -- as you lean over him to take the specimen?
 BEVERLY / I... feel... someone else... something else there too...
 TROI / (waits; then:) Go on.
 BEVERLY / (frowns, shakes head) I feel crowded. Not alone... get out. Get out of my mind!
 TROI / You said almost exactly the same thing -- as though there were something else inside you.
 TROI / -- Which confirms the feeling of duality that I sensed earlier in both of them.
 PICARD / Why didn't you report it?
 TROI / Because, sir, I assumed at first it was the kind of duality we Betazoids feel in all of you. (sees Picard's expression harden) Even you, sir. When you approach a decision and ask yourself which way to go... who are you talking to?
 PICARD / (beat; his expression still saying "nonsense") Your hypnotism revealed another form of duality?
 TROI / Yes, sir. I believe something invaded them.
 BEVERLY / (nods) It seems the only possible conclusion.
 PICARD / Data, let's proceed without the pipe.
 DATA / If you wish, sir... (sets pipe down) ... but I ask if you take it as incontrovertible that it cannot be a family member or one of our crew?
 PICARD / (beat, considering; then:) Yes. Very unlikely.
 DATA / Then our investigation was worthwhile, sir. We have eliminated both the delegates and all our regular ship's complement.
 PICARD / What are you suggesting?
 DATA / I am referring to the Great Detective's credo, sir. I quote... "We must fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
 GEORDI / Wes, everything's fixed now.
 WESLEY / That engine computer net wasn't repaired, sir. It just suddenly became all right.
 GEORDI / It's the result that counts. (glances down at panel) What --- ?
 WORF / What is it?
 GEORDI / Helm control just went down. (works panel - nothing) She won't respond.
 WORF / Bridge to Captain. You're needed here immediately.
 GEORDI / Wes, alert Engineering from your panel.
 WESLEY / (works panel) Trying...
 PICARD / Report.
 WORF / Helm is down, sir. The ship's running wild ---
 GEORDI / Sir, we dropped to impulse power --
 GEORDI / Sir... ? Are you all right? I thought I just saw ---
 PICARD / I'm fine. (beat) Everything is fine now.
 PICARD / Why the drop to impulse power, Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / (turns to Picard) The helm is suddenly malfunctioning, sir.
 PICARD / Malfunctioning? You're wrong -- Look again.
 GEORDI / (turning to console) Sir, I ---
 RIKER / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / (a beat; puzzled) There's nothing wrong with the helm now. Everything is -- just as it should be, sir.
 PICARD / In that case, make our heading two-nine-five mark three-seven.
 GEORDI / Sir... ?
 PICARD / You have a problem with that heading, Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / Do you want to double back on our course, sir?
 PICARD / That is what I've ordered.
 RIKER / Captain... I'm puzzled about your reversing our course.
 PICARD / The energy "cloud," Commander -- I believe it important to have another look at it.
 RIKER / Sir, we're behind schedule to Parliament already ---
 PICARD / I believe a very important scientific discovery awaits us on this heading.
 TROI / (looks up; beat) Perhaps you'll share your reasoning on that, sir?
 DATA / Yes, since we obtained only minimal information on our sensor pass of it.
 PICARD / We must go back to learn more. (to Troi; thin smile) Counselor... do you believe a ship captain should explain every order?
 TROI / (beat; shakes her head) Of course not, sir.
 SSESTAR / (indicating Badar N'D'D) What is that doing on our deck?
 RIKER / You're late and you asked for this confidential meeting.
 BEVERLY / Sorry. I was just so troubled by my talk with the captain. Something seems wrong... terribly wrong.
 TROI / (hesitant) I believe I sense something ... different in the Captain ... not much and maybe I'm incorrect. (indicates Riker, Data and Geordi) They think I may be.
 RIKER / (to Troi) You could be reacting to the reverse course order.
 GEORDI / But that's our captain. It's not the first time he's done something unusual.
 DATA / A mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny.
 BEVERLY / (to Troi) Exactly what do you believe you're sensing?
 TROI / Exactly? (shakes head) It's difficult to put into words... just a feeling that he's, well... closed part of his mind to me.
 GEORDI / How can you tell there's something there that you can't feel?
 TROI / As I said... it's hard to say. I just feel the captain's become ... perhaps dangerous.
 RIKER / If he's dangerous...if...
 GEORDI / ... he'd have to be relieved from command. (to Beverly) Which you're allowed to do... but it's beaucoup trouble if you're wrong.
 DATA / And at this moment it is all pure speculation. He has done nothing to subject the Enterprise to danger.
 BEVERLY / Besides, I'd need a medical log giving clear evidence of incapacity. (to Riker) You could do it without that problem...
 RIKER / Only if all command officers agreed it vital to do so. But he's not showing overt unusual behavior.
 TROI / Ultimately he will, I believe...
 BEVERLY / Commander, as second in command, it's still in your corner. I'll order medical and psychiatric exams... You'll have to back me up somehow.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, stardate 41249.5. As I believed, the senior command officers refused to relieve the captain from duty on such slender evidence.
 PICARD / Yes?
 BEVERLY / I'd like you to come to Sickbay for some examinations, Captain.
 PICARD / Oh? (nods) I'll be glad to do that when I'm free.
 BEVERLY / I'd like to conduct them now, sir.
 PICARD / Why? (to Riker) What can I do for you, Number One?
 RIKER / Sir, Counselor Troi has recommended the examinations.
 PICARD / (thin smile) Same question. Why?
 RIKER / It is my duty to inform the captain that we believe it possible that he is under some kind of alien influence which... may constitute a danger to this ship.
 PICARD / I consider it equally possible that you two and the counselor are overworked, and possibly suffering hallucinations. (to Beverly) This is an order... you're to arrange medical and psychiatric exams of both yourself and them. Doctor, you realize you're all acting strangely?
 BEVERLY / I'm concerned that you've suddenly turned the ship away from...
 PICARD / (interrupting; hard) What's happened to your mind, Doctor? The search for knowledge is always our primary mission. (stands) I'm sorry but I'm too busy for this kind of nonsense. Must I call security to force you to report to Sickbay?
 RIKER / What in hell... ?
 SSESTAR / Sorry. Wrong species.
 RIKER / Riker to security chief.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Yar here.
 RIKER / Security squad to the Engineering Deck. The Selays are playing hide and seek down here -- obviously with the Anticans -- (rubs throat) -- and it's a lethal game. I want them returned to their quarters under guard.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Right away, sir. (hesitantly) And are you... aware sir, the captain expects you to take a medical exam?
 RIKER / I'll do it later.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / What do you want?
 BEVERLY / I have the results of the exams you ordered.
 BEVERLY / You don't care to inspect them?
 BEVERLY / Please, are you Jean-Luc?
 PICARD / He is here.
 BEVERLY / The Jean-Luc I know?
 PICARD / (nods) And more.
 BEVERLY / The "more" frightens me...
 PICARD / And elates us. We wish you could understand the glorious adventures ahead.
 BEVERLY / You and... ?
 PICARD / Soon we'll both be home.
 RIKER (V.O.) / (troubled) First officer's log, supplemental. On the orders of... Captain Picard, we have returned to the vicinity of the energy pattern "cloud." I am personally convinced that something from this "cloud" now shares...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... the captain's mind. But there seems to be nothing we can do... at least within regulations. There have been no actions warranting relieving Captain Picard. And our medical personnel, while dubious about his condition, are not prepared to certify the captain's incapacity.
 GEORDI / Approaching the "cloud," sir.
 RIKER / Very well, Mister La Forge. Bring us to within ten thousand kilometers and hold us there.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Shall we begin the scientific tests that you wanted, sir?
 PICARD / (smiles) They are already underway.
 PICARD / I have an announcement for the entire bridge.
 PICARD / As many of you suspected... (indicating "cloud" image) ... when our ship passed through the edge of this, it accidentally carried off a sentient being... one much like these energy patterns we're seeing here.
 PICARD / A frightening experience for any intelligent being. As if a great claw reached down and scooped up any of you from your home world. Drawn into the energy pathways of this vessel... (to Worf) ... it found its way to you, Worf, frantic at being carried from its home. Recognizing you as sentient beings, it pleaded for help.
 PICARD / ... but in ways you could not understand... going desperately from one to another of you... then discovering the computer intelligence in the ship's memory circuits. (nods) Simplistic intelligence, but it furnished a way to slow this Enterprise thing that had captured it. (toward Riker) And it very much regrets the accidental death of Engineer Singh during this...
 TROI / (interrupting) Captain, do you exist in combination with the entity?
 RIKER) / Is it in control of you, sir?
 PICARD) / (that smile again) By the time we combined...
 PICARD / ... We had learned much about each other... our passion for exploration... for the unknown. We found we had similar dreams... and it offered your captain a way to realize them beyond any human expectation.
 RIKER / Captain, I must speak to you privately...now.
 DATA / I understand. As an energy pattern free of the limitations of matter... it might travel anywhere, at any velocity...
 RIKER / (angry) Captain, did you hear me?
 DATA / (intent on Picard) Sir, I see no way for you to journey with an energy form.
 PICARD / (ignoring Riker) Isn't there?
 TROI / (reacting to a thought) Maybe... just maybe... (to Riker) He's planning to beam both the entity and himself into that "cloud."
 PICARD / (nods) The transporter need not pattern your captain back into matter... we'll beam energy only...
 PICARD / (ecstatic) ... and we will become... (pleased look) ... a combined energy pattern of that life form.
 PICARD / A resignation from this command and from Starfleet has been appropriately recorded...
 RIKER / (moving in; firmly) I refuse to allow this, sir.
 PICARD / Oh? Under what Fleet regulation? Does this resignation threaten the ship and its company in any way?
 BEVERLY / (moving in) Captain Picard, you are now relieved from duty. I judge you disabled...
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / ... mentally incapacitated...
 RIKER (O.S.) / Security! Help me restrain the Captain... 
 TROI (O.S.) / This is blinding me...
 TASHA (O.S.) / ... Where is he? These light flashes...
 WORF / Captain! I'll help you if you'll let me... 
 RIKER / Hang on to the captain, someone!
 TASHA / The Transporter Chief has no idea of what the coordinates were, sir.
 GEORDI / He's just out there "somewhere?" How can we settle for that?
 RIKER / Give me a choice, then.
 DATA / Still no readings, no sign of anything.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, it's time to set a course for Parliament. Warp eight.
 GEORDI / We're really leaving him... ?
 RIKER / I've waited as long as possible, Lieutenant.
 TROI / Wait! I'm feeling... yes, it's the captain! (concentrating) The captain only. He's out there alone!
 RIKER / The entity... has it abandoned him?
 TROI / Aban... ? No, the combination just wasn't possible out there. (intently; fast) The Captain's in trouble, sir; we must beam him back!
 RIKER / Beam him back as what? He's nothing but energy now.
 DATA / Sir, the entity was caught by the ship's circuitry -- the captain might try to get in the same way if he's in trouble!
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Move the ship in closer!
 GEORDI / Moving in, sir. But where?
 RIKER / No way to know. Let's hope he can come part way himself.
 RIKER / Troi, is there any way you can... "get" a message to him?
 TROI / (shakes head sadly) I wish I could.
 GEORDI / Sensors are monitoring our perimeter, the ship's circuitry... (shakes head) Nothing, sir.
 RIKER / (interrupting) Take us into the edge of it, La Forge.
 WESLEY / Mom, is he gone for good?
 WESLEY) / (continuing) The funny thing is, I... I sort of liked him...
 WORF / Sir! On my sensor controls...
 TROI / Something's here. I can feel it!
 DATA / Just as before! Going to you first, Worf...
 GEORDI / (interrupting) Something crazy on my viewer circuits... (looking toward Viewer) Commander Riker!
 GEORDI / "Static?"
 RIKER / "P" for Picard!
 DATA / He's in the ship's circuitry! Come to the Transporter Room. Please!
 DATA / (continuing) There might be a way, sir! Hurry!
 RIKER / This is a wild theory Data!
 DATA / I knew we had to have the captain's physical pattern here, He was the last one beamed out.
 RIKER / Is what you're thinking possible?
 DATA / Unknown at this time, sir. I hope the captain remembers his pattern is here. (steps back) If he has, his energy has moved into the transporter relays by now...
 RIKER / (nods) Wish we had some sign he's there. (waits; then) We've no choice but to risk it.
 DATA / (nodding) Energizing, sir!
 PICARD / What the devil am I doing here?!
 RIKER / (quietly) Sounds like our Captain...
 DATA / But confused. This Picard-pattern was formed before he went out there...
 PICARD / (to Riker) What's happening to me, Number One? I was ready to beam away... somewhere... I remember talk of an... an entity? But all that seems so vague...
 DATA / (to Riker) I believe the Captain is now his separate self, sir. A lot of what happened is naturally missing...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Data, what nonsense are you talking now? Is it still "Sherlock Holmes?"
 DATA / Ah, yes. Indubitably, sir, indubitably.
 PICARD / (beginning to EXIT) Well, at least get rid of that damned pipe. It smells.
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher asked me to steer you past Sickbay. She says you've looked very tired.
 TASHA / Sorry Commander, but Security Team Two reports they've discovered a puddle of blood outside the Selay Quarters and they can't find one of the delegates and...
 RIKER / (interrupting; annoyed) Lieutenant, couldn't this have waited a moment? We've got the captain back.
 TASHA / (to Picard) Good to see you, sir. The problem is that one of the cooks has just been asked to broil Reptile for the Anticans... and it looks like the Selay delegate...
 PICARD / Riker, with these "peace" delegates and all, I do need some rest. Take charge, Number One.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41255.6. After delivering a party of Earth colonists to the Strnad solar system and providing...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... them with all their basic necessities, we have discovered another Class M planet in the adjoining Rubicun star system.
 PICARD, TROI, WORF and WESLEY on duty with replacement / bridge crew, all examining the planet, as:
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) We are now in orbit there, having determined it to be inhabited as well as unusually lovely. It is...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... a pastoral world, which also shows evidence of learning and civilization. My first officer has taken an away team down to make contact and they are in the process of returning to the ship.
 PICARD / Riker has sounded very enthused in his reports.
 TROI / (nods) He says the planet has life forms almost identical to us.
 BEVERLY / Captain... ! (sees she has interrupted) Sorry, Troi.
 TROI / The Doctor has something much more important on her mind, Captain.
 BEVERLY / (frowns; to Troi) Please, Troi, do not pick up my feelings!
 TROI / Your feelings? All we need are ears.
 PICARD / (smiles to Beverly) You've been talking about it for days now... Shore leave for the crew.
 BEVERLY / I'm tired myself. (to Picard) Establishing that colony has exhausted the entire crew, sir. We're not a supply vessel. Settling all those people was a strain on everyone.
 RIKER interrupts by ENTERING with DATA, GEORDI, TASHA. / They all register enthusiasm, giving the replacement crew nods, smiles, thumbs up gestures as they take over their positions. Riker has continued straight to Picard, acknowledging Troi and Beverly too.
 PICARD / Is it as good as your reports, Number One?
 RIKER / (enthused) Exactly per my reports, sir. Class M, so Earthlike, so beautiful, it will startle you!
 BEVERLY / It sounds wonderful for the children! (to Picard) The Holodecks are marvelous, of course, but nothing like giving them open space and fresh air...
 TASHA / I've listed my report on their customs and laws, sir. Fairly simple, common sense things.
 GEORDI / Wild in some ways, puritanical in others. Neat as pins, ultra-lawful, and making love at the drop of a hat.
 TASHA / Any hat.
 PICARD / (smile) But even the happiest report has its negatives. Let's start with them.
 RIKER / (grins) There are none, sir. Not that any of us can find.
 DATA / But there is a problem here, sir!
 DATA / (continuing) I do not understand this at all!
 WORF / (to Picard) It's the faulty reading I reported, sir.
 TASHA / Sensor technicians are working on it, sir. They've identified it as a "glitch" in the system.
 PICARD / I take it you find no "glitch" at all in this planet, however.
 TASHA / If you approve shore leave, sir, we could start with a small group at first.
 PICARD / Of course... (turns) Wesley, if we go, you will join the away team to evaluate this world as a place for young people to relax.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir!
 PICARD / If all scans and observations confirm the reports... (nods) ... certainly I'll approve it. (beat) Let's hope it is not too good to be true.
 PICARD (V.O.) / We are in orbit of a planet designated Rubicun Three... and have found it to be the home of a life form who call themselves the Edo.
 WORF / Careful, sir...
 RIKER / It's all right, Lieutenant, these are the Edo we met.
 RIKER / They certainly are... fit, right?
 TROI / They certainly are.
 RIVAN /  / Health and happiness!
 LIATOR / A pleasant day to you!
 RIVAN /  / You did return as promised!
 RIKER / Rivan, Liator... (indicating) Also from our vessel is Troi...
 LIATOR / Slowly, slowly... (embraces Troi) I must also welcome this lovely one... (embracing Tasha) ... and this lovely one...
 TASHA / (smiles) My pleasure.
 TROI / Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel mainly happiness and friendship.
 RIVAN /  / And I welcome this huge one... (hugs and fondles Worf) ... oh, yes, yes...
 WORF / (pleased) Nice planet!
 RIVAN /  / But you are a young one. I do not know your custom regarding love.
 WESLEY / Uh... I guess... whatever you usually do...
 RIKER / Others would like to visit here too. If you'll tell us what limits you'd place on the number...
 LIATOR / Whatever pleases you. We can discuss it at the Council Chambers.
 RIVAN /  / (to Riker) Shall we go there now or remain and play?
 RIKER / Play?
 RIVAN /  / At love. Unless you don't enjoy that. (to Worf) Perhaps you do?
 LIATOR / (to Troi) And you? Yes, I can see that you do.
 WESLEY / Listen, maybe I'll just go on ahead...
 RIVAN /  / (indicates Wesley) This is unfair to him. (to Wesley) We'll go to the Council Chambers. You'll find young people your age there.
 WESLEY / (warily) Well... I really can't make any promises...
 LIATOR / (laughs) You don't have to. Our rules are simple. No one does anything uncomfortable to them.
 RIVAN /  / Come! Our people will want to know you.
 LIATOR / Rivan, perhaps they...can't...run.
 WESLEY / (to Riker) Can't run? Sure we can run, right sir?
 RIKER / (to the others) That's the custom here, running... (to Wesley) Right! Lead the way!
 RIKER / "When in Rome... ," eh?
 WORF / When where, sir?
 TASHA / Happiness to you! (to Troi) It's like an "Eden" here.
 RIVAN /  / Good health! I thought you might be out of breath.
 LIATOR / Children, we've brought you a new friend!
 EDO GIRL / Yes, please!
 RIKER / (grins) We may surprise you in a lot of ways.
 RIVAN /  / Everyone! We've brought the visitors!
 LIATOR / (gesturing to away team) Please enjoy what we have!
 DATA / I have traced it through all sensor channels, Captain! It is not a glitch... !
 DATA / (continuing) ... or any other form of error or malfunction, sir.
 GEORDI / Confirmed by my readings, sir. It's like a "shadow something"...
 DATA / Exactly! As if it's not entirely in or out of our dimension.
 PICARD / "What" is, Commander?
 DATA / Whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarm relays, Captain.
 PICARD / Center Main Viewer on that area.
 PICARD / (to Data; continuing) I need more, Commander.
 DATA / Permission to go to hailing frequencies, sir?
 DATA / Hailing frequencies open. On all frequencies and language forms, send... (beat) Enterprise to Object off our starboard bow. Request that you identify yourself!
 GEORDI / Shields and deflectors up full, sir. Main phaser banks ready.
 PICARD / Hailing frequencies? Any reply?
 DATA / (puzzled) It was something unintelligible, Captain. Now running it through our logic and language circuits...
 PICARD / Have a real look at it, Geordi!
 GEORDI / (hurrying for the turbolift) Aye, sir.
 TASHA / Sir, my sensors read it... well, as "half there." And it does look...
 DATA / As if it's partly...transparent.
 PICARD / Data, what the hell is it?
 GEORDI / Lieutenant La Forge to Captain.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, La Forge. What can you make out?
 GEORDI / This is something I've never seen before, sir.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / It's as if it isn't entirely in our dimension, sir.
 PICARD / Anything else?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Negative, sir. It's something I don't understand.
 DATA / (to Picard) I have some information on its first transmission, sir. It translates as... (looks up) ... "stand by."
 CONN CREWMEMBER / Sir! Sensors show something emerging from that... that ship, if you want to call it that.
 DATA / Verified. Something very small...
 DATA / Getting smaller...
 CONN CREWMEMBER / Intruder alert, sir! But I don't... (puzzled) ... show a location...
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Why a tiny swirl of light, Lieutenant? Could you make out anything else?
 GEORDI / (puzzling; looks up) No, sir. Perhaps it is meant to seem "non-threatening" to us.
 DATA / (interrupting) The away team signal has been cut off, Captain! We are no longer in contact with our people!
 CONN CREWMEMBER / Intruder relays do show something...
 PICARD / Why has everything become a something, or a whatever?
 EDOLORD (V.O.) /  / STATE THE PURPOSE...
 EDOLORD (V.O.) /  / (continuing; repeating) STATE... (volume still reduced) STATE THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!
 PICARD / I am Captain Picard, commanding this Federation starship...
 EDOLORD (V.O.) /  / (repeating) STATE THE PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT HERE!
 PICARD / (toward LIGHT SWIRL) We have sent down what we call an away team to make peaceful contact with...
 EDOLORD (V.O.) /  / DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE LIFE FORMS HERE?
 PICARD / No... we are merely visiting here...
 EDOLORD (V.O.) /  / (interrupting) BUT YOU DID MORE AT THE WORLD YOU JUST LEFT. WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR OWN LIFE FORMS THERE?
 DATA / The colony we just planted, sir...
 PICARD / We found that world uninhabited. The life forms we left there... (carefully choosing his words) ... had sought the challenge... (shrugs) ... at least that's the basic reason... had sought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle, a new society there. (beat; explaining) All life on our world is driven to... to protect its own form by re-seeding itself as... as widely as possible.
 EDOLORD (V.O.) /  / DO NOT INTERFERE WITH MY CHILDREN BELOW!
 DATA / Captain... I do not understand how, but it is asking me if I was... constructed for information exchanges.
 PICARD / (hesitates, then) If there... is any way of our learning more about whatever is out there, Data...
 EDO GIRL / I want to do something too! With you.
 WESLEY / (loses smile; warily) Uh... What?
 EDO GIRL / Something you can teach me. Will you?
 WESLEY / Well, actually, there are some games I... uh, don't quite know yet...
 EDO GIRL / It's playing ball. Will you teach me?
 WESLEY / (relieved) Oh, sure. If you have a bat for the ball, I'll show you my favorite. (sees their puzzlement) A bat... (shows measurement) ... a stick or branch, about this thick, this long...
 EDO GIRL / We can get it from the gardens.
 RIKER / (touching his insignia) Enterprise, come in. (waits, then again) Captain, do you read me?
 RIKER / (continuing) Let's... it may be nothing, but let's move our people together.
 WORF / (nods, then) Including the boy, Wesley? He's outside...
 TROI / Is there some problem?
 RIKER / We've lost contact with our ship.
 TROI / (scans room) It's nothing these people have done... I'm certain of that. Their minds are so open...
 RIKER / Help me locate Wes. He's wandered somewhere.
 WORF / If I can take a moment of your time, Lieutenant...
 TASHA / Yes, Worf... but you've got to hear this. (to Liator) Are you telling me that there's no crime here whatsoever? No one breaks any laws?
 LIATOR / (smiles) Once they did. Long, long ago there was much disorder. (smiles; shakes head) But not now.
 TASHA / (to Liator and Rivan) But I've seen no sign of... of police... those who enforce laws.
 RIVAN /  / We have very few. They're called "Mediators." And they are needed only in one place each day...
 LIATOR / The "punishment zone." An area that's selected for a period of time.
 TASHA / It's a completely random selection?
 LIATOR / (nods) No one but our Mediators know what place or for how long. We're very proud of the wisdom of our ancestors. No person ever knows where or when a zone will be.
 RIVAN /  / (smiling too) ... and so no one risks death.
 WORF / (suddenly alert) Death?
 RIVAN /  / (nodding) ... by breaking any law.
 TASHA / Wait, let's explain this...
 LIATOR / (nodding, pleased) Only one punishment for any crime.
 WORF / Anyone who commits any crime in the punishment zone dies!
 LIATOR / (nods) The law is the law. Our peace is built on that.
 TASHA / Even a small thing? Such as ignoring a rule like "keep off the grass?"
 RIVAN /  / (nods; happily) Then no one breaks that rule. Who wants to risk execution? There's always a white wall or fence to remind anyone of a forbidden area like that...
 TASHA / And just who tells visitors of those rules?
 WORF / We'd better find Wesley!
 EDO GIRL / You're very clever at this!
 WESLEY / At home we play a lot of it. (gestures; running ahead) Here, toss the ball ahead of me!
 EDO GIRL / No, Wes...
 WESLEY / (getting up) What's wrong?
 EDO GIRL / Oh, no! Oh, please, no!
 WESLEY / (brushing clothes) I said I was fine. Just some splinters...
 EDO GIRL / (staying back; through tears) He doesn't know; he's from another place.
 RIKER (O.S.) / What's happening here?
 WESLEY / (to Riker) I was chasing a ball... (indicating shed) ... and fell into that. I'm really sorry!
 WESLEY / I'm with Starfleet. We don't lie.
 RIKER / (to Mediators) It won't happen again. We apologize.
 TASHA / Careful, Commander, they've got some strange laws here...
 RIKER / I thought you reviewed the laws here.
 TASHA / But they list nothing about punishment. That's what all this is about.
 WORF / Punishment? If you mean what the others were talking about...
 RIKER / (demanding) What kind of punishment? Name it!
 WORF / Drop that; drop it now!
 TASHA / It's a kind of syringe...
 RIKER / What is this? You said "death;" is it "poison?"
 WESLEY / (disbelieving) He was going to kill me?
 RIKER / Enterprise from away team, come in. (waits) Are you receiving us, Enterprise?
 TASHA / (touching insignia) Urgent, Enterprise. Please respond!
 PICARD / Condition?
 BEVERLY / No sign of consciousness, but the balance of the readings are quite normal for him.
 PICARD / I believe this is some form of information exchange with whatever is over there. At least, I hope that's it.
 BEVERLY / Any communication from our away team?
 PICARD / Something is blocking communication both...
 Reactions from the others to that and to the SOUND of TASHA'S VOICE in mid-message: / 
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / ... Security, urgent. Repeating, Enterprise from away team...
 GEORDI / (interrupting) This is the Enterprise, Lieutenant. We're receiving you now.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / This is an urgent call for Captain Picard.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We may need your presence here, Captain. We have serious trouble with... with a member of our away team and an unusual law they have here...
 PICARD / Captain to Riker, stand by. (to Beverly) Signs of consciousness?
 BEVERLY / None yet. Perhaps in minutes, hours... I don't yet know what's happened to him.
 PICARD / Take him to Sickbay; call me the instant he's awake. (to Geordi) Anything new on that... that thing out there?
 GEORDI / Negative, sir.
 PICARD / Captain to first officer. I'm beaming down.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We have encountered a strange vessel-like object, one with frightening power, which appears to exist partly in another dimension. On the world below...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... what began as a shore leave opportunity among delightful inhabitants of a lovely Earthlike planet... has led incredibly to a death sentence...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... a death sentence proclaimed against... one of our crew members for what our world considers a petty, non-criminal infraction. How can I allow a crew member to die for that? (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / How does the Prime Directive apply to this case? Indeed if we do save our crewmember, how will the frightening object up here react to that?
 PICARD / Care to comment privately how you read any of this...
 TROI / (shakes head) Unnecessary, sir. (indicates) I get strong feelings that they are honest almost to a fault. But they do have great respect, even pride, in their own ways.
 LIATOR / Welcome to our world, Captain. We regret that our system of justice is troubling you.
 PICARD / Wesley Crusher -- where is he?
 RIKER / In accord with the Prime Directive, Captain, I've let them hold him pending the outcome of this.
 RIVAN /  / (gently) He is safe and unharmed. We promise that.
 RIVAN /  / Captain Picard... I do not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice; even if you respect such things...
 PICARD / We do.
 LIATOR / Good, so do we. Our precepts have been handed down from long ago. The tranquility you see in our lives has been made possible by our laws...
 RIVAN /  / We are a people of law. They do sometimes bring us sadness, but we have learned to adjust to that. Perhaps your laws work as well...
 PICARD / They haven't always, but they do now.
 LIATOR / Do you execute criminals?
 PICARD / No... not any longer, that is.
 RIVAN /  / You did once?
 PICARD / Unfortunately, yes. But since then...
 RIVAN /  / (interrupts) And when you did, was it believed necessary to do so?
 PICARD / Can we please get to the facts concerning our crewmember? (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (waits; gets no answer) Yes, some people then felt it was necessary. But we've learned how to detect the seeds of criminal behavior... Capital punishment is no longer justified in our world as a deterrent.
 LIATOR / But you once believed execution necessary. (to Rivan) So, we are not yet as "advanced" as they are. (to Picard) And since you are "advanced" in other ways too, I suggest you use the, ah, transfer device...
 RIVAN /  / "Beam... "
 LIATOR / ... the "beam" device to permit the Wesley boy to escape from us. We will record him as a convicted-criminal out of our reach... (then sarcasm) ... an "advanced" person who luckily escaped the barbarism of this backward little world.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, we have a law ourselves known as the Prime Directive...
 RIVAN /  / (nods) Riker has explained it to us...
 PICARD / Is the boy in the slightest danger from you right now?
 LIATOR / (to Rivan) Until sundown?
 RIVAN /  / (nods; to Picard) Because you are strangers, we are delaying enforcement of the law. But we must act by the time of sundown.
 PICARD / Then, I have another question now, please. While orbiting... while circling high above your world as we do... we encountered a strange object, a "vessel" perhaps? Do you know of such a thing? It was... well, you could say not entirely real, at least not completely what you might call solid...
 RIVAN /  / Do you mean God?
 PICARD / God?
 LIATOR / God is said to be somewhere up there. Protecting us.
 PICARD / Exactly... exactly how would you describe "God?"
 RIVAN /  / (indicating Picard) As you just did. As existing both here and in another place also.
 LIATOR / But when God wants to show its power, it can make itself felt most fully.
 GEORDI / (with a look to Picard) We know.
 PICARD / Picard here.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / CMO Crusher here, sir. Commander Data has just regained consciousness.
 PICARD / What condition? Can he talk?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / He is insisting on it, sir. Urgently.
 PICARD / Stand by; Picard out. (to Troi) I'd rather explain about her son to her personally. (to Rivan and Liator) You promise Wesley Crusher will be safe until sundown?
 LIATOR / (nods) You have our word.
 PICARD / Then, will one of you return with me to our vessel?
 RIVAN /  / (nods) Of course. I'll go as a hostage for the boy's safety.
 PICARD / No, that's not it. I want you to... identify something for me, if you can. (touches insignia) Captain to Transporter Room. Stand by for three to beam up...
 RIVAN /  / I'm...frightened...
 TROI / (touches her gently; smiling) No reason to be.
 PICARD / Transporter Room, energize.
 RIVAN /  / But this is a ... a city. A great city!
 BEVERLY / Captain, I've just seen the away team report about Wesley...
 PICARD / (interrupting; firmly) In a moment, Doctor...
 BEVERLY / (interrupting) "In a moment... "
 PICARD / (icily) Exactly, Doctor, in a moment. (to Rivan; more gently) You were about to say... ?
 RIVAN /  / Since you have all this power, why be concerned about our laws? You could take the boy from us!
 PICARD / (troubled smile) It's not that simple.
 TROI / From here we can view whatever's outside our vessel.
 RIVAN /  / Do you mean my world?! You said we'd be high above it...
 PICARD / (nods) And something else that's up here circling your world too. It's very important to us... perhaps to you... to know what it is.
 PICARD / I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was necessary. Do you know what that is?
 TROI / (waits; then gently) Can you tell us what it is?
 PICARD / Is it "God?"
 PICARD / (continuing) Now, it's very important you answer something. How do you recognize what it is?
 TROI / Nothing will harm you, I promise! Just tell us how you recognize it.
 RIVAN /  / (beat; weakly) It... has appeared...before. It is... the same.
 PICARD / Can you speak to it... Does it speak to you?
 TROI / Captain... !
 EDOLORD (V. O.) /  / RETURN MY CHILD!
 BEVERLY / (to Captain; puzzled) "Return... ?"
 TROI / It's coming toward us, sir... !
 PICARD / Picard to Transporter Room, urgent!
 TROI / Yes, do that! But hurry... !
 BEVERLY / It is still coming toward us...
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Transporter Chief to Captain...
 PICARD / One to beam down to away team location. Hurry!
 PICARD / Engage, Transporter Room, urgent! Engag...
 BEVERLY / What do you intend to do about my son?
 PICARD / He is being held safely, until sundown...
 BEVERLY / When he faces execution! Although he has committed no crime, certainly none that any sane and reasonable person would...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I... apologize, sir... but this is very difficult for me...
 PICARD / You saw what that thing was about to do. I have a ship, an entire crew to consider...
 BEVERLY / If you felt the same, you'd be as frightened and trembling...
 PICARD / (quietly) But I am.
 BEVERLY / Data is in Sickbay here. You'll find him able to talk.
 MEDICAL TECHNICIAN / He's checking out fine, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / (nods) Finish it later, please.
 DATA / I was an excellent choice for them, Captain. They could communicate with me quite... (shakes head) ... I was about to say quite "easily," but there was nothing "easy" about it. Fortunately, they stopped short of overloading my circuitry...
 PICARD / (interrupting) You're saying they. It is a vessel of some sort...
 DATA / (interrupting) Definitely not a single "entity" if that's what you mean, sir... although they know the Edo worship them as a "God thing."
 PICARD / They know... ?
 DATA / (nods) They recognize that this is quite expected and harmless at the present Edo stage of evolution, and...
 PICARD / (interrupting) What kind of vessel?
 DATA / (without pause) It is perhaps not what we'd understand as a "vessel," sir. The dimensions this one occupies allows them to... well, to be in several places at once. But they consider this entire star cluster to be theirs, and it was probably unwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / Of course, there are three thousand four other planets in this general star cluster in which we...
 PICARD / Data, don't babble!
 DATA / "Babble," sir? I am not aware that I ever babble, sir. It may be that from time to time I have considerable information to communicate, and you may question the way I organize it...
 PICARD / Please "organize" it into brief answers to my questions. Do they accept our presence at this planet?
 DATA / Not yet decided, sir.
 PICARD / (waits) Please feel free to volunteer any important information, however.
 DATA / I volunteer that they are now observing us, sir.
 PICARD / To judge what kind of life forms we are?
 DATA / No, it is more curiosity, sir. I doubt they expect us to abide by their value systems.
 PICARD / Do they... know of our Prime Directive?
 DATA / They know everything I know, sir.
 PICARD / And, in your opinion, if we violated the Prime Directive.. ?
 BEVERLY / (interrupting; blurting it) That's not a fair question at...
 PICARD / (to Data) Continue.
 DATA / That would be a case of judging us by our own rules, sir. If we violate our own Prime Directive, they might consider us deceitful and untrustworthy. (beat) You do recall, sir, they cautioned us not to interfere with their "children" below. (looks from Beverly to Picard) What has happened?
 BEVERLY / (exploding) The Edo want to execute my son. (to Picard) I will not allow that to happen, Jean-Luc!
 DATA / Most interesting, sir. The emotion of motherhood, compared to all others felt by humans...
 BEVERLY / SHUT UP!
 DATA / You were right, sir. I do tend to babble.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41255.9. Whatever the object or vessel in orbit with us, it hangs there like a "nemesis". It is one thing to communicate with something mysterious...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... but it is quite another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason that we do?
 DATA / You sent for me, sir?
 PICARD / Let's talk some more, Data.
 DATA / Yes sir. What level of communication?
 PICARD / Any. My apologies for saying you babbled.
 DATA / But I do, sir. (beat) It was wise to beam back the Edo woman.
 PICARD / (nods) Barely in time.
 DATA / (nods) The Edo's "God" is very protective of its children.
 PICARD / There was no choice but to learn... (indicates mystery object) ... what we could about that thing from her.
 DATA / Apparently the Edo people had seen it before, from time to time, sir.
 PICARD / (nods) But I'm sorry I had to. She was so frightened.
 DATA / (nods) Understandable. To share an orbit with "God" is no small experience.
 PICARD / You have a facility for seeing things not in the way we do, but as they truly are.
 PICARD / (continuing) I need help, my friend. I cannot let Wesley or any member of this vessel be sacrificed this way. The Prime Directive does not really intend that.
 DATA / The problem, sir, is there! (indicates mystery object) Although they have learned of the Prime Directive from my mind, how will they evaluate it? How do they reason? What are their values? Remember its warning to us, sir.
 PICARD / Exactly. How do I explain not obeying the laws down there, not permitting young Crusher's execution? Does that endanger this ship and over a thousand other lives?
 DATA / Would you choose one life over one thousand, sir?
 PICARD / (snaps) I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that!
 PICARD / Did you learn anything of the relationship between the Edo and that? Why are they so certain it is "God?"
 DATA / Any sufficiently advanced life form can appear to others to be that, sir. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (looks out toward the Object) But when they were probing my thoughts, Captain, I could feel that whatever they are now, they once existed in this dimension, just as we do. Perhaps also in the same kind of "flesh and blood" form. Since then, however, they have evolved considerably further. Their present existence in mixed dimensions no doubt has advantages we do not understand...
 PICARD / Then, in their earlier flesh and blood existence they could have once shared our kind of values.
 DATA / The Edo share them, sir.
 PICARD / Why would advanced things like that feel obliged to protect the Edo?
 DATA / Perhaps because the Edo are a child-race by comparison. Possibly a race which the life forms over there "planted" here much as we now plant human colonies on Class-M planets.
 BEVERLY / Having fulfilled my professional obligations regarding Commander Data...
 PICARD / You now request permission to beam down -- permission granted. (stands) You can accompany me while I try to resolve this. (starts; then stops and turns) And you should know that whatever the cost, I will not allow them to execute your son.
 BEVERLY / (correctly) Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / (to Data) Take command, Data.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 RIVAN /  / Almost dark. (turns) I want the boy brought here now.
 TASHA / I'll go along with you.
 LIATOR / Of course.
 where several Edo come to their feet in wonder again as PICARD AND BEVERLY BEAM IN. / 
 RIVAN (O.S.) /  / Captain Picard...
 RIVAN /  / I saw you share the sky with God. You must be Gods. (turning to the other Edo, eyes still clenched) And the boy too.
 PICARD / No, no, we're not "Gods." (small smile) Your own idea of that is much better for you at this time...
 WESLEY (O.S.) / (interrupting) Mother...
 WESLEY / (to Beverly) I guess you know a lot has happened here...
 BEVERLY / (nodding; holding it in) I know.
 WESLEY / Are you going to let them kill me, sir?
 PICARD / No. (turning to Liator and Mediators) But I'd like to prevent it in a way you can understand...
 RIKER / (interrupting) We understand. In fact, your system of law and punishment may be better than many we once had. (points at Picard) But he has laws he must obey too. And one of them says he must protect his people from harm.
 LIATOR / We did not ask you to come here...
 PICARD / (nods) Which has to do with another law I must obey. All of us are sworn not to interfere with other life in the galaxy. I am caught between the two. If I save this young man, I break that law...
 PICARD / (nods) I may suffer almost as much. Starfleet takes our Prime Directive very seriously...
 RIKER / (nods) That has crossed our minds too.
 LIATOR / Our laws have been violated. What of justice?
 TASHA / What of justice to Wesley? Does he deserve to die?
 BEVERLY / But my son had no warning...
 RIVAN /  / Is it possible we are wrong about that? Surely there is such a thing as too much harshness...
 TASHA / (calls from entrance) Their sun is almost down, sir.
 PICARD / (to the others) Stand ready to beam out.
 PICARD / The question of justice has concerned me a good deal lately. Pained me. Until now, Liator. I realize now that there can be no justice...
 PICARD / (back to Liator) ... no justice so long as laws are absolute. Life itself is an exercise in exceptions.
 RIKER / (quietly) Bravo. When has justice ever been as simple as a rulebook, sir? (looks around) Six to beam up, Captain?
 PICARD / (touches insignia) Six to beam up.
 RIKER / Main Viewer on!
 GEORDI / Greetings, Jailbird.
 PICARD / Hailing frequencies open.
 TASHA / Open, sir.
 PICARD / To the object sharing this orbit... we will remove the human colonists from the adjoining solar system if signaled to do so. Or we'll proceed on our mission, if signaled to do that. Please tell us...
 DATA / Captain!
 GEORDI / Is that a signal?
 PICARD / (beat) I was hoping for more.
 GEORDI / More of what, sir? I'm happy it's gone.
 RIKER / (nods) We're all thrilled with that, sir.
 PICARD / (beat) I was hoping we'd learn more about it. But since we can't... (looks to Riker) Take us out of here, Number One.
 RIKER / Gladly, sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41723.9. In response to a Starfleet order we are in the Xendi Sabu star system having rendezvoused with a Ferengi vessel which has requested a meeting. Although...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... we arrived here and made appropriate signals to the Ferengi three days ago, they have so far responded only with the message: "Stand by, Enterprise."
 PICARD at his desk, star charts on a nearby monitor. / He's in some physical discomfort, presses his knuckles to his temple, GROANS. We HEAR a CHIME from his door.
 PICARD / Come!
 BEVERLY / You called for me?
 PICARD / Yes, Doctor. I've been feeling... odd, lately. Fatigued. And now I've got a headache.
 BEVERLY / A what?
 PICARD / Certainly you know what a "headache" is, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Of course. But I don't often encounter one.
 PICARD / The reason for it seems fairly obvious. What are these Ferengi up to? "Stand by, Enterprise." Stand by for what?
 BEVERLY / I can't find a thing wrong.
 PICARD / I can't either. But they could be baiting some kind of trap...
 BEVERLY / With your head. I see nothing physically wrong, but I want to run additional scans in Sickbay.
 PICARD / Doctor, all I've got is...
 BEVERLY / (interrupting) ... is an order to report to Sickbay. (friendly smile) From the one person aboard who can give you an order.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain from first officer. They're finally sending a message.
 PICARD / On my way, Number One. (CROSSING to door) Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.
 RIKER, TROI, DATA, GEORDI, TASHA, and WORF are at their / usual stations. Picard ENTERS JOINING Riker at the Command Area. The Main Viewer displays the Ferengi vessel.
 RIKER / They're prepared to talk, sir.
 PICARD / Have they given any hint what they've been waiting for?
 TASHA / Negative on that, Captain. But they have identified their Captain as "Bok," DaiMon Bok.
 TROI / If it's Bok I'm sensing, he seems anxious to meet you, sir.
 PICARD / Me? Why me? I've never heard of him.
 GEORDI / You'll be able to see him now, sir. They're willing to communicate on visual.
 DATA / A reminder of something we learned the only other time we dealt with Ferengi, sir -- their hearing is very sensitive.
 WORF / (nods) Yes, they could pick up even a whisper being transmitted.
 PICARD / Consider ourselves reminded. (to Tasha) Open hailing frequencies.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / Ferengi vessel! This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. We are transmitting visually.
 BOK / Is this THE Captain Picard?
 PICARD / Do we know each other?
 BOK / I know you, Picard.
 PICARD / I'm afraid you have the advantage. Is this... Bok?
 BOK / I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi. I have asked you here to discuss a mutual problem, Captain.
 PICARD / What problem is that, DaiMon Bok?
 BOK / I insist on speaking of that matter in person. Shall we meet on your vessel or mine?
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies closed.
 TROI / Captain, I sense considerable deception on Bok's part. And danger!
 RIKER / Then definitely, sir, you should meet with him here. Keep him under our control.
 TASHA / Now open, sir.
 PICARD / (toward Viewscreen) I appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok, and ask you to be our guests.
 BOK / (smiles) As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this will begin a new era of cooperation for both our peoples. In one Earth hour, then?
 PICARD / One hour, Bok. End transmission.
 WORF / I can't believe they're coming here!
 PICARD / (turns to Troi) They agreed a bit too easily.
 PICARD / (continuing; nods back) Then, in one hour we'll know why.
 PICARD / Are you accustomed to always getting your way, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (nods) When my way makes sense, Captain. There are still forty minutes before the Ferengi beam over; I'll have these scans done in ten.
 PICARD / A lot of effort for something as simple as a headache.
 BEVERLY / "As simple?" It is my job to know your condition intimately. You should not have a headache unless something is wrong.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) It may be true that headaches were once quite common... but this was in the days before the brain was charted... (very puzzled; a new setting) ... before we understood the nature of pain... when we were suffering from such things as the common cold.
 PICARD / And so why do I have a headache, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / I haven't the slightest damned idea!
 PICARD / What's that?
 BEVERLY / Something doctors use when they feel foolish over being proven wrong. (takes device away) Feel better?
 PICARD / (surprised) The pain's gone.
 BEVERLY / Medical fakery -- the pain's actually still there, just cloaked. I'll want further exams when this Ferengi matter is settled.
 Riker, Troi, Data, Geordi, Tasha and Worf on duty as WESLEY ARRIVES by turbolift, hurriedly addresses Riker: / 
 WESLEY / Sir! You'll soon be getting an intruder alert!
 RIKER / What? Wesley, if you've something to report...
 WESLEY / (to Geordi) If you'll scan heading four-four mark one-six-three, Lieutenant, you'll find...
 TASHA / Intruder alert, sir...
 GEORDI / (reading his panel) I've got something, sir... very distant.
 WESLEY / It's an old style starship, Constitution Class, heading this way under impulse power, sir.
 RIKER / Says who?
 PICARD / Carry on. (to Wesley) Answer the first officer's question.
 WESLEY / Uh... says the long distance sensors, sir. I was in Engineering, playing around with boosting sensor output...
 DATA / (interrupting; smiling) Very interesting. Boosting it how? (seeing Picard's look; to Wesley) We will discuss it later.
 GEORDI / (interrupting) I read it now, sir, as... a Constitution Class starship... coming this way under impulse power.
 RIKER / Sir? What's wrong?
 PICARD / (fighting it off) Nothing, just... a mild headache. (to Wesley) The correct procedure, Ensign, would have been to signal your finding to the bridge immediately.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Bringing it here personally... (indicates Main Viewer) ... perhaps with the idea of being on hand for the Ferengi beam over... might have imperiled our ship had something hostile been approaching.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 WORF / We are receiving no signal at all from the approaching starship, sir.
 DATA / (to Picard) Time, sir.
 PICARD / Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam over. (to Riker) Do you see any problems connected with this old starship coming in?
 RIKER / Suggest we'll be safer, sir, with the Ferengi over here whatever is happening.
 PICARD / Concur. (to bridge) Stand by! (to Tasha) Let's bring them on visually.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / Enterprise to Ferengi vessel. We are standing by to receive you.
 BOK / Ready to transfer ourselves over, my dear Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Question... where shall we receive you?
 BOK / On your own bridge, of course. Ferengi efficiency!
 PICARD / Data? What do you read?
 DATA / Nothing, sir.
 WESLEY / It could take a few moments, Captain. If they build up their beaming energy through capacitors as seems likely...
 PICARD / We welcome you in peace to the Enterprise, DaiMon Bok.
 BOK / (ingratiating) It is our pleasure, Captain Picard. Might I introduce my first officer, Kazago, and my second, Rata?
 PICARD / (nods to acknowledge) This is my first officer, Commander Riker... (Bok nods) And Counselor Troi. Second Officer Data; Lieutenant La Forge; security officers, Lieutenant Yar and Lieutenant Worf; Ensign Crusher.
 BOK / Yes, we have heard you use females... (checks them again) Clothed females. Most interesting.
 RIKER / (smiles) They are that, sir.
 KAZAGO / And the android was mentioned too. (to Picard) What is its price? We should like to purchase it.
 PICARD / It... he is not for sale. Commander Data is...is...
 RIKER / You wouldn't want him, Kazago. He's second-hand merchandise.
 DATA / (rises) Second-hand, sir? (then sees Riker's smile) Oh, of course! A human joke...
 TASHA / Excuse, Captain, but the unidentified starship is continuing in, still no signal at all...
 BOK / Think nothing of it.. It is under our control.
 PICARD / (alert) One of our starships under your control?
 BOK / (smiling) Do not be alarmed. It is a gift from us. (slight bow to Picard) With which we honor the "Hero of Maxia."
 PICARD / Who?
 BOK / (abrupt) Why you, Picard, of course! Don't you remember the Battle of Maxia?
 PICARD / I'm sorry, I'm afraid I do not. Data?
 DATA / Captain, he may refer to an incident which occurred seven years ago in the Maxia Zeta star system, where an unidentified starship...
 BOK / (angry) Unidentified?! That fine vessel was Ferengi!
 DATA / (to Picard) Which you destroyed, sir.
 PICARD / (turns to Bok) My sincere regrets, Bok, but that ship did not identify itself. It simply attacked; we defended ourselves...
 BOK / (beat) Such mistakes happen in space.
 DATA / (to Picard) Hardly a "mistake," sir. Your report showed it deliberately attacked...
 TASHA / (interrupting) Do you want the arriving vessel on Main Viewer, sir? It is only a thousand kilometers away now...
 BOK / Put it on your viewer.
 PICARD / (nods to Tasha) Main Viewer.
 KAZAGO / We have set its controls to automatically take station in space next to your Enterprise.
 BOK / (to Picard) There is no one aboard it.
 RATA / (to Picard) When, with your permission, its log will be downloaded into this ship's records. (smiles) At a price...
 BOK / (thunders) No price!
 KAZAGO / (astounded) No price?
 PICARD / For what purpose? What is this all...
 TROI / I felt something too, Captain. What is it?
 RIKER / Sir... ?
 BOK / Perhaps it is... his conscience?
 TROI / (a tigress) Why do you say that?!
 RIKER / Bridge to Sickbay...
 PICARD / (overlapping) No... no, I'm fine...
 TROI / (to Picard; puzzled) It seemed as if... as if it were... something from your past?
 PICARD / I'm all right now; I'm fine. (to Bok; indicating viewer) What is this all about?
 BOK / It is about the battle I mentioned, Captain. A gift in honor of that occasion. Look at that ship closely.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Enlarge please, La Forge.
 PICARD / It... it is the Stargazer. My old ship, but how... where did you find it?
 BOK / It was a derelict, adrift in space on the far side of this star system. How it got there... (grand gesture) ... is none of my business, Captain. But now that vessel is yours, if you wish to have it.
 KAZAGO / (to Bok) We are not selling it to him?
 BOK / Call it an act of friendship.
 RATA / At no cost!? Ugly. Very ugly!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41724.1. Bok and his officers have returned to their vessel, inviting us now to officially take possession of the Stargazer. They will stand by while completing the downloading of its log to us.
 BEVERLY / Like before?
 PICARD / Perhaps... it hit with more impact.
 TROI / "Hit?" (to Beverly) Sorry, but anything could be important.
 BEVERLY / You say you "felt" something yourself?
 TROI / I... believe so. Like... well, a thought... (puzzled) But rather... "mechanical" in nature.
 PICARD / Are you sure it wasn't one of my thoughts? At that moment, I was remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer, a maneuver being made. We were hit... (beat; puzzled) Something's burning... I smell smoke! (pushing at scanner) Don't you smell it?
 BEVERLY / There's nothing burning, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / Ah... no, of course. It was... the memory I was calling up. (finds a smile for Beverly) Sorry.
 TROI / Memory or... "nightmare?"
 PICARD / (smiling again) Well, it was strong, whatever it was. (looks up at Riker) Ready, Number One.
 RIKER / Staff's waiting if Doctor Crusher approves.
 BEVERLY / I'll do better than that -- I'll go along.
 WORF / But if they don't know what the Ferengi are up to, what good is it to sit there guessing?
 WESLEY / Well... sometimes it determines exactly what you don't know.
 GEORDI / Dead on target, my friend. Would you like to go up and listen to them?
 WESLEY / (beat) Some day. Right now I'm happy to be here.
 PICARD / We were traveling at warp two through the Maxia Zeta star system when an unidentified starship suddenly appeared and fired on us! From close range.
 RIKER / Where did it come from?
 PICARD / It must've been lying in a deep moon crater nearby. The first attack damaged our shields, and in the confusion it hit us a second time.
 RIKER / No clue who they were?
 PICARD / No name, no reason... (looks up sharply) Can you identify them, Vigo? Our shields are failing; if they come in again... ?
 TROI / (interrupting) Sir? Who's Vigo?
 PICARD / Ah... my weapons officer on the Stargazer. (weak smile) I was getting caught up in this.
 RIKER / (puzzled for a moment) Then, with your shields failing, sir...
 PICARD / I improvised. With the other ship coming in for the kill... (describes with his hands) ... I ordered a sensor bearing, and when it went into its return arc...
 DATA / ... you performed what Starfleet textbooks now call "The Picard Maneuver."
 PICARD / What any good helmsman could have done. I dropped into high warp... (with his hands) ... then stopped right off the target vessel's bow... (slaps hands together) ... and fired everything I had.
 RIKER / By blowing into warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once...
 PICARD / And our attacker fired on the wrong one.
 RIKER / As you say, "what any good helmsman could have done." (smiles) But you did it first...
 PICARD / A "save our skins" maneuver. The Stargazer was on fire, finished. We had to abandon ship, and limp through space in shuttlecraft for weeks before being picked up. (beat) I haven't thought about it in years...
 DATA / The Ferengi are standing by for us to take possession of the Stargazer, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) I want to go over to her.
 RIKER / (nods) I understand, sir. (smiles) Once my people make certain she's safe.
 DATA / USS Stargazer. Constitution Class. Starfleet Registry NCC 2893...
 GEORDI / I activated the emergency power cells... (looks around) Amazing they still work.
 WORF / The rest of the ship is all clear of surprises, Lieutenant Yar.
 GEORDI / When I read about this ship at the Academy, I never dreamed I'd ever be on her.
 TASHA / (touches insignia) Yar to Enterprise. All clear, sir.
 RIKER / Thank you, Lieutenant. Captain?
 PICARD / Yes, Commander
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Stargazer searched and secured, sir. Give her my best.
 PICARD / I will that, Number One. (to Chief) Energize!
 PICARD / Hello, old friend...
 DATA / You'll find this intriguing, Captain.
 PICARD / What do you find, Data?
 DATA / Last entry was dated seven years ago, sir. By you... (reading) "We are forced to abandon our starship. May she find her way without us." (looks up) Apparently, she did.
 BEVERLY / How are you feeling, Captain?
 PICARD / Fine, Doctor. (to Tasha) Lieutenant Yar, run a structural analysis on the Stargazer for impulse tow. (to Data) Data, download all computers to the Enterprise and file... (to all) I'm going to my old cabin.
 BOK / (to himself) Try this, "Hero of Maxia."
 PICARD / DAMNNNN!
 PICARD / (continuing) OHHHH!
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / Captain?
 BEVERLY / Another headache, sir?! (eyes him) That worries me. I want you back on the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Yes, but... my things here...
 BEVERLY / I'll see they're sent to your Enterprise quarters.
 RIKER / Enterprise now taking possession of Stargazer, Kazago.
 KAZAGO / Permission granted, Riker.
 RIKER / Actually it was quite a bargain, Kazago. I thought the Ferengi always made a profit on things.
 RIKER / Set sub-warp speed for towing, La Forge.
 DATA / Starfleet has responded to our request, sir. A tug will rendezvous with us and tow the Stargazer back to Xendi Starbase Nine.
 RIKER / Very well, Data. (to Picard) How was it, Captain?
 PICARD / (distant) Strange, Number One. Like visiting the house you grew up in, but no one's home, except the phantoms of the past...
 TROI / It has troubled you?
 PICARD / Not as much as this damn headache, Counselor. Take over, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (continuing) What's wrong?
 TROI / I wish I could say.
 RIKER / What is it, Data? Why all the mystery?
 DATA / It is the records of the Stargazer, sir. What the Ferengi call the "Battle of Maxia"... (using monitor) It seems the Captain's personal log contains a much different version of that conflict than the official historic account.
 RIKER / What are you saying?
 DATA / It would appear that the starship which Captain Picard attacked, had in fact, been under a flag of truce...
 RIKER / What?!
 DATA / And apparently, the captain destroyed the ship without notice or provocation.
 RIKER / Impossible. What about the fire aboard the Stargazer?
 DATA / An accident in Engineering.
 RIKER / And the proof?
 DATA / It is logged in his own voice. Would you care to hear it? (no answer) Sir? Sir?
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's personal log, stardate 41724.2. An unexpected discovery made by Commander Data in the downloaded log of the Stargazer...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... appears to indicate Captain Picard was guilty of falsifying the report he made to Starfleet concerning the Stargazer's last voyage.
 PICARD / What does this mean?
 RIKER / I don't know, sir. That sounds like your voice.
 PICARD / Don't you know it is, Number One?
 RIKER / No, sir, I don't. I refuse to believe you could have said that.
 PICARD'S RECORDED VOICE / ... and I admit I must have mistaken their subspace antenna for a weapons cluster. Unfortunately, I fired our main phasers...
 PICARD'S RECORDED VOICE / (continuing) ... and our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel instantly.
 RIKER / I recognize, of course, your voice has been simulated somehow. I've already put Data to work on it.
 PICARD / Thank you, Will. (shakes head) I never made that log entry, of course. But it still creates a duty for you to perform.
 RIKER / Yes, sir, I must report it to Starfleet. But at this distance, it will take at least a full day for subspace communications to reach there...
 PICARD / ... and another full day for their answer to return. I'd like the truth on this by then.
 RIKER / Sir, you can't believe they'd relieve you from command...
 PICARD / Why shouldn't they? Better safe than sorry with the Ferengi now making friendship overtures.
 RIKER / And it's certain that the Ferengi are behind this faked log. No wonder they're still out there, waiting...
 RIKER / (continuing) Headache back, sir?
 PICARD / Damn! (nods) I'll call the doctor again.
 RIKER / It's no wonder you have one, with all this going on, sir. (moving for door) Try to relax. I've got things in hand.
 PICARD / Once again...
 PICARD'S RECORDED VOICE / This is a confession, given by me, Jean-Luc Picard, commanding USS Stargazer, in the hopes that my belated honesty will be taken into account by Starfleet when judging...
 RIKER / La Forge, open hailing frequencies.
 GEORDI / Open, sir.
 RIKER / I'll take it in the Ready Room. (as he EXITS) A secure channel, Geordi.
 GEORDI / Secure, Commander.
 RIKER / Starship Ferengi! This is Commander Riker here. I'd like to speak to First Officer Kazago.
 KAZAGO / A problem, Riker?
 RIKER / Is our channel secure on your end?
 KAZAGO / (pushes o.s. button) It is now.
 RIKER / Are you aware of the details of the Battle of Maxia?
 KAZAGO / Captain Bok has just made me aware of it, Riker. The infamy of your Picard is now fully known.
 RIKER / Infamy?!
 KAZAGO / I would call the wanton destruction of an unarmed vessel infamy.
 RIKER / And if I produce evidence that Captain Picard's log entry was falsified to indicate that... ?
 KAZAGO / What else would your decadent culture say to defend such disgrace?! But I can hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss an ancient battle. (impatient) What do you want of me?
 RIKER / Just one question.
 KAZAGO / As you humans say, I'm all ears.
 RIKER / First officer to first officer, Kazago, if your Captain Bok knew of that, why this peaceful meeting to present us with the Stargazer?
 KAZAGO / We freely give YOU back your derelict warship and now you accuse US of crime, Riker?! (amazed) I can bear NO more insults!
 PICARD / Who the hell is it?!
 BEVERLY / Not resting, Captain?
 PICARD / More like dying, Doctor. What's wrong with me?!
 BEVERLY / I wish to hell I knew, Captain. But something unusual has definitely happened to you.
 PICARD / Why do doctors always state the obvious like it's a revelation?
 BEVERLY / Why do captains always think they're immortal? (reads band) Better now?
 PICARD / Aghhh! My head!
 BEVERLY / (tabs it higher) Now that has to do it right?
 PICARD / No!
 BEVERLY / You didn't say it's been this bad!
 PICARD / It hasn't been! But it is getting worse, Doctor...
 BEVERLY / It has to be some kind of emotional pressure connected with the Stargazer...
 PICARD / I got the damn headache before I even knew my old ship still existed... (pain easing) But maybe you're partly right...
 BEVERLY / Want to talk to Counselor Troi about it?
 PICARD / (pain again) What I need now is a friend...
 BEVERLY / (quietly) I'm here.
 PICARD / (eyes CLOSE) The Stargazer was an exploration vessel. The fight at Maxia was not my first action, but it was the first time I ever killed anyone.
 BEVERLY / You had no choice...
 PICARD / Didn't I? I don't know anymore... I just don't know.
 BEVERLY / Commander Riker told me about the altered log, sir. If that's troubling you...
 PICARD / (ignores her) The last three nights, I... hear voices. I'm standing on the bridge, fire all around me... the klaxons, smoke, and I give the order... (amazed) And now the Stargazer is really here! (back to her) And that log... Am I going crazy? How do I know if I was in my right mind at Maxia? How do I know if I'm in my right mind now?
 PICARD / What was... that?
 BEVERLY / Just something to let you sleep.
 PICARD / (already working) Yes... sleep... I need sl...
 BOK / (to himself) And now, dear captain, you are ready to live the past!
 BOK / (to himself) You will injure yourself as once you injured me!
 PICARD / (normal volume) Damage report!
 PICARD / Sensor bearing on hostile ship!
 PICARD / Ready phasers, and lock! (MOVES ACROSS room) Stand by for warp nine, heading seven, seven mark twenty... (another room position) And ENGAGE!
 PICARD / Steady. NOW reverse and stop! (goes for it) Phasers FIRE! Torpedoes AWAY!
 PICARD / Fire!
 PICARD / FIRE!!
 DATA / By comparing the main Stargazer computer log with Captain Picard's personal log, I have found "checksum" discrepancies, sir.
 RIKER / What does that mean?
 DATA / All information is time-coded by entry, and the bits when totaled produce an aggregate amount which...
 RIKER / (interrupts) I don't want a lesson in computer science! Bottom line?
 DATA / One of these two logs is a forgery.
 GEORDI / (smiles) Correction -- the log just found aboard the Stargazer is a forgery.
 DATA / As I said. That is one of them, isn't it?
 GEORDI / You're looking better, Captain.
 PICARD / A little sleep, thanks to the doctor, works wonders. Any report on the logs?
 DATA / Yes, sir. Whoever tampered with your personal log was clever...
 GEORDI / ... but slightly clumsy. There's no doubt it is a fabrication.
 BEVERLY / Number One, we think you should see this brain scan graph which... (sees Picard) What are you doing here?!
 PICARD / (amused) I thought I was captain of this starship, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Of course you are, but I...
 PICARD / Thank you for your confirmation of that. (includes the others) But now, except for Commander Riker, I want you all back at your stations... (emphatic) Is that clear?
 BEVERLY / (indicates report) I have some business concerning your health, sir...
 PICARD / (interrupting) I mean you too, Doctor. I have business with Riker.
 BEVERLY / Under protest, Captain.
 RIKER / You have orders for me, sir?
 PICARD / Release the Stargazer from the tractor beam, Number One.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / The tractor beam.
 RIKER / Sir, are you abandoning...
 PICARD / (interrupting) No. Her inertia will carry the Stargazer along on this heading with us. Or did you sleep through the Academy lecture on conserving tractor beam power?
 RIKER / No, sir. I'll release her, or course.
 BEVERLY / Obviously, there is some thought process disorder here but I cannot find any physical reason for it. (turns to Troi) Anything?
 TROI / I'm puzzled too. I keep sensing random thoughts... but two sets of them. As if they were his, but intermixed with his from another source.
 BEVERLY / I'm busy at the moment, Wesley...
 WESLEY / I know you're busy, Mom, but when I went back to the main sensors in Engineering to try some more sensitivity experiments...
 BEVERLY / (interrupting) Wes! I'll be glad to hear about it when I'm through with...
 WESLEY / (interrupting) But, Mom, this is important!
 TROI / Does it have something to do with Captain Picard?
 WESLEY / Yes, ma'am... (indicates scans) ... if that's what you're talking about there. I don't know anything about brain scans but I glanced at these when you were studying them, Mom, and I noticed... (MORE)
 WESLEY (Cont'd) / (pointing at scan graphs) ... these patterns here were like patterns of the low-intensity transmissions picked up from the Ferengi ship. (nods) I just went back and checked and they're exactly the same.
 TROI / (beat) What kind of transmissions?
 WESLEY / I don't know. Engineering has nothing like it on record.
 TROI / (to Beverly) Let's get to the captain...
 BEVERLY / No, they might be affecting the captain. To Riker!
 WESLEY / You're welcome, ladies. (shaking his head) Adults!
 BEVERLY / The captain, Commander?
 RIKER / Resting in his quarters... (meaningfully) ... after ordering both of you to your duty stations.
 TROI / This is more important!
 RIKER / (cocks an eyebrow) Than the captain's orders?
 BEVERLY / Yes, when we have reason to believe his judgment is being affected.
 RIKER / Well then, why not let everyone in on it?
 TROI / It affects them too. There have been some strange... (to Beverly) Did he say "low intensity... ?" (gets a nod) ... unusual low intensity transmissions from the Ferengi vessel...
 RIKER / Did who say?
 BEVERLY / My son!
 BEVERLY / (continuing) ... transmissions which exactly match certain anomalies found in the captain's brain scans. (looks up) Something over there is affecting Captain Picard's thought patterns.
 RIKER / Computer, tell me Captain Picard's location!
 RIKER / What? Computer, emergency order to Transporter Room Three...
 BOK (O.S.) / Welcome back, Captain.
 PICARD / (swivels, stands) What is happening?
 BOK / (to Com) Shields up, computer.
 PICARD / What are you doing?
 BOK / (laughs) Collecting on an old debt...
 PICARD / (throbbing pain) AGHHH-H-H!!
 RIKER / Stargazer! Respond, Captain!
 TASHA / (checks board) Shields up, sir. No way to beam over help.
 GEORDI / I am reading something very strange. A low intensity beam of intermittent pulse inside this starship.
 DATA / I have a fix on it... (surprised) Inside Captain Picard's quarters.
 TASHA / (to Worf) You transferred some of his belongings from the Stargazer... ?
 WORF / (nodding; to his feet) Including a fairly heavy chest... !
 RIKER / Go take a look, fast!
 GEORDI / (indicating Main Viewer) The Stargazer is powering up!
 BOK / I have been waiting a long seven years for this, Picard!
 PICARD / I have no idea what you're talking about...
 BOK / Do you not, hu-man? Can you not remember the crime you committed against my very blood? (Picard is stumped) You murdered my only son!
 PICARD / Your son?
 BOK / He was the commander of the ship you destroyed!) (pained) On his first voyage as DaiMon.
 PICARD / The ship... ? The... the Ferengi ship that attacked me... (looks around) ... or is it about to attack me?
 BOK / And I have spent these years searching... seeking... a proper blood revenge. And I found it!
 PICARD / OHHHHH... ! OHHHHH... !
 BOK / (eyeing device) From a distant world which hu-man evil has not yet reached. May you never secure these! I am rich, yet two of these cost me the profits of an entire life.
 PICARD / You cannot... control me like...
 BOK / Die well, Picard.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, stardate 41724.3. Captain Picard, without explanation, has beamed himself to the Stargazer which is now moving away from us...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... under its own power.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 RIKER / Enterprise to Stargazer, please respond.
 RIKER / (continuing) Enterprise to Stargazer... to Captain Picard aboard Stargazer, please answer. (waits; to Data) Mister Data, what was Stargazer's condition?
 DATA / Considerable fire damage to interior surface as reported, sir. But none of her main systems are crippled.
 RIKER / (hates to ask) Armaments, Lieutenant Yar?
 TASHA / Six photon torpedoes short, sir, probably used when the Captain destroyed his Ferengi attacker seven years ago. Otherwise fully armed.
 RIKER / Where in the Captain's quarters was it, Mister Worf?
 WORF / His chest from the Stargazer, sir. Just where I had left it -- he hadn't yet unpacked.
 BEVERLY / So, he may not have even known it was there. And if this is able to pick up or magnify a thought-altering transmission...
 TROI / (nodding) ... it could have prepared him for whatever's happening now.
 RIKER / Let's find out... or try to. (turning to Tasha) Contact the Ferengi vessel, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / (touching panel) Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 RIKER / Enterprise to Ferengi vessel, we transmit visually. Do you respond?
 The Main Viewer shifts to an ANGLE ON FERENGI VESSEL which in turn DISSOLVES INTO A VIEW OF FIRST OFFICER KAZAGO, who looks somewhat annoyed. / 
 KAZAGO / Why is our gift to you under power, hu-man?
 RIKER / I'll discuss that with your captain.
 KAZAGO / He is working in our ship's laboratory. Where is your captain?
 RIKER / (beat) He's beamed himself aboard the Stargazer, and I'm wondering... (brings sphere up into view) ... if this has anything to do with it?
 KAZAGO / How do you have possession of that?
 RIKER / It was found in our captain's belongings, brought over from the Stargazer.
 KAZAGO / It... is a forbidden device. A Thought Maker. If your captain is... criminal enough to own one...
 RIKER / (interrupting) Kazago, I ask again, first officer to first officer... what is going on? Something is happening that neither of us seems to know about.
 KAZAGO / (beat; hesitant) It... is not seemly to question one's own DaiMon, Riker. I... am not prepared to do that...
 TASHA / (overlapping; to Riker) Sir... I have the Stargazer.
 RIKER / Switch now!
 RIKER / Captain Picard, this is the Enterprise, sir...
 PICARD / (not understanding) Do not attack again! We are on a peaceful...
 TROI / He's living a delusion, sir. He's seeing things we don't...
 PICARD / Give your identity! You force us to defend ourselves! (turning; shouting) Phasers full up! Arm torpedoes! Why aren't shields at full power... ?
 TASHA / We've lost him, sir...
 GEORDI / When he put the shields up...
 PICARD / Damn, I said... (flicking switches) ... put fusion generators on surge control. (to another panel) You're moving too slowly. Arm the torpedoes, man!
 PICARD / (continuing) Vigo! Get a fire control party up here!
 PICARD / Weapons report!
 PICARD / Who are they? Identify them!
 TROI / I can now feel anger from our captain, first officer. Frustration over whatever he is re-living...
 GEORDI / The Battle of Maxia, sir! That's all it can be.
 RIKER / Mister Data?
 BEVERLY / What is that "maneuver" he became famous for... ?
 RIKER / (overlapping) The Picard Maneuver! (whirling) Mister Data, what is the defense against that?
 DATA / There is no defense, sir.
 RIKER / Then devise one! Fast!
 KAZAGO / First Officer Kazago to hu-man Riker.
 RIKER / Not now, Kazago!
 KAZAGO / We do not wish to become involved in what has become clearly a Federation matter...
 RIKER / Fine, fine, Enterprise out!
 KAZAGO / But you should also know that DaiMon Bok no longer commands this vessel, Riker. His first officer has confined him for engaging in this unprofitable adventure. (nods) Good luck, First Officer Riker.
 DATA / I have computed a possibility, Commander. Since even deep space contains trace gases, sir, a vessel in the Picard maneuver might seem to disappear, but our sensors could locate any sudden compression of those gases...
 RIKER / (hurried) And use it as an aiming point? Blast our own captain to bits?
 DATA / Aim our tractor beam at it, sir! Seize it! This class starship has enough power for that.
 RIKER / (fast) In our captain's words... make it so! Set sensors, tractor beam... (waiting) I hope you're right, Data...
 DATA / No question of it, sir...
 RIKER / Stand by!
 RIKER / Lock on tractor beam!
 PICARD / Ready phasers!
 RIKER (V.O.) / Captain Picard, listen to me!
 PICARD / Is that you, Vigo?
 RIKER (V.O.) / It's Commander Riker, sir!
 RIKER / (continuing) Captain, hear me! Look around you, the Ferengi are using a thought device on you...
 PICARD / Stand by for warp... (inner conflict) Who are you?!
 RIKER / It's Riker, sir. Your Number One. Look for a silver sphere...
 RIKER / (continuing; sees it too) There it is! Destroy it with your phaser, Captain!
 PICARD / Phaser... (glances back) Yes, a sphere... Bok used it...
 RIKER / Destory it!
 PICARD / (fumbles in pocket) Phaser... destroy the sphere.
 RIKER / Captain! Are you all right?
 PICARD / Enterprise, lock on. Beam me home, Riker.
 BEVERLY / Include a burn unit with each kit. On arrival, identify the most critically injured and beam them up to Cargo Bay Six...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (interrupting) Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain.
 BEVERLY / (touching wall panel) Doctor Crusher here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Additional information. The number of colonists at the site is five hundred-four - including thirty-eight children.
 PICARD is in his Command chair, TROI to his left. WORF / at the Aft Station. GEORDI has the Conn, DATA on Ops. TASHA at Tactical. / 
 PICARD / So far nothing more than the initial message. Explosion - cause unknown - many injured. Are you prepared, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / We believe so, sir.
 GEORDI / Captain, we are now at warp nine point one.
 DATA / Which will bring us into the Quadra Sigma System in three point two hours.
 RIKER / Captain, I have a schematic of the explosion site. It suggests the cause as a methane-like gas seeping in underground...
 TROI / (with alarm) Captain, I am...
 TROI / I am sensing what we encountered months ago...
 DATA / The "Q" Entity, sir? It is identical to the grid we encountered when...
 WORF / It reads solid, sir. If we hit it... !
 PICARD / Not now, damn it, "Q"... (to Helm) Emergency full stop!
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 TASHA / Shields and deflectors, up, sir.
 GEORDI / Now reading full stop, sir.
 "Q" (V.O.) / (amplified and powerful) Humans, I thought by now you would have scampered back to your own little star system.
 PICARD / (waits, then) If this is "Q" I'm addressing, our vessel and crew are on a mission of rescue where a group of badly injured...
 "Q" (V.O.) / (interrupting) We of the "Q" have studied our recent contact with you... and are impressed. We have much to discuss, including perhaps the realization of your most impossible dreams.
 PICARD / (sarcastically) However intriguing we may find that to be, we are now in the midst of an urgent journey. Once we have completed that...
 "Q" (V.O.) / (louder; angrier) You will abandon that mission, Captain. My business with you takes precedence!
 "Q" (V.O.) / If my magnificence blinds you, then perhaps something more familiar...
 WORF / Damn, the phasers are useless!
 PICARD (V.O.) / "Q", STOP THIS! / 
 PICARD / Stop this and we agree to talk for a moment!
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / Starfleet Admiral "Q" at your service!
 PICARD / You are not a Starfleet admiral, "Q"... / 
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / Neither am I an Aldebaran serpent, Captain. But you accepted me as such.
 RIKER / He's got us there, Captain.
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / (nods) The redoubtable Commander Riker whom I noticed before. You seem to find this amusing.
 RIKER / I might, if we weren't trying to rescue a group of suffering and dying humans who...
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / Your species is always suffering and dying...
 PICARD / (interrupting) No, Lieutenant Worf... !
 PICARD / You'll make no move against him unless I order it.
 "Q" smiles toward Worf. / 
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / Pity. You might have learned an interesting lesson. Tsk, a macro head, a micro brain.
 PICARD / "Q", you said you had the / realization of "some impossible dreams" to offer us. Once this rescue is complete, I'll listen seriously to whatever proposal you wish to make and then, subject to it being acceptable...
 "Q" bursts into what sounds like genuine LAUGHTER. / 
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / "... subject to" your foolish human values? Picard, why do you people distrust me so?
 DATA / Sir, if...
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / Yes, Captain, it is best they don't answer that. But you... you, Picard, I grant the freedom to answer me honestly. Why do you distrust me so?
 PICARD / "Q", right now humans may be / dying because you...
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / (angry now) SPEAK! Why do you distrust me?
 PICARD / (beat) Why? On our first meeting, "Q", you seized my vessel, condemned all humans as savages and on that charge, you tried us in a post-atomic twenty-first century court of horrors where you attacked my people... then you again seized my vessel...
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / How that angers you: "Seized my vessel, seized my vessel... "
 PICARD / (without pause, ignoring this) ... and then proceeded to interfere with our Farpoint mission, threatening to convict us as ignorant savages if, in dealing with complex and powerful life-forms, we made the slightest error... and when you failed even there...
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / (interrupting) At that point, the "Q" became interested in you. (turns to include bridge crew) Cannot some of you understand your incredible good fortune?! (to Picard, mimicking) "Seized my vessel, seized my vessel... " The complaint of a closed mind too accustomed to military privileges. (to Riker) But you, Riker, and I remember you well, what do you make of my offer?
 RIKER / I stand with my Captain.
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / (smiles) Of course, you do. Commendable loyalty. (indicating bridge crew; to Riker) And what of these others? Since humanity now interests us, how shall we come to know them better?
 RIKER / We don't have time for these games.
 "Q" (ADMIRAL) / Ah, yes! A game... for interest's sake, a deadly game. To the game!
 DATA / Obviously a Class-M world, gravity and oxygen within our limits...
 GEORDI / ... but a twin sun? Where are we?
 DATA / Considering the power demonstrated by "Q" the last time... Anywhere! Assuming this place even exists.
 RIKER / But this won't be boring. If "Q"'s anything, he's imaginative. / (to the others) Apparently the captain wasn't meant to be with us here.
 TASHA / (overlapping) Sir! Over here... !
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Join me, Riker. A good game needs rules and planning...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / (continuing) Wasn't it your own Hartley who said "Nothing reveals humanity so well as the games it plays?" (smiles; nods) Almost right. Actually, you reveal yourselves best in how you play.
 DATA / Sir, what he has in mind could provide us with vital information.
 TROI / (registering surprise) What I sense is... pleasure, sir.
 RIKER / Incredible. I was just thinking of an old-fashioned lemonade...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / ... and so it became that. An excellent thirst quencher; it becomes quite hot out on this plane.
 RIKER / What about my people?
 "Q" makes a waving gesture. / 
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Whatever they want, of course!
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / The rigid Klingon code! Drink not with thine enemy! (to Riker) Which explains something of why you defeated them.
 RIKER / Still arguing the human past? Perhaps you're not that original.
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Au contraire! It is the human future that now intrigues us... and should concern you most. Of all species, yours cannot abide stagnation... change is at the heart of what you are. But change into what? That's the question!
 DATA / That is what humans call a truism.
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / (annoyed) Meaning "hardly original"...
 RIKER / (hint of humor) You're the one who said it. And while we're at it... (indicating "Q"'s uniform, tent) ... this isn't part of any human future...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / True, I borrowed this from your stodgy captain's mind. It is dressing for the game we will play and games require boundaries, dangers, rewards, familiar settings, that sort of thing.
 RIKER / It's not that familiar to me... (calls) Data?
 DATA / (stepping in) It is from Europe's Napoleonic Era, sir, late eighteenth, early nineteenth centuries. This is a campaign headquarters tent, his uniform is that of a French Army marshal, the...
 RIKER / (to "Q") And a marshal outranks even an admiral...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Would I go from a Starfleet admiral to anything less?
 RIKER / (hint of a smile now) Of course, you wouldn't. (indicates) But Napoleonic equipment on an alien planet with dual suns... ?
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / As you've said, I'm nothing if not imaginative. And the game should reflect that. Shall it be a test of strength? Meaningless, since you have none. A test of intelligence? Equally meaningless... (eyeing Riker) A game needs risk... Something to win; something to lose.
 RIKER / If we must play a game, what would we win?
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / The greatest possible future you can imagine! (beat; thinking) Which, of course, requires something totally disastrous if you lose! (thinking again) The point of this game will be whether any of you can stay alive.
 WORF / If your "game" is fair, we will.
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / For shame, Lieutenant Worf. Fairness is a human concept. (to Riker) Think imaginatively! It will, in fact, be completely unfair...
 TASHA / You've gone too far.
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Game penalty!
 RIKER / Where is she, "Q"? You can forget your game if...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / To use a twentieth century term, Commander, she's in a... a "penalty box." Where she can remain unharmed unless one of you merits a penalty. (smiles) Unfortunately, there is only one penalty box. If any of you should be sent there... dear Tasha must give up the box to you.
 GEORDI / And... where does she go?
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / (to Geordi) Into "nothingness." (looking to the Others, individually) I entreat you to carefully obey the rules of the game. The only one who can destroy your Tasha now... is you.
 PICARD / Turbolift Control, do you read? This is the captain.
 PICARD / (continuing) Engineering, this is the bridge.
 PICARD / (continuing) Security -- this is the Captain.
 PICARD / (continuing) Computer? (waits) Computer on!
 PICARD / (continuing) Captain's log...
 PICARD / (continuing) Damn... I can't even make a log entry.
 TASHA (O.S.) / I wish I could help you, Captain.
 PICARD / What... what are you doing here?
 TASHA / I... well, this sounds strange, but... I'm in the penalty box.
 PICARD / You're what?!
 TASHA / (tightly) In "Q"'s penalty box. As I said, it sounds strange but it definitely isn't. Somehow I know that one more penalty... by me or anyone... and I'm gone.
 PICARD / Gone?
 TASHA / (distraught) Please do not keep reminding me...
 PICARD / I'm sorry...
 TASHA / (instantly) No, I'm sorry. It's so frustrating to be controlled like this...
 PICARD / Lieutenant...Tasha... it's all right...
 TASHA / (astonished and angry) What the hell am I doing? Crying?
 PICARD / Don't worry. There's a new ship's standing order. (smiles) When in a penalty box, some tears are permitted.
 TASHA / Captain... if you weren't a captain...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) (O.S.) / (interrupting) Consorting with lower rank females, Captain?
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Destructive to discipline, they say. But you are, after all, only human, eh?
 PICARD / A marshal of France? Ridiculous!
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / One takes what jobs he can get. For example, your log entries. (MORE)
 "Q" (Cont'd) / (looks up) Starship log, stardate today... This is "Q", speaking for Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who we consider too bound by Starfleet custom and tradition to be useful in this activity.
 PICARD / But who proved himself a resourceful opponent when he defeated you at Farpoint.
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / (with "log" tone again) The Enterprise is now helpless, stuck like an Earth insect in amber while its bridge crew plays out a game whose real intent... (aiming this at Picard) ... is to test if their first officer is worthy of the greatest gift the "Q" can offer.
 PICARD / So, you're taking on Riker this time. (smiles) Excellent! He'll defeat you just as I did!
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / A wager on that, Captain? Your command of this starship against... ?
 PICARD / Against your staying out of humanity's path... forever! Done?
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Done! (smiles) And you've already lost, Picard. You see, Riker is to be offered something impossible to reject.
 "Q" storms toward the Ready Room. / 
 RIKER / Geordi, can you still see Worf?
 GEORDI / (nods) I'd see the freckles on his nose, if he had them, sir. He's at the third ridge now...
 TROI / The third ridge... ?
 GEORDI / Moving well. (distracted) Oh, oh! (peers) Good, he sees them. They look like sentries, sir.
 PICARD / "Q", listen to me. You seem to / have some need of humans...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / Or concern regarding them.
 PICARD / Whichever it is, why try to solve it through this confrontation with us? Why not a simple direct explanation, a statement of what you seek? Why these games?
 "Q" turns and WE SEE he is holding Picard's complete / works of William Shakespeare. He indicates the books.
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / I'm surprised you have to ask when your human Shakespeare has already explained it so well.
 PICARD / Indeed he did, "Q". But careful you don't depend too much on any single viewpoint he...
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / (ignoring this; interrupting) Why these games I require of you? A pity you're not familiar with the contents of your own library. Hear this, Picard, and reflect. (lifts book, quotes from it) "All the galaxy's a stage, and... "
 PICARD / (interrupts) "All the galaxy?" "All the world's a stage... "
 "Q". (MARSHAL) / Oh, you know that one? Then how about, "... Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
 PICARD / And so you say, how we respond to a game tells you more about us than our real life, a "tale told by an idiot." (still amused) Interesting, "Q".
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / (lifts book) Shall I quote from Hamlet?
 PICARD / No. I know Hamlet. And what he said with irony I prefer to say with conviction. (quoting) "What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty. In form, in moving, how express and admirable. In action, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god... "
 "Q" (MARSHAL) / (upset; interrupting) You don't really see your species like that?!
 PICARD / I see us one day becoming that, "Q". Is that what concerns you? / 
 "Q" comes angrily to his feet, SLAMMING the volume down / and DISAPPEARING in a FLASH. A startled and puzzled Picard watches him go, then turns to ponder the meaning of "Q"'s anger.
 RIKER / Can you still see Worf?
 GEORDI / (shakes head) It's hard to keep him in sight, sir. But the soldiers there... they've formed a "skirmishing line," I think you'd call it... and they're headed this way.
 RIKER / Carrying ancient powder and ball muskets?
 GEORDI / That's what their weapons look like, sir.
 DATA / Muskets are appropriate to the 1790 - 1800 French army uniform. (shakes head) But it is hardly a "weapon" by our standards, sir. A lead ball propelled by gunpowder -- one-hundred meters at most with any accuracy...
 GEORDI / Against phasers? Just one of our hand phasers could finish off an entire regiment of them.
 RIKER / Except for one thing... (to Troi) That hardly sounds like "Q", giving us an advantage like that. (puzzling; then REACTING) Unless...
 WORF / (growling it) DROP YOUR WEAPONS!
 RIKER / (exhibits hand phaser) I'm afraid it was me, Worf. Making certain our phasers still operate.
 WORF / A warrior's reaction.
 GEORDI / Incredible, Worf! You came out of nowhere!
 RIKER / (to Worf) Report. What did you find?
 WORF / Sir... what they're wearing may be old Earth uniforms, but what's inside those uniforms isn't human at all. More like vicious animal things.
 GEORDI / Oh, oh! Good old "Q". But how can even the most savage animal forms threaten us if they're armed with the equivalent of popguns?
 GEORDI / They're moving in fast, sir.
 RIKER / Data, if you've got a theory on what's happening...
 "Q" (DATA) / Think fast, Commander Riker. (REACTING; pointing) And move fast... !
 "Q" is pointing at two of the fierce-looking Animal / Things in French uniform that have moved INTO SIGHT, aiming their "muskets" at Geordi who jumps behind a rock. TWO PHASER BLASTS. The first hits a rock near Geordi. The second BLASTS A BROAD FURROW in the desert floor.
 RIKER / That's no "musket!"
 "Q" is REACTING to the uniformed Animal Things seeing / them now, swinging its weapon in their direction. Riker spins, FIRES HIS PHASER, DEMATERIALIZING both his opponents.
 RIKER / (anxiously) Troi, Geordi, Worf... !
 "Q" pulls him down as: / 
 "Q" (DATA) / You have only one chance to save them, now. Send them to your ship!
 RIKER / You'll let me beam them?
 "Q" (DATA) / (shakes head) Send them the same way as I do. I've given you that power.
 "Q" (DATA) / (continuing) Do you understand? I've given you the power of the "Q". (demonstrates with sweeping gesture) Use it!
 "Q" (V.O.) / (echo chamber) Use your power!
 PICARD / Take the Conn, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / Engineering -- this is the bridge.
 PICARD / Are all systems back on line?
 TASHA / Captain, you had better look at this.
 TASHA / There has been no interruption in course or speed. Both have remained constant. Captain -- it's as though we never stopped.
 PICARD / We never did. "Q" suspended time.
 TASHA / Where's Commander Riker?
 WORF / He was with us.
 GEORDI / He must still be on the planet. (to Picard) We were under attack by... by animal things...
 PICARD / Animal things?
 GEORDI / Animal things in uniform, sir... (quails at Picard's expression) Which I think Data could probably explain better, sir.
 DATA / You may find it aesthetically displeasing, sir. I could just file a computer report on that...
 TROI / (interrupting) Sir, the important thing right now is why is Commander Riker missing?
 PICARD / Understood, Counselor, but Will is almost certainly safe... (troubled) ... at least "safe" in a physical sense. "Q" has an interest in him... in fact, "Q"'s entire visit has something to do with our first officer.
 DATA / And the reason for that, sir... ?
 PICARD / I wish I knew. "Q" became interested in him at Farpoint. (shakes head) I've no idea what it means. (to the others) Meanwhile, we must proceed with our rescue mission...
 "Q" (O.S.) / Something amuses you?
 Standing on a ledge above Riker, heavily back-lit by the two suns. (If possible, formed here by two brightly illuminated OUT-OF-FOCUS balls as described earlier.) We'll see more clearly in a moment also that "Q" wears rank and uniform identical to Riker's. / 
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / Perhaps you would share the joke with me?
 RIKER / The joke is you, you silly son of a bitch.
 "Q" glares at Riker who now seems confident and at ease / about something.
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / Strange gratitude from one who has been granted a gift beyond any human dream. How can you not appreciate being able to send your friends back to their ship... (the sweeping gesture) ... or sending the soldiers back to the "nothingness" from which they came?
 "Q" takes a beat, sits on a piece of rock next to / Riker, leans toward him confidentially.
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / (continuing) Certainly, you understand that at this moment you can send yourself back to your ship... or to Earth, or change your shape and become anything else you want to be...
 RIKER / (interrupting; strongly) What do you need, "Q"?
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / "Need?"
 RIKER / You want something from us, "Q". Desperately! What is it?
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / Want something from you foolish, fragile, non-entities? Careful, Riker, you're beginning to sound like your captain.
 RIKER / (grins) Now that's a compliment, "Q". But it's not an answer.
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / (clipped; angry) Riker... we have tried to offer you a gift beyond all other gifts... !
 RIKER / ... Out of the "goodness" of your heart?
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / After Farpoint, I returned to where we exist... the "Q Continuum."
 RIKER / Which means exactly what?
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / (trace of annoyance) The limitless dimensions of the galaxy in which we exist. We could hardly be capable of acting in ways that seem so astonishing to you... if we were limited to the primitive dimensions in which you live, dimensions which would make us prisoners of time and space.
 RIKER / (beat; absorbing this) What do you mean by we?
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / (more annoyance) In our Continuum the terms we and I mean much the same.
 RIKER / I don't understand...
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / Of course you don't, and you never will until you become one of us.
 RIKER / (reacting) Until?... Would you mind going over that again?
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / (nods) If you'll stop interrupting me. This really isn't the time to teach you the true nature of the universe. (MORE)
 "Q" (Cont'd) / (leans in again) At Farpoint, we saw you as savages only, and thought to frighten you into scurrying back to your system. We discovered instead, that you are an unusual creature in your own limited ways... ways which in time may not be so limited.
 RIKER / (nods) We're growing. Something about us compels us to learn, explore...
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / (nods) The human compulsion. And, unfortunately, for us, a force that will grow stronger century after century, eon after eon...
 RIKER / Eons! Have you any idea how far we'll advance?
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / Perhaps in a future you cannot yet conceive... even beyond us. And so, we must know more about the human condition. We have selected you, Riker, to become part of the "Q"... to bring that human need and hunger to us so that we may understand it.
 RIKER / (ponders, then) I... suppose you mean that as a compliment, "Q"... or maybe it's my limited mind... (stands) ... but... to become part of you?! I don't even like you!
 "Q" looks at Riker, seeming amused. / 
 "Q" (COMMANDER) / You're going to miss me!
 "Q" makes the sweeping gesture and it produces the / familiar BLINDING LIGHT FLASH in which "Q" DISAPPEARS. And almost immediately, the startled VOICES of the bridge crew, with Riker whirling in that direction:
 TROI / Oh, no!
 GEORDI / Come on, not again!
 where the entire bridge crew, including Picard and WESLEY, find themselves facing a line of the French / uniformed "animal soldiers," who menace the Enterprise people, ATTACHING LONG AND DEADLY-LOOKING BAYONETS ONTO THEIR MUSKETS, clearly intending to use them. / 
 WESLEY / (totally confused) What's happening, Commander Riker? I was sitting in school...
 TASHA / (interrupting) My phaser's gone. Worf, are you armed?
 PICARD / Where is "Q"? If you have any answer to this, Number One...
 WESLEY / Worf!
 RIKER / NO! DAMN IT, DAMN IT TO HELL... !
 PICARD / Riker, you... you did that?!
 RIKER / And that's not all!!
 PICARD / That grid, their wounds... only the "Q" could do that...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41591.4. Twelve minutes out from Quadra Sigma III where the survivors of an underground disaster desperately need our help. Aboard the Enterprise...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... First Officer William T. Riker needs help nearly as badly. But this is a subject so far out of my experience... out of any human's experience.
 PICARD / Will, how the hell do I advise you what to do?!
 RIKER / No one has ever offered to turn you into "God?"
 PICARD / (snaps) Don't joke with me! What the "Q" has offered you has got to / be close to "immortality," Will. They're not lying about controlling space and time; we've seen it in what they can do. But...
 RIKER / You've also seen it in what I can do.
 PICARD / Of all things, that troubles me most, Will. Are you strong enough to refuse to use that power?
 RIKER / Certainly!
 PICARD / No matter how tempted? No matter how difficult "Q" makes it?
 RIKER / (beat; then firmly) You have my word.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / In orbit of Quadra Sigma III, sir. Ready to beam down rescue team to underground emergency area.
 DATA / This way.
 BEVERLY / You are going to be all right, now.
 RIKER / Where are the others?
 WOMAN / Gone. It's just us.
 GEORDI / (urgent) Commander!
 GEORDI / There's someone there!
 BEVERLY / She's dead. If we'd only gotten here a little sooner... !
 DATA / Sir, if you indeed have "Q"'s power...
 BEVERLY / I don't understand. Can you bring her back to life?
 RIKER / (long beat) No!
 RIKER / As soon as it's convenient Captain, I insist on a meeting with you and your staff.
 PICARD / As soon as we are secure from the rescue operation, we'll meet in the Conference Room.
 RIKER / Thank you.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / Power -- immense. Frightening. I can't read the intent -- but there is terrible anger in him.
 PICARD / We'll confer on the bridge here if no one...
 RIKER / The bridge is fine since I've called the entire staff...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Correction, Number One; knowing the decision you face, I've permitted you this gathering.
 RIKER / Of course, Jean-Luc.
 RIKER / (continuing) This meeting isn't for you, Wesley!
 WESLEY / Why not, sir? You helped make me a bridge officer... (corrects self) ... an acting ensign.
 RIKER / All right, he stays. The first thing he'll hear is... because I've been given unusual powers, I'm not suddenly a monster. Except for those abilities, and I don't yet know how far they go... I'm the same William T. Riker you've always known.
 RIKER / (continuing) Well? Everyone still looks uncomfortable.
 PICARD / Perhaps we're all remembering the old saying... "power corrupts... "
 RIKER / ... "and absolute power corrupts absolutely." Do you believe I haven't thought of that, Jean-Luc?
 PICARD / And have you noticed that you and I are now on a first-name basis?
 PICARD / (continuing) Will, something has happened to you already...
 RIKER / In what way? Haven't you seen how much I've regretted not saving that child? Captain, using the "Q" power to save her might not / have been wrong! (to bridge crew) No more than it was wrong to save the rest of you from those soldier things.
 PICARD / Let's keep in mind that particular danger was invented by "Q".
 TROI / What we represent to the "Q", Will, are lowly animals, tormented into performing for their amusement...
 RIKER / Actually, they think highly of us, Troi. We have a quality of... of growth which they admire...
 GEORDI / Or fear?
 PICARD / Number One, we've learned that the "Q" power does not admire us... "Q" has muddled your mind somehow.
 RIKER / It's your mind that troubles me, Captain. Don't you understand his incredible gift to me?
 "Q" (BROTHER) (O.S.) / Are these truly your "friends," Brother?
 "Q" (BROTHER) / Let us pray for understanding, for compassion, for...
 PICARD / (moving to "Q") Let us do no such damned thing! (pulls at "Q"'s robes) What is this need of yours for costumes? Have you no identity of your own?
 "Q" (BROTHER) / (softly; gently) I come in search of truth.
 PICARD / You come in search of what humanity is!
 "Q" has withdrawn a large cross symbol from his robes / as if warding off Picard's words.
 "Q" (BROTHER) / I forgive your blasphemy...
 PICARD / (indicates "Q" to Riker) Can't you see it, Number One? He's nothing but a flim-flam man! That's what he's been since his first appearance at Farpoint!
 WORF / (to Data) Flim-flam?
 "Q" (BROTHER) / (to Picard) You offer Riker jealousy! What I offer him is clearly beyond your comprehension! (turning to the others one by one) How can you claim friendship for Riker while obstructing his way to the greatest adventure ever offered a human?!
 PICARD / (alerted) "Obstruct him?" Then it's not yet certain? He's not yet committed?
 "Q" (BROTHER) / (quickly, loudly; overlapping last line) The truly evil part of this is your jealousy, Captain. (to Riker) You love each one of your people! Demonstrate it! You have the power to leave each of them with a gift proving your affection.
 RIKER / There'd be no... harm, would there, if I, if I gave them something I know they'd like?
 "Q" (BROTHER) / How touching. A plea to his former captain. (watching Picard) "May I please give some happiness to my friends, sir? Please sir?"
 PICARD / (beat) In fact... I authorize and support that idea, Riker. (to the crew) And please cooperate with him, if you wish.
 TROI / (troubled; cautioning) Are you certain, sir? If...
 PICARD / I'm quite certain, Counselor. (to Riker) By all means, demonstrate your gifts of affection.
 "Q" (BROTHER) / (eyeing Picard) Remarkable! He rises now above jealousy.
 RIKER / Don't be frightened. There is no way I could harm any one of you. Shall I guess your dreams?
 BEVERLY / (quickly) Leave now, Wesley!
 RIKER / No! Wesley, I may know best of all. (smiles at Wesley) Our friendship, our long talks...
 BEVERLY / No, please... !
 RIKER / (to Wesley) Have your favorite wish, my young friend!
 GEORDI / Hey Wes, you've grown into a very good looking guy!
 RIKER / Data...
 DATA / (forcefully shaking head) No!
 RIKER / It's what you've always wanted, Data to become human!
 DATA / Yes, sir, that is true. But I never wanted to compound one illusion with another. It might seem real to "Q" -- even you, sir... but it would not be so to me. Was it not one of the Captain's favorite authors who wrote, "This above all, to thine own self be true?" (beat) Sorry, Commander, I must decline.
 RIKER / Well, my friend, I know what you want. Welcome to the wonderful world of vision.
 GEORDI / You're as beautiful as I imagined, and more.
 RIKER / Then we can throw the VISOR away?
 GEORDI / I think not, sir. The price is a little high for me. I don't like who I would have to thank. I can still steer the ship with this.
 BEVERLY / If you accept this new you, Wesley, you'll lose wonderful times, so many important experiences...
 RIKER / And Worf, who wants nothing...
 WORF / Except honor and my duty fulfilled.
 RIKER / (interrupting) Proud warrior Worf, without a single tie to his own kind...
 WORF / (whirling to Riker) No! She is from a world now alien to me. I have no place in my life for this now!
 WESLEY / Mister Riker... (shakes head) ... it's too soon for this...
 RIKER / If it's because your mother objects...
 WESLEY / No, I'd just like to get there on my own. Honest!
 RIKER / How did you know, sir? I feel like such... such an idiot!
 PICARD / Quite right, you should!
 RIKER / But it was... such a pleasure to have been able to do those things.
 PICARD / It's all over "Q". You have no further business here.
 "Q" (BROTHER) / Human, you have just destroyed yourself... !
 PICARD / But only after you've paid off your wager, "Q".
 "Q" (BROTHER) / I recall no wager!
 PICARD / I'm sure your fellow "Q" remember you agreed to never trouble our species again. Just as they're aware you've failed to tempt a human to join you. So, "Q", I strongly suspect you have some explaining of your own to do...
 PICARD / Extraordinary! "Q" sought to discover the distinguishing characteristic of humanity and never learned what Coleridge said: "It must be the possession of a soul within us that makes the difference."
 GEORDI / Sir... we show the same "hole" in time again. Our instruments say we've just now beamed up from our rescue mission.
 DATA / How can the "Q" handle time and space so well, and us so badly?
 PICARD / Perhaps we'll discover some day that time and space are simpler than the human equation. (toward Riker) No coordinates laid in, Number One?
 RIKER / Uh... yes, sir. (toward Helm) You have my coordinates, Mister La Forge.
 WESLEY / Zero-zero-eight, Mark, three-three-nine, sir.
 PICARD / (nods) Engage!
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41309.5. We are in orbit around Persephone V where I have been sent to confer with Admiral Mark Jameson in regard to an extraordinary situation....
 PICARD / Starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago, Admiral.
 JAMESON / Let's see it, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen and relay to the admiral, Mister Data.
 KARNAS / I am Karnas, governor of Mordan IV. A dissident terrorist group has taken Federation Ambassador Hawkins and his staff hostage. They will not discuss terms with me. This is a crisis I cannot resolve without assistance. The terrorists are demanding a Federation negotiator.
 KARNAS / I feel there is only one negotiator with the skills and understanding to resolve this situation. The hostages' lives will depend on Starfleet delivering this man to Mordan. Commander Mark Jameson. (corrects himself) Admiral Jameson. The terrorists have given you six Earth days to arrive here -- or the hostages will die. Please...hurry.
 PICARD / Starfleet doesn't understand how or why this situation developed. Mordan IV has finally gained peace after decades of civil war --
 JAMESON / Forty years of civil war, Captain.
 PICARD / Yes, sir. Karnas was largely responsible for the planet's unification and peace. Why should he suddenly be unable to deal with rebellious factions?
 JAMESON / Forty-five years ago I negotiated a hostage situation on Mordan. Karnas was a young man then.... (light chuckle) ... but so was I. He seems to feel I can handle the situation again. Obviously Starfleet feels that way too, or you wouldn't be here.
 PICARD / (nods) I'm detailed to take you to Mordan IV as soon as you can be ready, Admiral.
 JAMESON / My wife and I will beam aboard at 1500 hours, Captain. Be prepared to depart this starbase and proceed immediately to Mordan IV. Acknowledge.
 PICARD / Received and acknowledged, sir. Picard out.
 TROI / Nearly 1500 now, sir.
 PICARD / (rising) Well, Number One. Why don't we go and welcome the admiral aboard?
 12   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER CHIEF, PICARD AND RIKER / 
 RIKER / Admiral Jameson, sir. Have you met him before?
 PICARD / Your hero, Number One?
 RIKER / Not only mine. My father served on the Falcon with him. I grew up on stories about Mark Jameson.
 PICARD / (nods) I've heard all the legends about him, too. Not only the Falcon's missions and the Mordan rescue, but the Gettysburg's explorations, his command of the old Pegasus in the Klingon conflicts....
 PICARD / Welcome aboard, Admiral. (indicating Riker) My executive officer, Commander William Riker.
 RIKER / My pleasure, sir. (a nod to Anne) Ma'am.
 JAMESON / My wife, Anne.
 JAMESON / Captain, there are certain details of this mission that you should understand before we begin.
 PICARD / Is this the place to be discussing them, sir?
 JAMESON / Why not? You and your first officer are both here.
 PICARD / Yes, sir.
 JAMESON / Captain, I am not simply an advisor. On any assignment I accompany, Starfleet has designated me Senior Mission Officer. I control the Away Team and all its actions. Is that understood?
 JAMESON / Of course, Captain, you will command the ship -- but the mission is mine. I trust you are in complete agreement.
 PICARD / Yes, sir. Of course.
 GEORDI / Response to our message coming in from Mordan, sir.
 PICARD / Put it on the screen, Mister Data.
 KARNAS (V.O.) / (filtered) Mordan IV to Enterprise. This is Karnas. I will speak to the captain.
 PICARD / I am Captain Picard, in command of the Enterprise.
 KARNAS / (abrupt, curt) Is Admiral Jameson on board?
 PICARD / (nods toward Jameson) He is here, beside my first officer. Do you wish to speak to him now?
 KARNAS / So, Jameson. (squints again) I see time has not been kind.
 JAMESON / It seldom is, Karnas. However, we could save a good deal of it now if you'll outline the terrorists' demands....
 KARNAS / They insist all discussions will take place here... on Mordan. They refuse to speak to me -- only to you.
 JAMESON (V.O.) / They could relay their terms on your communications channels....
 KARNAS / (shakes head) They insist on speaking face to face when you arrive. They say they will brook no excuses. If there are any offered, your ambassador and his people will die. Unpleasantly. I believe them -- and so should you, Admiral.
 JAMESON / (pause, then:) Tell them I accept the conditions of negotiation.
 KARNAS / I will do so immediately. Karnas out.
 24   ANGLE TOWARD COMMAND AREA - EMPHASIZING PICARD AND JAMESON / 
 RIKER / For a man in his position, Karnas doesn't seem to know much about the situation.
 JAMESON / Wrong, Number One. He told me the terrorists are desperate enough to kill if they're crossed. They're willing to talk one on one, but not to him.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Counselor?
 TROI / From his body language as well as his words and tone... I'd judge that what Karnas said was honest, but I sensed a holding back.
 PICARD / Perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than he is willing to admit.
 JAMESON / Possible, but I suspect it's closer to the mark if we said he doesn't want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate. He is a proud man.
 TROI / That could be, sir. Karnas has established himself as a powerful man on Mordan. Suddenly -- in this situation -- his power is useless.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Sickbay to bridge. I am ready for Admiral Jameson now.
 PICARD / He is on his way, Doctor.
 JAMESON / On my way to what, Captain?
 PICARD / Just a routine medical checkup. Ship's regulations.
 BEVERLY / Pardon me, sir, but refusing a simple medical check --
 JAMESON / I'm sorry, Doctor, but it isn't necessary. (hands her a tiny disk) The chief medical officer on Starbase 45 ran a complete battery of tests on me two days ago. Semi-annual exam. You'll find I've been a victim of Iverson's Disease for five years. My "case," as you doctors like to call it, is now chronic. In another year, it will undoubtedly progress to terminal.
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry --
 JAMESON / No need. I do not accept the prognosis, Doctor. But right now, I don't have time to waste, and there's no point in you wasting your time either. (indicates disk) There's your information.
 BEVERLY / Thank you, Admiral. I'll look them over.
 RIKER / What I don't understand, sir, is how Karnas knew you were still... available.
 JAMESON / Still alive, you mean.
 RIKER / (unembarrassed) So far as Karnas knew, you might have been dead, sir.
 JAMESON / Quite right, Commander. But I'm not, and I imagine Ambassador Hawkins told him that. I briefed the ambassador about Mordan before he left to take up residence.
 PICARD / All right. Karnas has a problem he feels you can handle. What can the terrorists want that Karnas can't or won't give them?
 DATA / Mordan has had peace for five years. They have finally come to a state of productivity that satisfies their planetary needs, but no more than that. Perhaps the dissidents feel the Federation can provide more -- technology, science, agricultural assistance....
 JAMESON / I've negotiated many a treaty on many planets, Picard. I've found that peace -- or the appearance of it -- is often a prelude to war.
 TROI / Admiral are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons?
 JAMESON / They may. I am suggesting Karnas is the last man to give them such weapons.
 PICARD / Karnas worked and fought for years to achieve peace.
 JAMESON / And he's not likely to throw it away... even for the lives of the hostages.
 TROI / I see. You believe Karnas won't negotiate on that point, so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator.
 JAMESON / I know Karnas. He is a warrior... he lives for challenge. These people have insulted his honor by taking the embassy staff hostage. I'll negotiate -- but I'll have to be very careful in handling Karnas. He'll want revenge for that insult.
 ANNE / (mildly teasing) ... You're late. Couldn't get away from the bridge?
 JAMESON / Didn't want to. It feels good to be on one again.
 ANNE / (going to him) I'm glad, Mark. (touches chair) Do you want me to help you up?
 ANNE / You're stronger today...
 JAMESON / I'm fine. Feel like a kid again.
 ANNE / This ship is magnificent. Pity we didn't have them twenty, thirty years ago. We could have been together almost all of your career.
 ANNE (V.O.) / It's so good to be able to be with you now.
 ANNE / Mark! I'll call Sickbay --
 JAMESON / No! There's no need. It's happened before --
 ANNE / When? You haven't said anything --
 JAMESON / It'll pass... give me a moment....
 JAMESON / (continuing) See... I'm better. It's going away.
 ANNE / What is it? Do the doctors know?
 JAMESON / Just body changes... My last checkup, they said I'd have to expect it.
 ANNE / You're sure? Don't lie to me.
 JAMESON / I'm sure.
 33   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND PICARD / 
 BEVERLY / ... All the medical information the admiral provided is satisfactory, sir....
 PICARD / (it's routine) Excellent, Doctor --
 BEVERLY / (overriding) Except for one thing.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) The test results he gave me aren't two days old, they're two months old. The medical file coder always includes the date as part of the file number. He lied to me, sir -- and I don't know why.
 PICARD / He is eighty years old, Doctor. For some, the memory begins to fail....
 BEVERLY / He suffers from Iverson's Disease, sir. It affects the body -- not the mind. I just have a gut feeling he's hiding something.
 PICARD / I'd expect that observation from Counselor Troi, but -- (on her sharp look) I respect your opinion, Doctor. And I'll want you on the bridge for the next day or so. The admiral has to remain in the best of health for these negotiations. He might require your services.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's personal log... I am puzzled and somewhat concerned by the dating error Admiral Jameson made on his medical records.
 PICARD / (rises, turns to Jameson) Admiral, we're approaching the Idini Star Cluster. Would you like to take the Conn as we make transit?
 JAMESON / Thank you, Captain. I would.
 PICARD / Well, Admiral. Quite a little surprise you've pulled on us.
 BEVERLY / Yes. Quite.
 JAMESON / Neglected to mention... I began some new therapy before I left. Seems to be working. I haven't felt this good since the last time I was in space. The Gettysburg. All I needed to get me out of that chair was the thought of walking the decks in command of a starship again.
 PICARD / Admiral... you only have the Conn temporarily.
 JAMESON / (laughs lightly) Figure of speech. Of course she's your ship. (takes the chair) I'll just keep an eye on her for a while.
 PICARD / The admiral displayed a remarkable improvement out there, wouldn't you say?
 BEVERLY / Captain, no one recovers from Iverson's Disease. There is no known cure, and there are no cases where it has gone into remission. I haven't heard of any new therapy that would have results like this.
 PICARD / Then how do you account for it?
 BEVERLY / I can't. All I can tell you is that the admiral has been confined to the support chair for four years by the effects of Iverson's. By all the medical facts we know, he should never have walked again.
 PICARD / I'd like you to look into it, Doctor. Thoroughly.
 BEVERLY / Yes, sir.
 KARNAS / The terrorists have given you six Earth days to bring him here -- or the hostages will die. Please...hurry.
 ANNE / I don't know how much more information you think you can get out of that tape.
 ANNE / Mark... ? My God... what happened?
 JAMESON / It's a new therapy I've been taking. It's -- working, Anne.
 ANNE / (runs to him) Oh, Mark!
 ANNE / Mark... ?
 JAMESON / I told you I just needed to get back into space again.
 ANNE / (studies him) You're really looking much better....
 JAMESON / It's the new treatment.
 ANNE / No... come here....
 JAMESON / (makes another grab for her) I hope you're heading for the bedroom.
 ANNE / Stop it, Mark.
 ANNE / Mark, you look like you did twenty years ago.
 JAMESON / (laughs) You're flattering me.
 ANNE / Mark, what the hell is going on?
 JAMESON / I don't know what --
 ANNE / Mark!
 ANNE / (continuing) Sickbay! Medical emergency in the admiral's quarters!
 BEVERLY / (frowning) I've found traces of chemical substances in his blood and tissue samples, but none of them are in our pharmacopeia. We're still working on alien references to substances like these. All I can say is that he ingested something that's strongly affecting his body.
 PICARD / Specifics, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Captain, there are so many things going on here, I can't be positive without a lot more tests.
 PICARD / Give me what you have now.
 BEVERLY / His red cell count is running riot. Then there's the cellular structure of his body tissue. It's -- changing. I can't even begin on that until I see what it's changing to. His DNA is all skewed. I don't know how it's possible, but he even looks younger. And Captain... there is absolutely no sign of Iverson's Disease.
 PICARD / You said there is no cure for Iverson's.
 BEVERLY / (shakes head) None we know of. Whatever else these substances are doing to his body, at least they've done that for him. But how or why, I can't say on the information I have now.
 PICARD / Get me some answers, Doctor. As soon as possible.
 BEVERLY / Yes, sir.
 ANNE / Captain....
 PICARD / There are some questions I have to ask the admiral, Mrs. Jameson.
 JAMESON (O.S.) / Ask away. There's nothing to hide now.
 PICARD / (recovers himself) Admiral -- in addition to your rank, you are a particularly valuable commodity just now. Starfleet has a right to some answers.
 JAMESON / I'd been planning this for a long time -- ever since I learned I had Iverson's Disease. Since it put me in that chair.
 ANNE / What did you do, Mark?
 JAMESON / There's a planet in the Cerberus system -- Cerberus II -- they say the natives have a process that rejuvenates the body... gives you your youth back.
 PICARD / I've heard that story, too. It's a myth.
 JAMESON / It's true, Picard. I'm the living proof. Oh, it's dangerous -- the mortality rate is high -- and it's painful. (ruefully) Very painful. Aliens are seldom allowed to obtain the process, but I managed it. I negotiated a treaty for Cerberus II several years ago, and they felt obligated to honor my request for the process.
 PICARD / (studies him) Obviously it works rapidly. How does it work?
 JAMESON / The herb and drug combinations are self-administered... slowly, over a period of two years. Every response is different, depending on a being's DNA. (to Anne) I got enough for both of us, Anne -- but I had to test it on myself first. I couldn't risk you. If I died... well, I was half a man anyway, to what did it matter... ?
 ANNE / It would matter to me.
 JAMESON / But I was starting to change, Anne. It was almost undetectable, but the improvement was there. Then this hostage situation came up, and I knew I'd have to be at my peak to deal with it. I didn't have time to wait for the drugs to work naturally --
 PICARD / You took the whole dose.
 JAMESON / I took both of them. And look at me! Annie, look at me. I'm strong, alert, I'm fit. I'm fitter than you are, Picard. And I'm getting younger!
 PICARD / The only question I have, Admiral, is why you felt it necessary to be young to negotiate the hostage release. Surely Karnas requested you because of your age and experience.
 PICARD / I'll be on the bridge, Admiral, if you wish to talk further.
 ANNE / Why didn't you tell me, Mark? We've always been honest with each other -- until now.
 JAMESON / Annie, I did it for us.
 ANNE / I'm sure you believed that -- until you had a chance to head up a mission... to command again. Then you just upended the bottle -- or whatever it was -- and damn all. Did you think about me at all?
 JAMESON / I got enough of the dosage for both of us....
 ANNE / But you never asked if I wanted it. It's just like you, Mark, to assume that what you felt was right was the only answer.
 JAMESON / It was the right answer for me. It was killing you, having to take care of an invalid. What good was I to you? Annie -- we can be together again....
 ANNE / Let me go!
 JAMESON / I can get another supply of the drug for you --
 JAMESON / Commander Data, I wish to open a communication frequency to Karnas.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / A moment, Mister Data. Admiral, this is Picard. May I know the purpose of this communication?
 JAMESON / Karnas must have tried to negotiate with the terrorists before he was forced to call on me. I want all the information he has access to.
 PICARD / You said he was a proud man... probably sensitive about his failure to deal with the situation. Is it wise to press him on this?
 JAMESON / I'm the negotiator, Picard. Karnas will have to cooperate with me and the terrorists, and damn his sensitivities.
 PICARD / Then I suggest a secured channel, Admiral.
 JAMESON / (beat, then:) A sensible precaution, Picard. Make it so.
 DATA / Aye, sir. Frequency open and secured.
 JAMESON / (to Viewer) Karnas.
 KARNAS / What is it you want, Admiral?
 JAMESON / We're on a secured channel, Karnas. You can talk freely. Who's behind this thing? You said dissidents.
 KARNAS / (carefully) Yes... political opponents who feel the Federation will disavow me as governor if they stir up enough trouble on Mordan.
 JAMESON / Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor?
 KARNAS / They're dead, Jameson. A long time now. For a long time I thought you were dead, too.
 JAMESON / I almost died a couple of times on missions, but I always made it through somehow.
 KARNAS / (coldly) Yes. Now you're coming back to Mordan -- to negotiate for hostages again. It's almost as though the forty-five years between never happened....
 JAMESON / You've never forgiven me.
 KARNAS / Should I have -- after the legacy of war you left us in your last "negotiation?"
 JAMESON / There are no dissidents, are there? No terrorists. You have the hostages.
 KARNAS / And if I have? You're coming to Mordan, Jameson. You're going to negotiate for their lives, and I'm going to ask a very high price for them.
 JAMESON / What if I refuse?
 KARNAS / Then the hostages will die. You've seen how my executioners work. They are still as efficient as they were... perhaps even more skilled now. You'll come -- even if you don't have much honor left. Karnas out.
 JAMESON / Are we still on schedule to arrive at Mordan in thirty-eight hours?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. We're at warp four now.
 JAMESON / Picard, I want a jump to warp eight so we arrive ahead of our announced ETA. It'll throw Karnas off balance, and we can catch him before he's ready.
 PICARD / Ready for exactly what, Admiral?
 JAMESON / I believe Karnas is planning something new... something that will directly endanger the hostages' lives.
 PICARD / What happened in your communication to bring you to that conclusion? It seems a big jump....
 JAMESON / I'm not at liberty to say, Picard, but negotiation is not the answer or the issue here. The hostages' lives are at stake.
 PICARD / I agree the most important thing is saving the lives of the hostages...
 JAMESON / And you agree with that, too, Riker?
 RIKER / I do, sir.
 JAMESON / Good. Because I plan to personally lead an away team on an armed rescue mission to get them out of there.
 JAMESON / Commander Data, will you bring up the plans I requested on the Viewscreen, please.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 JAMESON / Most of Mordan's principal city was devastated in the war. What was left consisted of a network of underground tunnels -- a rat's maze. When they rebuilt the city, they simply built over the tunnels.
 DATA / I have it, sir.
 RIKER / Admiral, even if you're right about Karnas being behind this, he still wants to negotiate. Or at least to talk. Why not hear what he has to say?
 JAMESON / I've heard what he has to say, and I have good reason to believe he's lying.
 GEORDI / Pardon me, sir, but where do these come into the picture?
 JAMESON / This is where Karnas held his hostages before and where I believe he has them now.
 PICARD / Wouldn't that be a little too obvious, Admiral?
 JAMESON / Karnas is a dogged strategist, Picard -- not a brilliant one. He sticks to what works.
 PICARD / An overt rescue attempt could push Karnas into killing the hostages outright.
 JAMESON / I don't think that's what he wants, Picard.
 PICARD / Then what does he want?
 TASHA / Maybe his threats are just a way to bargain for what he wants....
 JAMESON / Karnas means exactly what he says, Lieutenant. He will kill the hostages if we don't get them out of there.
 PICARD / Therefore you see an armed raid as our only option.
 JAMESON / You don't agree.
 PICARD / I would point out no one else has heard or considered Karnas's demands but you, Admiral. The Federation might take a different view of them if they knew what they were.
 JAMESON / Starfleet gave me command of the away team, Picard. I intend to use them as I see fit.
 PICARD / Is Jameson physically able to lead an away mission, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / His cells, his tissue, even his bones are still de-aging, but I'd say he was. Generally, I'd call Admiral Jameson a healthy man... about forty-five... in excellent physical condition.
 PICARD / What about his mind?
 BEVERLY / The same. Brain scan reveals all cells and tissue are changing, but healthy. No loss of memory... exellent grasp of facts.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / Certainly his physical capacities have been restored. I sense that gives him great satisfaction. When he came aboard, he seemed hopeful, eager. Now there seems to be a harder, more forceful attitude... ambition....
 PICARD / More of a young man's attitude, I'd say. Aggressive... going right for the throat of a situation instead of considering the alternatives.
 TROI / Part of that is ambition too. He wants to be the man he once was. He is the man he once was, but sometimes old memories aren't very accurate. He was able to lead away teams like this once. Now he believes he can do it again.
 ANNE / Our anniversary is next week. Fifty years....
 BEVERLY / In his heart, he's still the same man you married, Anne.
 TROI / That's true. He still cares for you, despite the physical changes he's undergoing.
 ANNE / (confused, anguished) But he's getting younger, and I'm -- well, look at me. Why did he do this... ?
 TROI / There are lives at stake, Mrs. Jameson.
 ANNE / What about our lives? Mine and his, together?
 BEVERLY / (takes Anne's hand) Anne... I think I know a little of what you're feeling. My husband died on an away mission. We'd been married two years. So little time. Look at what you've had with Mark --
 ANNE / Years, yes -- but not together. I was looking forward to time together finally -- our retirement. Now he's young again and has a life to live over.
 TROI / She has to know, Doctor.
 ANNE / Know what?
 BEVERLY / Anne... he's --
 ANNE / What is it?
 BEVERLY / He's not stabilizing. (pause) He may not have that life to live over.
 JAMESON (O.S.) / We'll be at Mordan in three hours.
 PICARD / I couldn't sleep either.
 JAMESON / I never could before a mission. Always wound up in the Observation Lounge, staring out at the stars. Thinking.
 PICARD / Maybe in this case rethinking?
 JAMESON / Perceptive. They always have given you high marks for that at Starfleet, Picard.
 PICARD / (shrugs it away, then:) Why is this mission so important to you? Why did you risk your life so you could lead it personally?
 JAMESON / I want to save lives, Picard.
 PICARD / Noble sentiment -- but too easy an answer. You've been here before. You negotiated a release of hostages with Karnas before. Why is it now your answer is an armed raid?
 PICARD / (continuing) It's my away team you're going to send in. There's something you're not telling me, and I have a right to know what it is.
 JAMESON / (grunts) Do you know the background? The Mordanites had some sophistication, but were still ruled by tribal family units. Karnas's father was the ruling chief of one of the families, and another tribe had him assassinated. Karnas seized the passengers of a starliner and held them hostage, demanding that Starfleet provide him with weapons that would enable him to defeat his rivals.
 PICARD / That's the official record.
 JAMESON / (nods) Officially the story is that after two other mediators were murdered, I went in and negotiated with Karnas to bring out the hostages safely.
 PICARD / Are you saying that's not the truth?
 JAMESON / It wasn't my golden oratory that saved them, Picard. I gave Karnas the weapons he wanted.
 PICARD / You did what?
 JAMESON / I gave exactly the same weapons to his rivals. My interpretation of the Prime Directive. Let them solve their problems with those arms on an equal basis.
 PICARD / That decision plunged them into forty years of civil war.
 JAMESON / I didn't know that would happen. I thought, a minor war -- it'll be settled in less than a year. How could I know it would be four decades? I falsified the reports to Starfleet, but I've lived with that on my soul, Picard. Sixty-three people came away safe -- but millions died on Mordan because I delivered those weapons.
 PICARD / Karnas could have worked for peace all those years instead of continuing the war. It's not all on your head, Admiral.
 JAMESON / But I started it. I lit the match. Now, finally, I can vindicate myself, if only in a small way. I came to negotiate, but that isn't what Karnas wants.
 PICARD / Revenge. That's why he demanded you when he found out you were still alive.
 JAMESON / I'm not going to give it to him, Picard. I'm going to do what I should have done the first time. We're taking the hostages out by force. No deals.
 JAMESON / Prepare to energize, Chief.
 PICARD / Belay that.
 PICARD / (continuing) Admiral, the correct place for you is on the bridge...
 JAMESON / I will remind you one more time, Picard, I am the Senior Mission Commander, and I'm leading this team.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I'm the captain of this ship, and I have it, too. You have command of the Enterprise, Commander Riker. (to the Chief) Energize.
 JAMESON / Yes...perfect. We are in the M-4 tunnel directly under the governor's residence. M-4 is a subsidiary tunnel, but it crosses and links with several main ones.
 DATA / I am sorry, sir. That does not correspond with the information I have on the tricorder, sir.
 JAMESON / Your information is incorrect, Commander. I know these tunnels like the back of my own hand. (gestures off) That way. It takes us to the hatch that will let us into M-1 tunnel. Keep scanning for signs of human life forms. Karnas held his hostages in these tunnels before. He'll do it again.
 DATA / The admiral is definitely incorrect, Captain. The tunnel schematics we have indicate this is a dead end. It was sealed off two years ago....
 PICARD / I've no doubt you're right, Mister Data. However, forty-five years ago, I'm sure it linked in with the tunnels Admiral Jameson remembers.
 GEORDI / Steelplast. Fairly recent installation.
 JAMESON / Damn. This is the most direct route. Set phasers to cut through it.
 TASHA / If you have the coordinates for where you think the hostages are, sir, we could just beam in there.
 JAMESON / But Karnas might not have them in the same place. There is no substitute for a personal reconnoiter, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / No, sir.
 GEORDI / Admiral, there's an infrared light signal ahead. Steady beam, straight across the tunnel, chest high. Another at hip level.
 TASHA / An alarm trigger or --
 PICARD / Reset phasers to stun.
 WORF / Look out, sir!
 DATA / Their phasers, sir -- set on kill.
 PICARD / (drily) Thank you, Mister Data. I have heard the sound before.
 TASHA / Is he hit?
 DATA / (trying to examine him) I cannot tell --
 PICARD / (tabs communicator) Enterprise, this is Picard. Five to beam up -- now!
 PICARD / How badly is he hurt?
 DATA / I do not see any sign of a wound, sir.
 DATA / It appears to be another attack, sir.
 PICARD / (to Tasha) Call Doctor Crusher here immediately.
 TASHA / Sir. (goes to transporter console) Transporter Room Three to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher, please report immediately with Medical Support Team.
 BEVERLY / This last attack is the worst one he's suffered, sir. The others were overwith fairly quickly. He hasn't recovered from this one yet, and nothing has been able to relieve his pain.
 PICARD / Do you have any answers, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid none of it is very hopeful. The compound he took seems to be rejuvenating the DNA, but it's also sloughing off the old cells too fast for his body to cope. His body is trying to grow and die and regenerate all at the same time.
 PICARD / (sighs) You're saying the overdose of the drug he took is working too well.
 BEVERLY / Exactly, sir.
 PICARD / When will it stop?
 BEVERLY / It won't... because it can't. Eventually, he won't be able to stand the strain.
 RIKER / The admiral... ?
 PICARD / Sickbay. "Not good" is a galactic understatement.
 GEORDI / Karnas again, sir. On the screen.
 KARNAS / Enterprise. There has been an armed intrusion in the tunnels beneath the city. That smells of Jameson. Where is he?
 PICARD / This is Picard. I am sorry to inform you that the admiral is critically ill, Karnas.
 KARNAS / (coming out of the chair) That is not my concern. Sick or well, you have ten minutes to beam him down, Captain Picard. Otherwise, the hostages die.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Sickbay to bridge.
 PICARD / Picard.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Doctor Crusher requests your presence in Sickbay immediately, sir.
 PICARD / On my way.
 PICARD / What is it?
 BEVERLY / You'd better see for yourself.
 JAMESON (BOY) / Picard....
 JAMESON (BOY) / Picard, I have to get to Karnas.
 BEVERLY / I can't allow him out of my care, sir.
 JAMESON (BOY) / My last option, Picard. The raid failed... all I have left to bargain with is myself....
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Picard.
 PICARD / (to companel) Picard here. What is it, Number One?
 RIKER / A new demand from Karnas, sir. If we don't deliver Jameson in five minutes, a hostage will be executed. Fifteen minutes after that, another.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / He promises the method of execution will be both slow and painful.
 JAMESON / Let me go. If I turn myself over to him, he'll let the hostages go. It's me he wants.
 PICARD / It's certain death for you, Admiral.
 JAMESON / My life for how many hostages, Picard? Twenty? (hard) Let me go.
 PICARD / (beat, then:) Number One, inform Karnas we'll be beaming down in less than five minutes.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / "We," sir?
 PICARD / You have your orders, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir. Riker out.
 RIKER / Captain, you can't go down there again -- (stops, staring at the boy) Jameson... ?
 PICARD / Yes. Exactly why I have to go, Will. As a Starfleet captain, I have negotiating powers. (to Transporter Chief) Energize.
 KARNAS / (outraged) Who are you! I want Jameson!
 PICARD / This is Admiral Mark Jameson.
 KARNAS / This charade will accomplish nothing, Picard. Beam Jameson down, and the hostages will be freed. Continue this -- and I promise you they will die -- and you with them.
 JAMESON (BOY) / Karnas, if you'll just listen....
 KARNAS / (to Picard) Why have you brought him here? This is no place for children.
 JAMESON (BOY) / (interrupting) Peretor Karnas. You always were a stubborn man. I thought you wanted me. I'm here. Release the hostages. now.
 KARNAS / "Peretor" was my old title. Why do you call me that?
 JAMESON (BOY) / Because you're acting like the warrior you were -- not like the planetary governor you are.
 KARNAS / Picard, I warn you, this trick is going too far. He has been coached... for some devious reason. If this farce is not stopped immediately, you and the hostages will be put to death.
 PICARD / Admiral!
 KARNAS / I'm waiting for an explanation, Captain.
 PICARD / He is the admiral. Before we left on this mission, he administered an overdose of an alien de-aging drug to himself. He wanted to face you with strength again... on even terms. This is what the drug has done to him.
 KARNAS / This story you are telling is unbelievable. Jameson is a man of eighty, not -- (points to Jameson) -- this. I want that old man, Picard. I want to show him this world he helped to make... the scars on old soldiers' bodies... the graveyards of our young dead... the wasted cities we are still rebuilding... and all of it caused by him.
 PICARD / As I understand the facts, Karnas, you were the one who demanded weapons to avenge your father's death.
 KARNAS / But Jameson didn't give weapons only to us. If he had, we would have triumphed over our enemies in less than a year, and we would have had peace in all these decades. When Jameson gave weapons to both sides, he gave us forty years of war. I want him to pay for that, Picard.
 BEVERLY / Sir, I think Mrs. Jameson should beam down. Now.
 PICARD / (nods quickly) Do it.
 PICARD / Karnas, I've asked Doctor Crusher to bring down the visual records we've made of Admiral Jameson's deterioration. Will you look at them?
 KARNAS / You're wasting my time, Picard.
 PICARD / Only a few moments.
 PICARD / (continuing) You saw Admiral Jameson when he was on board en route to Mordan?
 KARNAS / Yes.
 PICARD / You recognized him?
 KARNAS / (reluctantly) Yes.
 PICARD / And this is the man you saw.
 KARNAS (V.O.) / Yes. This is the man I want.
 PICARD / Never again, Karnas.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Once he took the compound ... there was no way to stop it.
 PICARD / You'll have to deal with me, Karnas. Whatever you wanted from Jameson isn't possible any more.
 PICARD / (continuing) You wanted revenge, Karnas. You blamed your war on Jameson, and there's no doubt he had a lot to do with it. But you had the weapons, and you used them. You could have tried for negotiations for peace on your planet long ago. You chose to fight instead. How many of those forty years of war are on your head?
 KARNAS / Jameson has to pay for his crimes... I have sworn it to my people. When I found out he was alive, I gave them my word I would kill him for what he did. A public execution... public retribution for what he did to us.
 PICARD / (points to the boy) Then there's Jameson. He wanted to atone for what he'd done here. Forty-five years ago, he made the wrong decision, and he wanted to come here to somehow right it. He wanted to negotiate, and when that failed, he decided to fight. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Your men foiled that, and all he has left now is to give himself up to you. He's brought this retribution on himself.
 KARNAS / No. I don't believe you. You are shielding Jameson on the ship and telling me this tale to save his life.
 JAMESON (BOY) / Peretor Karnas... there were only two of us in the meeting. You didn't even trust your lieutenants then. You told me old Peretor Sain had ordered your father's assassination. You told me you wanted arms to destroy him. Peace wasn't on your mind. You just wanted revenge. And I gave you the weapons to do it.
 KARNAS / Jameson told you all this.
 JAMESON (BOY) / I am Jameson. Do you want a list of the weapons I gave you? Only you and I would know what it was, because I erased every trace of them from the records.
 KARNAS / Jameson still could have told you this. (beat) If you are him, show me the scar.
 JAMESON / (rolls up sleeve) There. The blood cut you gave me to seal our bargain.
 KARNAS / It is you. Somehow... it is you.
 KARNAS / (continuing) Then die by one of your own weapons!
 KARNAS / (continuing) No. My revenge is in letting you live like this.
 KARNAS / Such pain....
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher?
 BEVERLY / His body can't rejuvenate any further. The compound he took is trying to force the organs and tissue to go further, younger, and they can't take the stress. It's like he's -- imploding. I can't do anything to stop it, sir.
 PICARD / Can you give him something for the pain?
 ANNE / Mark... can you hear me?
 JAMESON (BOY) / Yes.
 ANNE / I'll always love you.
 JAMESON (BOY) / Annie with the golden hair....
 ANNE / (forces a smile) Flatterer. It's grey now.
 JAMESON (BOY) / I only see the gold....
 KARNAS / Rest, Jameson. Your long night -- and mine -- is over. (up to Picard) The hostages will be released immediately, Captain. I am prepared to be -- cooperative.
 PICARD / ... The hostages have been freed by Karnas, unharmed. (pause) Personal note. The body of Admiral Mark Jameson has been buried on Mordan, at the request of his widow and with the permission of Karnas. Log out.
 PICARD / The quest for youth, Number One... so futile. Age and wisdom have their graces.
 RIKER / I wonder if one doesn't have to have age and wisdom to appreciate that, sir.
 PICARD / I hope not, Number One. It would be such a waste of youth. (beat, then:) Mister La Forge, prepare to take us out of orbit. Set course for Isis III.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. Leaving orbit.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Ship's log, First Officer Riker reporting. Stardate 41997.7 We are about to make a brief but necessary contact with the Jarada, a reclusive race known for its idiosyncratic attitude towards protocol... The Federation has been trying unsuccessfully to establish a relationship, and now the task falls to Captain Picard.
 RIKER sits alone at the Command Area. WESLEY and WORF / man the Ops and Conn; DATA is at Science One.
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... In two days we will reach the area of their planet, known as Torona Four. The Jarada demand a precise greeting. Their language is most unusual...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... The slightest mispronunciation is regarded as an insult.
 PICARD is earnestly studying. WE SEE a text filled / with Jaradan (HA-RAH-DAN) figures and their English equivalents.
 TROI / The double bars indicate an elongated "s" sound --
 PICARD / (nodding) -- And the inverted "T" means to hold the "zee."
 TROI / Unless... ?
 PICARD / Unless it's followed by three wavy lines; in which case the "zee" becomes a "bee."
 TROI / Exactly.
 PICARD / What a language.
 TROI / It is an insect mind.
 PICARD / (burnt out) My mind's barely working.
 TROI / Take a break, sir.
 PICARD / (shaking head) No. I want to go over it again.
 TROI / You could be over-preparing. You've been looking forward to the upgrade of the Holodeck. You have the time. You need the diversion...
 PICARD / Dixon Hill.
 TROI / The program's installed and waiting.
 PICARD / Earth... United States... San Francisco, California.
 PICARD / (pondering it) 1941, A.D.
 PICARD / File Dixon Hill, private detective.
 PICARD / I don't understand --
 PICARD / The uniform. Totally inappropriate. Why didn't I change?
 PICARD / Uh, I lost a bet.
 PICARD / Halloween?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. I am delighted with how the Holodeck has created the fictional world of Dixon Hill...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... the twentieth century detective who has been a hero of mine since childhood.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) The illusion is flawless. The computer characters accept me as Dixon Hill, even to the extent that Jessica Bradley, a millionaire's wife from the wrong side of the tracks, wants to hire me.
 PICARD / Or a lover, perhaps?
 PICARD / Twenty dollars a day. Plus expenses.
 PICARD / I haven't said yes yet.
 PICARD / I'll take your word for it.
 PICARD / (to himself, soft) Remarkable.
 PICARD / (calling out) You'll have to call again. I'm just leaving. I'm not dressed properly. I'll be back.
 LEECH / Not yet, please --
 PICARD / Memory: save current setting.
 PICARD / Holodeck OFF.
 PICARD / When I looked down on the street, I actually saw automobiles!
 DATA / An ancient Earth device used primarily for transportation.
 WORF / Ahh.
 DATA / Also seen as a source of status and virility; often a prime ingredient in teenage mating rituals --
 WESLEY / Teenage mating rituals?
 PICARD / I saw an entire city block from that window.
 BEVERLY / It sounds wonderful.
 PICARD / I'm going to try it again, only this time I'm going to dress the part. (to Beverly) Why not come with me?
 PICARD / I also want to take that historian... the twentieth century expert...
 TASHA / Whalen.
 PICARD / Yes, Whalen. He probably knows more about Dixon Hill than I do.
 DATA / I will tell him.
 PICARD / Invite him, Mister Data. This is, after all, a leisure activity.
 PICARD / The sense of reality is incredible. When that woman kissed me, it was so --
 BEVERLY / Exciting?
 PICARD / Real. (clears throat) The subject of this meeting is the Jaradan rendezvous. Proceed with the briefing, Number One.
 RIKER / This is primarily a necessary diplomatic mission. The Jaradan are strategically important to the Federation. Previous attempts failed because they are so easily irritated. A slip in the pronunciation of the greeting caused a twenty-year rift in the relation.
 DATA / Therefore the captain must recite the entire greeting without any mistakes.
 GEORDI / (amused) Simple as that.
 DATA / (straightforward) Yes. If, on the other hand, the captain makes even the slightest error --
 TASHA / -- The captain is well aware of the gravity of the situation, Commander.
 DATA / I have located a history tape of the last Federation starship to come in contact with the Jarada. It graphically demonstrates what happened when that captain offended them.
 TROI / The captain is familiar with that, Data.
 DATA / Should we not run it?
 PICARD / It's not necessary. Meeting adjourned.
 DATA / Why would the captain not want to review all the information available on the subject?
 GEORDI / When you've seen the Jaradan react once, you don't ever have to see it again.
 DATA / Dixon Hill is a most puzzling character.
 GEORDI / Not really. He was just a twentieth-century Sherlock Holmes.
 DATA / But his modus operandi is quite dissimilar. Worth investigating.
 GEORDI / Indubitably, Watson.
 DATA / Computer: request all biographical information on fictional character Dixon Hill.
 DATA / Request complete text of all stories involving said character.
 DATA / Increase speed.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) The Jaradan rendezvous is eleven hours away...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) I am about to reenter the world of Dixon Hill, this time properly dressed. An experience like this is more enjoyable when shared, so I've invited Lit-historian Whalen to accompany me. Doctor Crusher will join us shortly...
 PICARD / Ready to go to San Francisco, Mister Whalen?
 WHALEN / More than ready, sir.
 PICARD / If it's anything like the last time I'm sure you won't be disappointed --
 DATA / Request permission to accompany you, sir.
 DATA / I have mastered the lingo of the period. Example: (psuedo-Bogart) It was raining in the city of Angels -- a hard rain -- almost hard enough to wash the slime from the streets. But it never does. When the rain stops, the boulevard dries and the snakes once again slink from their holes. That's when my door opens and the helpless, the desperate, walk through with a heart full of hurt and a pocket full of nothing.
 DATA / It unearthed half-forgotten feelings the same way it dug up sleeping bones in shallow unmarked graves. (pause) It was that kind of day.
 WHALEN / (enthusiastic) Dixon Hill: "The Black Orchid," Chapter Three.
 PICARD / Very impressive, gentlemen. Now... Shall we?
 39   EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT - TIGHT ON PICARD, WHALEN AND DATA / 
 VENDOR / Hey Dix!
 VENDOR / (continuing) How's tricks?
 PICARD / Uh, she's fine... just fine.
 WHALEN / (to Picard, softly) Wonderful! He really thinks you're Dixon Hill!
 PICARD / Say Joe, I'd like to buy a paper too, but I don't have any money.
 VENDOR / Catch me next time, Dix.
 PICARD / (reading) "Hitler on the move... Roosevelt presses Congress for British aid... DiMaggio streak reaches thirty-seven?"
 DATA / DiMaggio. Joltin' Joe, the Yankee clipper.
 WHALEN / (to Picard) Baseball. A national obsession at the time.
 DATA / The streak they refer to, will eventually reach fifty-six games...
 DATA / (continuing) And be snapped by a pair of journeyman hurlers for the Cleveland Indians --
 VENDOR / Cleveland!!!
 VENDOR / (continuing; scornful) They got no pitching! They never got no pitching. What are ya, nuts or somethin'?
 DATA / The record will stand until the year 2026, when a shortstop for the London Kings--
 VENDOR / (to Picard, interrupting) Hey Dix, what gives with this guy? (leans forward, studies Data's face) He ain't from around here, is he?
 PICARD / Uh, no... he's not. (pause) He's from South America.
 VENDOR / Yeah. He's got a nice tan.
 PICARD / (somber) I should have listened to her. She told me someone was trying to kill her.
 WHALEN / (softly) She's a page from a book, sir. That's all she ever was.
 DATA / Cat?
 VENDOR / South America. Can't you tell?
 PICARD / That would be a bit hard to explain.
 PICARD / What for?
 RIKER / Status report?
 TASHA / We're being probed, sir.
 RIKER / The Jarada.
 TASHA / Most likely. But it's long range. Can't be certain where it's originating..
 RIKER / (half-smile) One could get the feeling they don't exactly trust us.
 GEORDI / Commander, I'm receiving a subspace message from the Jarada.
 RIKER / That's not part of the plan. (pause) Pipe it through.
 RIKER / This is Commander Riker, first officer of the Enterprise --
 RIKER / No sir, I'm not. I suggest we commence with screen to screen communication so we can see each other --
 RIKER / (sighing) Terrific.
 RIKER / (continuing) Get the captain. You'll find him in the Holodeck.
 DATA / Hiya Doc. What's shakin'? (notes her pale look) Are you alright?
 BEVERLY / I'm just a little dizzy, thank you. I had some trouble coming through. Where's Captain Picard?
 DATA / He's on ice.
 BEVERLY / Pardon?
 DATA / He's being grilled.
 BEVERLY / (a little frustrated) What is he Data, a fish?
 WHALEN / (laughing) The captain's being interrogated. (melodramatic) They think he's committed a murder.
 BEVERLY / (a bit alarmed) Shouldn't we be doing something to help him?
 WHALEN / Relax Doctor. It's all part of the game. Believe me, he's having the time of his life in there.
 PICARD / I've told you everything I know.
 PICARD / Very good. I've read all this before. It's exactly as it should be.
 GEORDI / La Forge to bridge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker here.
 GEORDI / (with difficulty) I can't find the captain, sir.
 RIKER / I told you, he's in the Holodeck.
 GEORDI / Something's... gone wrong.
 RIKER / What are you saying Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / I can't communicate with them. I can't access the program -- and I can't open the doors.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Ship's log, supplemental. First officer reporting. Due to an unknown breakdown in the Holodeck, we are unable to locate the captain and his party...
 RIKER / Tasha, take over. I'm going to Holdeck Three.
 WESLEY / Commander?... I've studied all the technical manuals on the Holodeck. I think I could be of some help down there.
 RIKER / Geordi's well equipped to deal with the situation, Wes. Right now, your duties are on the bridge.
 TROI / (softly) His mother's in there too, sir.
 RIKER / Come on, Wesley.
 WESLEY / Thank you sir.
 PICARD / I've already told you that. Twice.
 PICARD / (rising) Look fellows, this is no longer amusing.
 McNARY / Easy, Mike!
 McNARY / (small smile) Don't take him too seriously, Dix. His old lady's been giving him a hard time. You know how it is.
 PICARD / I need to get out of here.
 McNARY / Yeah. I'll see what I can do.
 BEVERLY / (moving toward him) Something on your mind?
 BEVERLY / Is that good?
 BEVERLY / McCarthy?... Oh, you mean the man who hunted Communist witches.
 DATA (O.S.) / Do you mind if I experiment with this device?
 DATA / Thanks, Mac.
 McNARY / Okay Dix. We're bustin' you out of here.
 PICARD / (rising) That's welcome news.
 PICARD / (wry) It's been a pleasure, sir.
 PICARD / (dryly) I get the feeling he doesn't like me.
 McNARY / We know you're dealing with The Fat Man, Dixon. Take it from a friend; it doesn't help your case.
 PICARD / I'll keep it in mind.
 PICARD / Thank you. For helping me.
 McNARY / Forget it. (pats Picard's shoulder) When you comin' over for supper? The kids'd love to see you, and you know how much you love Sharon's cooking.
 PICARD / (thoughtful smile) Soon, my friend. But at the moment I have other duties.
 McNARY / Blonde or brunette?
 PICARD / (choosing his words) She's a lady all right... and her name's Enterprise.
 McNARY / Sounds like a working girl. (laughs) I'll stop by the office with a bottle of scotch. You can tell me all about her.
 WHALEN / Have a good time?
 PICARD / I'm not sure. Sometimes it seemed too real. (to Beverly) Glad you could make it. (looks her up and down) I must say, you wear it well.
 BEVERLY / (sly smile) Why thank you, Mister Hill.
 PICARD / I think it's time we got back to the Enterprise.
 WHALEN / (good-natured) We are on the Enterprise, Captain.
 PICARD / (chuckling) Yes. Of course we are.
 BEVERLY / Do we have time to see your office?
 PICARD / I don't see why not.
 PICARD / The Holodeck makes excellent use of a finite space.
 LEECH / Ah, Mister Hill. You've been avoiding me.
 WHALEN / (to Picard) It's Felix Leech! It has to be.
 LEECH / You know me, sir?
 WHALEN / Well, I've read about you. Many times.
 PICARD / I'm sorry Mister Leech, but we really must be going. Call again tomorrow.
 LEECH / You're being quite rude, Mister Hill. You haven't even introduced me to your charming companions.
 PICARD / That'll have to wait.
 LEECH / (raising voice) We have business! Urgent business.
 LEECH / (continuing) You're not going anywhere. Not until we have a little chat.
 TASHA / Bridge to Holodeck. We're approaching Torona Four.
 RIKER / Any word from the Jarada?
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Not a thing, sir.
 RIKER / They may be testing us. Seeing if we'll stick to the arrangements.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / What do we do now, sir?
 WORF / We wait.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Everything checks out so far. Ensign Crusher believes the trouble may have been caused by the Jaradan probe. If so, it could be very difficult to locate.
 LEECH / (perturbed) I'm not a man to be toyed with, Mister Hill. You were hired to locate a certain object. I demand to know what you've done with it.
 PICARD / I can't help you, Mister Leech. I'm afraid this game is over.
 LEECH / I assure you, this is no game!
 WHALEN / (laughing) Take it from me Leech, you'll never find it. (moves toward him) Now... give me the gun.
 WHALEN / (continuing; softly) But... they're not real.
 BEVERLY / This man has been shot. If we don't get him to Sickbay, he'll die.
 BEVERLY / There's massive internal bleeding --
 PICARD / How could this happen?
 LEECH / It'll happen again if you don't cooperate.
 LEECH / (continuing) You struck me! How dare you!
 LEECH / (continuing; almost hyperventilating) You'll be sorry! The Fat Man isn't going to like this!
 BEVERLY / We have to get him to Sickbay!
 PICARD / (to computer) Exit!
 PICARD / (continuing) Computer! Exit!
 PICARD / (continuing) We'll try the other exit.
 DATA / Computer! Identify exit!
 DATA / There is a programming malfunction. The computer refuses to identify the exits.
 BEVERLY / I'm losing his pulse!
 PICARD / Computer, this is the captain! Identify exit!
 RIKER / Standard orbit, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Aye sir, standard orbit.
 RIKER / Riker to Holodeck.
 GEORDI / (trace of frustration) Nothing yet, Commander.
 RIKER / We're running out of time.
 BEVERLY / It's no use. It's just not here anymore.
 PICARD / Suggestions, Mister Data?
 DATA / I am at a loss. We are in a Holodeck-created building of 1941. The computer has refused to accept voice commands. The controls for the environment are therefore not accessible. They are outside in the reality of the Holodeck.
 BEVERLY / I could use some light.
 REDBLOCK / (gravelly, clipped British accent) Good day, Mister Hill. My name is Cyrus Redblock. I hope you don't mind us dropping in.
 PICARD / I see I have no choice.
 REDBLOCK / (explosive laugh) Life is an endless stream of choices. Unfortunately, you have chosen to make my life more difficult.
 REDBLOCK / (continuing) I don't suppose you'd be foolish enough to hide it here.
 PICARD / I don't suppose so.
 REDBLOCK / Still, I'm sure you won't mind if we take a look around.
 BEVERLY / I wish you'd quit asking, since it's obvious you're going to do it anyway. It's a big waste of time.
 REDBLOCK / Good manners, Madam, are never a waste. (to Picard and Data) Civility, gentlemen. Always civility.
 REDBLOCK / (continuing; to thug) Get that stiff out of here.
 BEVERLY / He's not dead.
 REDBLOCK / From his pallor, he soon will be.
 REDBLOCK / The next room will do nicely for now.
 REDBLOCK / (continuing; to Leech) Which one struck you?
 LEECH / (indignant) It was Hill.
 REDBLOCK / For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. A truism that you have sadly neglected.
 McNARY / (to Picard) I saw your light and figured you were working late. (looks around room) Guess I was right.
 McNARY / (continuing; cool) Nice company you're keeping, Dix. You forget to take the trash out this morning?
 REDBLOCK / I'm a tolerant man, but I don't tolerate disrespect.
 DATA / Your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable, sir. However, your methods leave much to be desired.
 REDBLOCK / What have we here?
 LEECH / Looks like a ghost.
 REDBLOCK / Where do you suppose he's from?
 LEECH / Where were you hatched, anyway?
 DATA / Central America.
 REDBLOCK / (fascinated, half-whisper) I've been all over this world and I must say, I've not seen anything like you.
 PICARD / He's not from this world. None of us are.
 PICARD / (continuing) We come from a world of fabulous riches. A world of objects -- far greater in value than the one you seek.
 LEECH / (to Picard, angry) That's ridiculous! You're a private dick. We've met before and you never mentioned any of this.
 McNARY / He's right, Dix. That's pretty weak stuff. I can't even buy that line of guff.
 PICARD / I am not Dixon Hill.
 BEVERLY / (to others) He's not!
 PICARD / I only look like Dixon Hill.
 DATA / (to Redblock) He speaks the truth, sir. From your point of view, he is only a fiction, a facsimile, a knock-off, a cheap imitation.
 PICARD / Thank you, Mister Data.
 DATA / (to Picard, chagrined) Sorry sir, that did not come out quite the way I interded.
 REDBLOCK / Very good. Very, very, good. What wonderful fiction! Quite entertaining. I admire your skill at trying to obfuscate our sense of reality.
 DATA / It is you who are not real, sir.
 PICARD / Data--
 DATA / (innocently) It is you who are imaginary characters derived from a work of fiction.
 McNARY / Give it up, fellas. These guys are too smart to fall for that story.
 DATA / (apologetic) I am afraid you are not real either, Lieutenant.
 LEECH / I don't want to hear any more of this! You're making me crazy!
 PICARD / Deep down, you all sense the truth. Deep down, you know you're not real. All of you.
 LEECH / (waving gun) Shut up!! (growing frantic) Let me shoot them, Mister Redblock. Let me kill them, one by one.
 REDBLOCK / (analytical) A most interesting situation. Perhaps we should test this theory by killing one of them.
 BEVERLY / You've already done that! This man is dying! This whole thing is senseless!
 REDBLOCK / Hardly! Senseless killing is immoral. But killing for a purpose is often ingenious.
 LEECH / Well said, Mister Redblock. What's our purpose?
 REDBLOCK / We are on a quest for knowledge, Mister Leech. (to Picard) We want the item.
 PICARD / We don't have it.
 LEECH / Shall I kill him?
 REDBLOCK / No, kill the woman!
 PICARD / Redblock. I have the item.
 REDBLOCK / At last. I knew it! God, man, you are a character! Waiting until the last moment! Testing my resolve! What an ally you would make! Now -- where is it?
 PICARD / I'll explain. But first, tell Leech to back off.
 REDBLOCK / Put the gun down, Mister Leech.
 LEECH / But I want to kill her!
 REDBLOCK / Perhaps later. It won't harm us to listen to Mister Hill.
 REDBLOCK / (to Picard) Begin. Make your thoughts fruitful and your words eloquent. (rumbling laugh) Your lovely friend's life depends upon it.
 PICARD / There is a price.
 REDBLOCK / By God, man, I knew we were of the same stripe. Name it.
 PICARD / Mister Whalen's life. You must help us save him.
 RIKER / What the devil --
 TASHA / Probes! I'm reading several of them, sir. All locked on to us.
 WORF / Verified. Coming from the Jaradans!
 RIKER / (angry) Open hailing frequencies.
 TASHA / Frequencies open, sir.
 RIKER / This is Commander Riker, aboard the Enterprise. We demand that you --
 RIKER / (continuing; holding ears) Cut that off!
 GEORDI / (into Com) Lieutenant La Forge to bridge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker here.
 GEORDI / Is everything all right, sir? We felt quite a surge down here --
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes. Status report.
 GEORDI / We think we have something, sir. I'll let Ensign Crusher explain.
 WESLEY / (speaking up) I've found three --
 RIKER / Forget the explanation! Can you repair it?
 WESLEY / I don't know if I should. If this isn't done correctly, the program could abort and everyone inside could vanish.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Do you need more time to study it?
 WESLEY / No, sir. Whether we do it now or later, the risk will be the same.
 RIKER / Do it.
 PICARD / (passionate, to Redblock) If we can find the way of getting him to our Sickbay by fixing our computer --
 REDBLOCK / Computer? I do not know this word.
 DATA / -- A mechanical or electronic apparatus capable of carrying out repetitious and highly complex mathematical operations at high speed.
 DATA (O.S.) / Computers are used to control, perform, process, or store --
 LEECH / Enough! (to Redblock) Let me kill him. He's beginning to irritate me.
 DATA / (indicating wall) Captain, the exit...
 PICARD / (to Redblock) That's it! The way into our world.
 REDBLOCK / Remarkable. Is this a two-way passage? Can one enter your world and return to this one simply by stepping through?
 PICARD / Yes. Allow us to help Mister Whalen, and we'll return with the item.
 REDBLOCK / (to Picard) By God, sir, you are a scamp! To think that I would wait here --
 DATA / If you are thinking of going through yourself sir, I can assure you that is not possible.
 REDBLOCK / Not possible! (laughs again) One look at you sir, proves anything is possible.
 REDBLOCK / Stand back, Mister Hill. I would shoot you myself, but I don't want to rob my assistant of his greatest pleasure.
 REDBLOCK / (to thug) After we've gone, kill them all. Make sure no one ever finds the bodies.
 McNARY / You're insane! You think you can kill a cop and get away with it?
 REDBLOCK / Why not? I've done it before. Come, Mister Leech.
 REDBLOCK / (continuing; dramatic) Our destiny awaits. (to Picard) Au revoir et bon chance, mon ami!
 REDBLOCK / (whisper) Another world. (louder) A whole new world to plunder!
 LEECH / (flat) Uh-oh. REDBLOCK / (irritated) What is it?
 REDBLOCK / Nooo!! I want to live!! I want--
 GEORDI / (into Com) We've done it, but still no sign of them.
 GEORDI / Should we go inside?
 PICARD / (to Data, indicating Exit) Pick him up. Get him to Sickbay.
 DATA / What about you?
 PICARD / I'll follow you. Now go!
 PICARD / I can't think of a way to thank you. You know I can't take you with me.
 PICARD / (empathetic) I have to go.
 McNARY / So this is the big good-bye.
 McNARY / Tell me something, Dixon. (worried) When you've gone.... will this world still exist?.. Will my wife and kids still be waiting for me at home?
 PICARD / (pause, sadly) I honestly don't know. Good-bye my friend.
 TASHA / Captain!
 RIKER / Are you ready, sir?
 PICARD / As ready as I'll ever be. Open hailing frequencies.
 TASHA / Frequencies open.
 PICARD / (into com, commandingly) This is Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the USS Enterprise. Aaaaard kraxon Leeeeesss...
 PICARD / Risssssss... Trassssss.... Trasulah!
 RIKER / (nonchalant) So... Have a nice vacation?
 PICARD / It was a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to die there.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41242.4. Our last assignment has taken us into the remote Omicron Theta star system, home of our android crewmember Lieutenant Commander Data. Although we are due...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... at our next assignment, I have decided to increase velocity to warp eight to visit Data's home planet for a few hours in the hopes of unraveling some of the mystery of his beginnings.
 GEORDI turns to RIKER. / 
 GEORDI / Sir, we are now twenty minutes from Omicron Theta... (checks reading) ... mark!
 RIKER / Stand by for subwarp; head for standard orbit of Data's planet. (to Picard) Wonder why Data hasn't come up here.
 PICARD / He said he wanted to be alone. Perhaps it's a bigger moment for him than we thought. (turns to Wesley) If he needs a formal invitation, Ensign, you do the honors.
 WESLEY / (to his feet) Yes sir!
 PICARD / Walk!
 WESLEY / (excitedly) Data... !
 WESLEY / (continuing) What are you doing?
 DATA / Sneezing.
 WESLEY / Have you got a... a "cold?"
 DATA / A cold what?
 WESLEY / It's a disease my mother says people used to get.
 DATA / (nods) Ah. But humans still sneeze for other reasons and I cannot seem to do it right.
 WESLEY / How can you be practicing sneezing when you're arriving for the first time at your home planet? Aren't you interested in that?
 DATA / More than interested. Fascinated. One might say agog. But I find sneezing interesting also.
 TASHA / (checking readings) Confirming Class M reading there. But... (checks readings) ... but the sensors aren't showing any life readings. Not even vegetation.
 PICARD / Strange. The cruiser that found Data reported farmland here.
 RIKER / Want to take her into orbit, Data?
 DATA / No thank you, sir.
 PICARD / Continue on into close parking orbit.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 DATA / (beat; to Picard) I could say "home, sweet home," sir... if I understood how the word sweet applies.
 PICARD / It usually refers to the memories.
 RIKER / But usually one's own memories, Captain. (to Data) Do the memories you were given include "farms?"
 DATA / Affirmative, sir. Turning soil, seeding, harvesting... but the colony's principal interest was science.
 TASHA / Data, I can't understand how you can hold the memories of four hundred eleven people. If that means every experience, every day they lived...
 DATA / It does not, unfortunately. It means only the knowledge they had accumulated. Actually, I am quite deficient in some basic human information. (to Picard) Sneezing, for example.
 PICARD / "Sneezing?"
 GEORDI / Approaching close parking orbit, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Assemble your away party, Commander.
 PICARD / (continuing) This is an exciting moment for you, Data. I'm tempted to lead the away team down myself, except for the fact the first officer would object...
 RIKER / How would Starfleet judge me if I didn't, sir? An entire Earth colony did disappear down there.
 WORF / (to Data) You have no memory at all of what happened to them, Data?
 DATA / My final memory is of great danger, something sudden and not understood... then a blank as if the colonists were gone.
 GEORDI / Now in close parking orbit, sir.
 PICARD / Welcome home, Mister Data.
 TASHA / (to Riker) Recording signal now locked onto the Enterprise, sir.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) This looks like anything but farmland.
 GEORDI / Agreed, sir. The soil here's completely lifeless.
 RIKER / This is the exact position listed in the Tripoli log. (turning Do you recognize anything, Data?
 DATA / The land contours are familiar, sir. Topographically, this is the correct area.
 GEORDI / This once was rich farmland. I'd guess something like twenty to thirty years ago...
 DATA / I was discovered twenty-six years ago...
 GEORDI / (still sifting soil) There is still plant cellulose in the soil. No signs of decay. Also no signs of bacteria either. (looks up) If you don't mind a wild guess, sir, I'd say everything on this planet could have been dead or dying at the time Data was found.
 RIKER / The Tripoli log stated that all plant life appeared brown and "dormant." They assumed it was normal for that season.
 GEORDI / ... whereas actually everything was dying...
 DATA / (interrupting; indicating) I was found twenty meters in that direction, sir.
 TASHA / (moving alongside Data) Data, any idea at all why you were given the colonists' memories?
 DATA / I have always felt that it was done hurriedly, but I know little more.
 DATA / (continuing) Here, sir. This is where the cruiser's landing party found the signal device that had led them here. (indicates) And they found me lying there, sir.
 TASHA / You were just lying out in the open? No identity record, no instructions... ?
 DATA / Only a layer of dust.
 DATA / (continuing) There's much more of it now, after twenty-six years.
 RIKER / What is the first thing you remember, Data?
 DATA / Opening my eyes and finding myself looking into the eyes of the Tripoli landing party, sir. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (indicating the path back) They believed that the signal device sensed their presence, and activated me.
 TASHA / Then this very spot was your birthplace...
 DATA / But not at all like a human birth. Having the colonists' memories, I knew immediately how to speak, who I was, where I was...
 TASHA / You were born and became fully knowledgeable at the same instant!
 DATA / I had no idea that was unusual, of course.
 TASHA / It's such a strange place to be born.
 RIKER / So was a manger.
 WORF / A "manger," sir?
 RIKER / I won't even try to explain that one, Worf...
 GEORDI / (calling) I understand now, sir! I've got this figured!
 GEORDI / (continuing) It was really very cleverly done to make this look like a natural hollow in the terrain here. Signs of it being constructed hurriedly...
 GEORDI / ... as if to hide something here.
 DATA / Yes, that was it, Geordi. (to Riker) This has awakened a memory remnant of how the colonists hoped to remain hidden... (beat; concentrating) ... but their fear of being discovered led to their storing information in me.
 GEORDI / Yes, I thought so.
 TASHA / No life readings in here either, sir.
 RIKER / The colony laboratory, I'd guess. Extremely well equipped. (to Data) Does this place stir any memories, Data?
 DATA / Only vague impressions of some of my functions being tested here, sir...
 RIKER / Posted by a proud parent...
 DATA / (continuing) This pictures something that feels familiar, sir. And dangerous, although I have no idea what it represents. And that is all...
 DATA / (continuing) ... except for an impression that this was a... "Doctor Soong's" work area.
 RIKER / Who? You can't mean Doctor Noonien Soong?
 DATA / (nods) He was called that here... although, his memories indicate he traveled here under a different name.
 GEORDI / Doctor Noonien Soong, my friend, just happens to have been Earth's foremost robotics scientist!
 TASHA / Until he tried to make Asimov's dream of a positronic brain come true.
 RIKER / (nodding) The positronic brain. He promised it would do so much. When it failed completely, Doctor Soong disappeared. (eyes Data) Now we know he went off somewhere to try a second time. (turns; indicating) Geordi, Data, we'll take a close look at this lab. (to Tasha) You and Lieutenant Worf reconnoiter where the rest of these corridors lead.
 GEORDI / (beat) Data... it's you.
 RIKER / An epidermal mold, I'd guess. Made to give your exterior the desired finish.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.
 RIKER / Come in, Lieutenant.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Sir... this installation is big enough to hold hundreds of people. But all that's here now is empty beds.
 RIKER / Thank you, Lieutenant. Complete your record scans, then report back here.
 GEORDI / Sir... (bends) Seems to be a storage area here...
 RIKER / How many more Datas are there?
 GEORDI / (looking around) Looks like just these two... (quickly apologetic) I mean that and the real Data.
 DATA / Commander, can this be another me? Or perhaps my brother?
 RIKER / I honestly don't know, Data.
 DATA / He needs assembling.
 RIKER / "He?" Data, we don't know that this could become "alive."
 DATA / It is of great interest to me to find out, sir. I never believed it possible I might have a link with some form like my own.
 RIKER / (beat; nods) Understood. We'll take it back to the ship, of course.
 TASHA / Captain, I have a subspace reply to your request. (turns to Picard) Starfleet considers it vital we begin our ship's computer upgrade at Starbase Armus Nine on schedule.
 PICARD / (annoyed) Damn. Can anyone see why they've turned down a perfectly legitimate request to finish this investigation here?
 WESLEY / (waits; then) Sir... you asked for the kind of computer upgrade that only the Bynars can handle. And they're available only at this time.
 PICARD / Then, get us there on schedule, Number One. (to Wesley; controlling self) Thank you, Wesley. I'd completely forgotten that.
 RIKER / Take us out of orbit, Mister La Forge.
 PICARD (V. O.) / (continuing) Captain's log, Stardate 41242.45. Despite having only a few hours in which to explore Data's home planet...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... we have discovered something which may explain Data's beginnings... if we can properly assemble and communicate with what we've found.
 BEVERLY / Signal from the captain. They need you at the debriefing.
 DATA / I've been anxious to hear the chief engineer's opinion, Mister Argyle. Do you believe he can be made to function?
 ARGYLE / It appears to include all the components in your body. Not that we really understand your construction either...
 BEVERLY / We'll have our top medical and engineering specialists working on its assembly, Mister Data.
 ARGYLE / Just... one thing. Without disassembling you, of course, if we should need...
 BEVERLY / ... If we should need to compare this with the way... uh, with the way you're put together... ?
 PICARD / Bringing it up here was the right thing to do, of course, Number One.
 PICARD / (continuing) I was just saying, Data, that if it functions, it might answer a lot of questions for us.
 RIKER / Does it appear to have all your... ah, parts?
 DATA / Completely, sir.
 GEORDI / (beat) Will we know how to... to "turn it on?"
 PICARD / All right, all right... (stands; hesitates, then) Legitimate questions about this need not be asked apologetically. (to Data) You're uncomfortable about aspects of your duplicate, Data... we're uncomfortable, too... and none of it for any logical reason. We know that you're as "alive" as any of the rest of us. (to the others) If you find it awkward to be reminded that Data is a "machine"... you might remember that the rest of you are merely a different variety of machine... in our case, electro-chemical in nature. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (sits) Let's begin handling this as we would anything else.
 GEORDI / Agreed! Love that captain!
 PICARD / (snaps) My comments, Lieutenant, do not require applause!
 GEORDI / Yes, sir; sorry, sir.
 PICARD / Let's start with you, Data.
 DATA / Well... a good starting point might be, "Why was I given human form?"
 GEORDI / To make it easy for humans to relate to you. Had to be. But your designer may have had something else to prove also.
 PICARD / (nods) That human-shaped robots need not be clumsy, limited things... (turning) You certainly operate as well as we do, Data...
 DATA / In some ways better, sir.
 PICARD / Ah... yes! But the important question now may be what happened to the colonists.
 RIKER / Agreed. (exhibits child's drawing) One of several exhibited in the lab, by proud parents, no doubt. This could be simply a child's imagination. But then, several children made similar drawings.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Doctor Crusher to Captain. At this point, sir, we very much need Mister Data's help.
 PICARD / He's on his way, Doctor.
 DATA / There, Doctor. Press your fingers there.
 DATA (O. S.) / It operates somewhat like a "switch," Doctor.
 BEVERLY / And these small projections?
 DATA / An android alarm clock, Doctor. Is that amusing? (sees it isn't) It times how long I remain unconscious.
 ARGYLE / Are you certain about us using these heating devices, Data?
 DATA / (nods) I will feel nothing at all.
 ARGYLE / (smiles) Marvelous. It should all be a lot simpler... once we can see how your circuitry's connected.
 BEVERLY / I'll mention it to no one. You have my word.
 DATA / If you had an off-switch Doctor... would you not keep it secret?
 BEVERLY / I probably would.
 ARGYLE / Yes, notice the micro-circuitry here... and here.
 ARGYLE (O.S.) / Then another fibroid-like connection here.
 BEVERLY / Let's close up.
 BEVERLY / If I've done it right, he'll switch on in a minute.
 ARGYLE / It seemed to go well... (indicates) ... thanks to a look inside Mister Data. But there have been no signs of consciousness, yet...
 RIKER / Certainly a perfect match for Data, sir.
 PICARD / (uncertain) Do you think so, really? (leans in; inspects) I wonder which of them was made first?
 PICARD / I'm also a bit troubled by it describing you as "imperfect."
 DATA / Human language gives me difficulties too, sir. "Imperfect" could mean I lack abilities that he possesses.
 PICARD / I wonder. But the point of this is whether you and it have approximately the same capabilities.
 DATA / We do, sir, and your referring to him as an "it"... suggests I too fit into the category of a "thing."
 PICARD / I see your point, Commander. My sincere apologies.
 DATA / Gladly accepted, sir. As for Lore's abilities, his use of syntax and grammar suggests he was given human memories similar to mine.
 PICARD / You both have about equal physical strength and mental ability?
 DATA / I believe so, sir.
 PICARD / (troubled) Which requires I now ask you... a very serious question. Since the two of you are closely related to each other...
 DATA / The answer, sir, is that my loyalty is to you and Starfleet. Completely.
 PICARD / (beat; small smile) Thank you, Commander. I was certain of that.
 GEORDI / And Helm control are here, with the ship's heading given in measurements, we call them "degrees"... (indicating) ... with three hundred-sixty of them in a full circle this way.
 GEORDI / On the nose!
 WESLEY / Which separates it from another three hundred-sixty degree full circle like this... on a right angle to that one.
 RIKER / And the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle...
 DATA / All of which you can learn more about, when the captain has approved your being on the bridge.
 WESLEY / (pleasantly) You'll find as I have that starships are loaded with rules which have to be learned.
 WORF / Were you ever this anxious to please, Data?
 DATA / Never. I judge Lore to be superior in that desire as well.
 GEORDI / "My brother." That has a nice sound, Data.
 DATA / (to Lore) And you consider it important to please humans?
 DATA / (beat) There are many things of importance... some more so than others.
 DATA / My quarters.
 DATA / It can identify any of the crew. (eyes Lore) Just as I can identify flattery, brother.
 DATA / It is best used when it reflects genuine feelings.
 DATA / (beat) Do you realize Commander Riker's hypotenuse question tricked you into showing your knowledge was much greater than you were indicating?
 DATA / You tend to underestimate humans, my brother. The way you praised young Wesley at the Helm, for example...
 DATA / He has a child's body, but we have found him to be much more than that.
 DATA / I have no need for places to sit or sleep. Do you?
 DATA / Everything available on a Doctor Noonien Soong.
 DATA / (reading computer viewer) But had destroyed his own reputation by making what seemed wild promises about his positronic brain design... almost all of which failed.
 DATA / If you get one the way I did, Lore, it means four years at the Academy, another three as ensign, ten or twelve on varied space duty in the lieutenant grades...
 DATA / How?
 DATA / And will we also discuss which of us was constructed first?
 DATA / You lived with the colonists?
 DATA / (considers it; nods) Quite true. I keep trying to be more human... and keep failing.
 DATA / And... do you realize... Lore, that I am obligated to report all of this to our ship's captain?
 DATA / (nods) Use it also to describe for the captain the time you spent with the colonists. Including all you know about what happened to them.
 DATA / Thank you, Lore. And now, I have duties to perform, unless you need something more.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41242.5. We now have the full story of the micro-engineering achievement which produced Data... and Lore...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... and of the tragedy which deprived humanity of the remarkable minds behind that. Our first clue was a child's drawing which showed a great, complex crystal shape...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... confirmed by Lore's report to be an unknown kind of creature, capable of stripping all life from an entire world... insatiably ravenous for the life force found in intelligent forms like us... which Lore explains it stored in new crystal patterns... for purposes which are unknown.
 TASHA / But how did Data escape that thing? Or Lore?
 RIKER / Lore had been disassembled. He explains it as jealousy from the colonists. And Data wasn't yet "alive" at that time.
 PICARD / Which explains why Data could be left outside in no danger from the creature. Whatever happened to the colonists, he would be found by any Starfleet team that responded to the signal being transmitted.
 TASHA / By which Doctor Soong left proof behind that his experiment did work.
 RIKER / Captain, how believable do you find that crystal thing?
 PICARD / Having explored so little of just our galaxy, I find anything possible.
 TASHA / (overlapping; puzzled by readings) Data, are you expecting Lore to come up here? He left your quarters some time ago.
 DATA / To go... ?
 TASHA / My Turbo-sensors say he went to Deck One... (turning to Worf) Worf?
 WORF / ... where he examined some microminiature work tools, then some... (squints at her Viewer) ... fine grind quadratanium... ?
 DATA / Which is used in our construction. (to Picard) That particular compound is no more suspicious, sir, than a human looking for an antiseptic or an ointment. Nevertheless, I should check it out.
 BEVERLY / You're watching everything he does, Data? Is that the act of a brother?
 PICARD / The act of a Starfleet officer obeying his captain, Doctor.
 TASHA / Speaking strictly as security chief, Captain... how much can you trust Data now?
 PICARD / I trust him completely, Lieutenant! (then softer) But everyone should also realize you just asked a necessary and legitimate security question.
 TASHA / Thank you for explaining that, sir.
 DATA / Champagne?
 DATA / I have some doubts about the value of human... customs in this...my... brother...
 DATA / (thickly) Brother... help me...
 WORF / This is strange, sir. I show Mister Data transmitting on a subspace channel.
 RIKER / He's been doing considerable research on Doctor Soong's background... but let's be sure. (turns) Wesley, can you look in on him discreetly?
 WESLEY / (coming to his feet instantly) Yes sir!
 WESLEY / Why did he do that, Data?
 WESLEY / I'd suggest you forget imitating him... (smiles) ... because if you had said "We've been using the sensors," instead if "we have," I might have suspected you were Lore.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / You're certain he said he'll be right up?
 WESLEY / He indicated that, sir.
 TASHA / Sensors show Data just now entering a turbolift, sir.
 BEVERLY / (to Wesley) Wes, tell me again how Data said he immobilized Lore.
 WESLEY / He said he "turned him off," Mom... (quick correction) ... uh, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / (quietly) Question, Mister Data... did you or did you not swear me to secrecy about your "off switch?"
 GEORDI / (interrupting; to Picard) Sir! I'm picking up a "bogey" coming in on a five o'clock tangent.
 WESLEY / Confirm! And so fast it makes our warp eight look like we're standing still!
 TASHA / It's transmitting no ID signal, Captain...
 RIKER / Set Main Viewer on that tangent.
 PICARD / Shields up; go to Yellow Alert! Transmit friendly greetings, all languages, all frequencies.
 RIKER / I can't believe anything overtaking us this fast.
 RIKER / I recognize it, Captain... it's similar to that child's drawing...
 BEVERLY / My God, it's big!
 TASHA / Still no ID transmitted, sir. Also, no answer to our inquiries.
 PICARD / Did you have a direct look at it?
 GEORDI / It's like a snowflake crystal, sir. But much more complex... the entire electromagnetic spectrum seems to play about inside it... (seeing Picard's look) I haven't the slightest idea what it is, sir.
 PICARD / Data, anything else Lore can tell us about it may be important. Can you control Lore enough to question him?
 WESLEY / Captain, recommend you do not let... (hesitates) ... him move around the ship alone.
 PICARD / Ensign... !
 WESLEY / Not if I have a choice.
 PICARD / That is quite enough, Ensign! When addressing a senior officer...
 RIKER / (interrupting) I've guided his training; I'm the one at fault, sir. (to Wesley) You will show proper courtesy, and I'm taking you down there to make certain of it! (to Picard) With your approval, of course, sir.
 RIKER / And bring it to the bridge. Immediately!
 PICARD / Well, Number One?
 RIKER / Sir, it's Lore... with the same facial twitch we've all seen... lying unconscious exactly as Data described. But he became violent, apparently sensing that Wesley and I were present...
 WESLEY / (interrupting) Or is it Lore pretending to be Data, and faking it all?
 PICARD / I asked for Commander Riker's report, "Acting Ensign" Crusher. And since it is now clear you are unable to function here within the limits of that appointment...
 GEORDI / Captain!
 TASHA / Deflector shields holding, sir.
 PICARD / (keeping voice calm) Bring photon torpedoes to ready; main phasers to ready...
 PICARD / (continuing: to Riker) Go to Red Alert, please.
 WORF / (raising voice over it) Weapons now ready, sir!
 PICARD / (interrupting) Why didn't you say you could?
 PICARD / (continuing) Affirmative! Talk to it!
 GEORDI / Now I call that communicating.
 WORF / But he mentioned "changing us," Captain. What does that mean?
 RIKER / Which you'll beam over next to the entity...
 PICARD / Make it so!
 PICARD / Do it!
 WESLEY / Sir, I know this may finish me as an acting ensign, but...
 PICARD / Shut up, Wesley. (turning) Lieutenant Yar, pick a good security team, let me know what he does.
 BEVERLY / "Shut up, Wesley?"
 PICARD / Stay out of this, Madam...
 WESLEY / Since I am finished here, Captain, may I point out... ?
 BEVERLY / Shut up, Wesley!
 WESLEY / (still to Picard) ... that what I've said would have been listened to if it came from an adult officer. Request permission to return to my quarters, sir.
 PICARD / Granted, if you take your mother with you.
 BEVERLY / (flaring) You're putting me off the bridge?
 PICARD / I'm asking that you keep an eye on your son during this, Doctor.
 WESLEY / Please, Mom. Let's go.
 BEVERLY / I'll look, but I should never have let you talk me into this...
 WESLEY / It's Data, Mom. He's been hurt!
 WESLEY / It's Data! For once will you trust me about something?
 WESLEY / (continuing) You must know how much Starfleet means to me. But I'm finished unless you can help me. (touches her arm) I heard you know how to turn them on. Please?
 BEVERLY / No, this is very serious...
 WESLEY / I know, Mom. So tell me again to "shut up, Wesley," and I will.
 BEVERLY / You're being very unfair, Wesley...
 WESLEY / Data, the Crystal Thing is outside close to the ship... and Lore is loose somewhere inside.
 BEVERLY / How badly are you hurt... Data?
 DATA / I will function sufficiently to stop Lore, Doctor...
 DATA / Whatever happens, it is important that you two stay away from him. Do not try to help me.
 DATA / How sad, dear brother. You have made me wish I were an only child.
 BEVERLY / If you take one step toward my son...
 BEVERLY / Move away, Data, please!
 DATA / I will stay with Wesley, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / I'll bring help, Wesley.
 WESLEY / Mom!
 DATA / Stay back, Wesley! Help me some other way!
 DATA / Wesley... now!
 WESLEY / (to Picard) Lore's gone, sir, permanently!
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Now that your son's safe, Doctor, report immediately to Sickbay.
 RIKER / Captain... The crystal thing has begun to move away.
 PICARD / (continuing; beat; eyeing him) Data, get rid of that damned twitch! And put on a correct uniform.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / And Ensign Crusher... (as Wesley HURRIES IN) ... are you able to return to duty now?
 WESLEY / Yes, sir!
 PICARD / Then do so! Let the bridge know all is well down here.
 RIKER / It's gone, sir. Without Lore, it had no way to reach us.
 PICARD / (nods) And we're overdue for our computer refit. (beat) Number One, have you ever considered whether Data is more human, or less human than we want?
 RIKER / (grins) I only wish we were as well balanced, sir.
 PICARD / (beat; nods) Agreed!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41636.9. As feared, our examination of the seven year overdue Federation freighter, Odin -- disabled by an asteroid collision -- revealed no survivors.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) However, three escape pods were missing, suggesting the possibility of survivors...
 The Green Planet is featured on the Main Viewer. PICARD, GEORDI, DATA, RIKER, TASHA and TROI at their / stations.
 GEORDI / Ready to begin orbit of Angel One, Captain.
 PICARD / Make it so, Mister La Forge. What kind of place is this, Data?
 DATA / Angel One is a class M planet, supporting carbon-based flora and fauna, sparsely populated with intelligent life forms... similar in technological development to mid-twentieth-century Earth.
 GEORDI / Just like being marooned at home.
 RIKER / Assuming any survivors made it this far. Admittedly, it's the closest planet to the Odin. But the distance we've traveled in the past two days at warp one would've taken the Odin escape pods five months.
 DATA / Five months, fourteen days, eleven hours, two minutes --
 RIKER / Thank you, Data.
 DATA / -- and fifty-seven seconds.
 TASHA / Captain, we're receiving an audio signal from Angel One.
 PICARD / Starfleet was quite adamant that we maintain excellent diplomatic relations with this planet. Any other pertinent information before we reply, Mister Data? Their form of government would be a logical starting place.
 DATA / Angel One has evolved into a constitutional oligarchy. It is governed by a parliamentary body consisting of six elected Mistresses, and headed by a female they refer to as "The Elected One."
 TROI / It sounds very much like my own planet.
 WORF / (aside to Data) Klingons appreciate strong women.
 RIKER / How current is your information, Data?
 DATA / A Federation vessel last visited this planet sixty-two years ago, Captain.
 PICARD / Except, let us hope, for the Odin escape pods. (then:) Since this is a female-dominated society, it might be more prudent if you made the initial contact, Counselor.
 TROI / (nods, and:) Please open hailing frequencies.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open.
 TROI / This is Counselor Deanna Troi of the USS Enterprise.
 TROI / The Federation has neglected a visit to your planet for far too long. With your permission, we would like to correct that oversight.
 BEATA'S COM VOICE / We feel in no way neglected, Counselor. A diplomatic courtesy call is neither expected nor required.
 TROI / We also come in search of possible survivors from one of our freighters.
 BEATA'S COM VOICE / A brief visit will be tolerated.
 TASHA / They've broken off transmission.
 GEORDI / Ever feel like you're not really wanted?
 PICARD / That's their prerogative, Lieutenant. (then:) Prepare the away team, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, aye, sir.
 WESLEY and a BUDDY converge on the Holodeck entrance. / As WE FOLLOW this excited twosome, WE PICK UP Riker (carrying a METALLIC BOX) Troi, Data and Tasha APPROACHING from the opposite direction.
 RIKER / Where're you boys off to?
 WESLEY / Skiing, sir. Our instructor has us scheduled for the Swiss Alps, sir.
 RIKER / Save us some deep powder.
 WESLEY / No problem, sir. The Holodeck has all you'll ever need.
 RIKER / The away team is ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Angel One's position in this quadrant may become strategically vital. The hope at Starfleet is that some day this planet could become a part of the Federation.
 RIKER / We'll try to make a good impression, Captain.
 PICARD / Energize!
 BEATA / See that these matters are handled immediately.
 TRENT / As you wish, Mistress.
 BEATA / I am Beata, The Elected One of Angel One.
 TROI / Mistress Beata, I am Counselor Troi. (refers to metal box) We've brought you a small token of our goodwill.
 BEATA / My cooperation is not for sale, Counselor.
 TROI / We didn't mean to imply that it was, Mistress. (beat, and:) Out of respect to your wishes that we keep our visit brief, perhaps you would like to address the issue of survivors immediately.
 BEATA / (curtly) Immediately -- but not impetuously. You will present your case.
 BEATA / (continuing) Until I am certain of your intentions, I know of no such survivors.
 BEATA / Representatives of the Starship Enterprise -- do you wish to petition the Parliament of Angel One?
 TROI / We do. We have reason to hope that survivors from a damaged Federation freighter may be marooned on your planet. We are seeking to learn if this is so.
 BEATA / Even a planet as remote as Angel One has heard of Starfleet. Searching the galaxy for survivors seems a petty task for one of their mighty vessels.
 RIKER / We don't consider even one survivor petty.
 BEATA / (to Troi, offended) Is this man suggesting that we place a lesser value on life than you do?
 TROI / Not at all.
 TROI / (continuing) Our discovery of the abandoned freighter was an accident, Mistress Beata. We have a duty to investigate.
 BEATA / I see. And if you were to find survivors? What then?
 TROI / We will take them with us. See that they are reunited with their families.
 BEATA / Yes, Ariel?
 BEATA / A good question.
 TASHA / What reason could we possibly have to deceive you?
 BEATA / Another good question.
 RIKER / Are there survivors from the freighter Odin on this planet?
 BEATA / After we discuss that matter, we'll let you know.
 BEATA / (continuing; to Trent) See to their comforts.
 TRENT / You will remain here until summoned.
 RIKER / Are we able to talk? Is the area secure?
 TASHA / Yes. Tricorder doesn't show any listening devices or anything else of a threatening nature
 RIKER / Good. Troi?
 TROI / There was much fear in that room.
 RIKER / Paranoia, if you ask me. But of what?
 TROI / I cannot say. Nor do I feel their fear was focused. I sensed that all were not concerned for the same reason.
 RIKER / Data?
 DATA / There are undoubtedly survivors from the Odin on this planet, Commander.
 RIKER / I agree. Otherwise, why would they be so circumspect?
 TASHA / As the Mistress Beata is so fond of saying -- good question.
 DATA / What do we do if they elect to deny the existence of any survivors?
 RIKER / Let's not look for problems.
 PICARD / I want all departments prepared for a warp six trip to the Neutral Zone as soon as the away team completes its mission.
 WORF / Trouble, Captain?
 PICARD / Insurance. Romulan battlecruisers have been detected near one of our border posts. They've requested assistance as soon as we are available.
 WESLEY / Captain Picard!
 PICARD / Report, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / We, ah, finished our ski lesson, sir... and it kinda just happened, sir.
 PICARD / On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher, nothing "just happens." (distracted) What is that smell?
 WORF / (sniffs, and:) Hmm, yes... slightly reminiscent of Night-Blooming Throgni, Captain. From home. (deep breath) Quite stimulating, wouldn't you say?
 PICARD / No.
 WESLEY / I can't smell anything. I'm a little congested...
 PICARD / Don't let this "just happen" again, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / (snapping to) Yes, sir!!
 DATA / Interesting. An alcohol-based synthetic, artificially reproducing a floral scent.
 TROI / It is called perfume, Data.
 DATA / The purpose of which is... ?
 TASHA / Certain cultures consider perfume an aphrodisiac.
 DATA / I am unfamiliar with that term.
 RIKER / An aphrodisiac is something designed to stimulate or enhance sexual pleasure.
 DATA / How does stimulation of the olfactory nerve affect the enjoyment of sex?
 TRENT / The Elected One will see you now.
 BEATA / You claim you intend to remove these survivors from our planet. Are you prepared to give us your solemn word on that?
 TROI / We are.
 BEATA / You should know that the vote was not unanimous. Some among us are suspicious.
 BEATA / Yet, the majority feel that we have no choice but to trust you.
 RIKER / We don't understand the source of your misgivings, Mistress, but we appreciate your faith in us.
 BEATA / (sharply) Make certain that our faith has not been misplaced. (then:) There are four survivors from the ship you call the Odin. All male. Their leader is a man who calls himself Ramsey.
 RIKER / If you'll bring these men to us, we'll have them off your planet immediately.
 BEATA / If they were mine to deliver, I would do so without hesitation. Unfortunately, their hiding place has long eluded us.
 TASHA / Hiding place? Why are they in hiding?
 BEATA / Because they are fugitives on Angel One! And the sooner we are rid of them, the better! (calming down) When these men arrived seven years ago, they accepted our hospitality quickly enough. But gradually, they grew restive. Making unreasonable demands, going against the natural order -- there seemed to be no end to the trouble they created.
 TROI / Using the technology of the Enterprise, we might be able to find these men.
 BEATA / I assumed as much. But be warned, Counselor -- (beat, and:) -- these men are dangerous.
 BEVERLY administers hypo shots to Wesley's buddy who / is laid out on a bed next to Wesley as:
 WESLEY / (suffering) This is worse than Hesperan Thumping Cough. What is it, Mom?
 BEVERLY / You and your friend probably picked up something on the Quazulu Eight field trip last week. Whatever it is may have been activated by your exposure to the cold ski environment of the Holodeck.
 WESLEY / But the transporter biofilter is supposed to kill stuff like that.
 BEVERLY / If this is our first contact, it wouldn't have been programmed into the biofilter computer yet.
 WESLEY / (getting sleepy) Mom...
 BEVERLY / Sickbay to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Picard here.
 BEVERLY / Wesley and one of his friends have contracted some form of respiratory ailment -- most likely a viral infection.
 PICARD / Is it contained?
 BEVERLY / I believe so. I've isolated the twelve students who were on the field trip where I believe the problem began.
 PICARD / How contagious is it?
 BEVERLY / Unknown. Nor do I have a clue as to how it's transmitted.
 PICARD / Please stay with it, Doctor. Starfleet has important business for us as soon as the away team returns. I don't relish having my crew infected.
 BEVERLY / At the moment, my only suggestion is that all crew avoid any cold-weather Holodeck simulations until further notice.
 PICARD / Agreed. And keep me advised.
 RIKER / Data, how can we best go about finding Mister Ramsey and the other survivors?
 DATA / Assuming the survivors have retained some remnants of their lives aboard the Odin, we might not have a difficult task. If we can isolate something unique to the survivors -- perhaps an element not otherwise found on Angel One -- we can utilize the Enterprise scanners.
 RIKER / (to Beata) Mister Data will need access to your library.
 BEATA / Our library is far too sophisticated for a man to comprehend.
 DATA / I am an android, Mistress, though anatomically, I am a fully functioning male.
 BEATA / An amusing notion. Perhaps you could teach our males a thing or two. (with a look) Trent -- see to the android's needs.
 BEATA / Do not forget your promise.
 WORF / Bridge to Captain Picard.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Lieutenant.
 WORF / The away team has requested that we scan the planet surface for traces of platinum.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Have Mister La Forge break fixed orbit and initiate a search pattern.
 WORF / Aye, Captain. (and:) Geordi.
 GEORDI / Search pattern initiated now.
 PICARD / This is all quite unnecessary, Doctor. (suppressing the pain) I'm merely fatigued.
 BEVERLY / Because you are very ill, Captain. You have the virus. (in full stature) Captain, in my opinion, you are no longer physically able to effectively command this vessel.
 PICARD / Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. I've got an away team down there, in less-than-friendly territory, not to mention an appointment with the several Romulan battlecruisers...
 BEVERLY / You have an appointment in your cabin, Captain. With your bed.
 PICARD / Is that an order?
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 PICARD / I guess I'm better at giving orders than taking them.
 WORF / (stuffy nose) I think I may sneeze...
 GEORDI / A Klingon sneeze?!
 WORF / Only kind I know.
 PICARD / Lieutenant La Forge -- you have command until further notice. Please make the proper entries in the ship's log.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 WORF / Scanners indicate a platinum trace. Should I notify the away team?
 GEORDI / Make it so.
 RIKER / The Enterprise reports a possible location for Mister Ramsey and the other survivors.
 BEATA / So soon? I'm impressed with your haste.
 BEATA / You've had your opportunity to object, Ariel. You were in the minority.
 RIKER / With your permission, we'd like to begin our search immediately.
 BEATA / By all means. (rising) But I'm sure that Counselor Troi and the others can do that without you. (off his reaction) If I recall, you had a gesture of goodwill you wished to give me... ?
 RIKER / That can certainly wait until we've recovered the survivors.
 BEATA / Are you suggesting that the women in your party are incapable of performing this task without the help of a man?
 RIKER / Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and Counselor Troi are completely qualified.
 BEATA / (sarcastically) How generous you are with your praise. (an order) Inform them you will remain here with me.
 RIKER / (a beat) Riker to Lieutenant Yar.
 TASHA / This is Yar.
 RIKER / Tasha - you'll be leading the team without me.
 TASHA / (puzzled) Commander... ?
 RIKER / In the interest of diplomatic relations, I'll remain with Mistress Beata while you conduct your search.
 TASHA / Certainly, sir.
 BEATA / Relax. We have much to discuss.
 TASHA / Set phasers to stun.
 TROI / Is that really necessary?
 DATA / A justified precaution, Counselor. Mistress Beata observed that Mister Ramsey and his men were dangerous.
 TASHA / (into Com) Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Tasha.
 TASHA / Three to beam to the location of that platinum trace, Geordi.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Coordinates set.
 TASHA / Energize!
 RAMSEY / Welcome. I've been expecting you.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to bridge.
 WORF / Pardon me.
 GEORDI / La Forge here, Captain.
 PICARD / Status report, please.
 GEORDI / Eighty-two more reported cases of the virus, sir. Doctor Crusher has converted the Holodeck into an isolation ward.
 PICARD / And the --
 PICARD / (continuing) -- away team?
 GEORDI / No recent contact, Captain. But I've informed them of the medical situation up here and the growing Romulan threat to our Neutral Zone outpost.
 PICARD / Keep me-- (coughs) --advised. You'll have the bridge until Commander Riker returns.
 WORF / (congested) Engineering reports a computer malf...
 WORF / (continuing) Sorry, I'm... getting sick.
 GEORDI / I'm sure half the ship knows that by now. Report to Sickbay.
 GEORDI / La Forge here.
 GEORDI / I'm on my way.
 WORF / With all respect, Lieutenant, there are other people to do that job now.
 GEORDI / bridge to Engineering. Lieutenant Wong knows the system. I'm sure she'll be able to resolve all problems.
 GEORDI / Worf...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Thanks for the advice.
 TROI / We haven't much time, Mister Ramsey. The Enterprise has urgent business elsewhere.
 RAMSEY / Certainly we have time for a drink.
 RAMSEY / (continuing) How did you find me?
 DATA / Actually, it was quite simple. I accessed all possible elements available to the crew of the Odin, cross-referenced those to elements endemic to Angel One, then eliminated the common denominators. Angel One has no platinum. Enterprise scanners did the rest.
 RAMSEY / Platinum, was it?
 RAMSEY / (continuing) My wings. I kept them for their sentimental value.
 TASHA / Where are the other survivors, Mister Ramsey?
 RAMSEY / Oh, they're nearby. Packing, as a matter of fact, since we can no longer remain here. As the unofficial leader of our little group, I've been chosen to speak for us all.
 TROI / Marooned seven years on an alien planet. Rather than excitement or anticipation at being rescued, I sense a feeling of calm in you.
 RAMSEY / What is it you think you're rescuing me from? My shipmates and I have all taken wives. A few even have children. You can't "rescue" a man from the place he calls his home.
 RIKER / ... Why were you so hesitant at first to tell us about the Odin survivors?
 BEATA / Simply because Ramsey and his men are anarchists. Tampering with the laws of nature. Obsessed with spreading untruths, and encouraging dissent among our people. I had to be certain you weren't here to fuel their struggle.
 RIKER / It's not our place to interfere in the domestic affairs of other societies.
 BEATA / Not you, perhaps, because you understand a man's place. But Ramsey is not so well-mannered. (shakes her head) Sometimes I fear that it is actually the men who are the clever ones, enjoying all that life has to offer while we women devote ourselves to the drudgery of making life work.
 RIKER / In our society, men and women share equally in all that life has to offer.
 BEATA / Don't misunderstand me, Riker. I'd be the last to imply that men are in any way inferior to women. But, after all, men are... men -- with a natural place in the scheme of things.
 RIKER / (amused) We gave up those distinctions centuries ago. In our world, equality among the sexes is so well established, we no longer consider it an issue.
 BEATA / (humoring him) You deny that differences exist between men and women?
 RIKER / We not only acknowledge the differences. We delight in them.
 BEATA / That's so like a man. So emotional. What would we do without you... ?
 RIKER / Thank you, Trent.
 BEATA / You may go.
 RIKER / With compliments of the USS Enterprise.
 RIKER / It's called an Albeni meditation crystal.
 BEATA / Very impressive.
 BEATA / (continuing) And now, of course, I must repay you in kind.
 RAMSEY / ... Five months in a rescue pod no bigger than this room is an eternity I hope none of you ever have to face. When we finally made it here, we all thought we'd died and gone to heaven. You've seen the women of the planet -- tall and strong and lovely.
 RAMSEY / (continuing) But once the newness wore off, we started to see how men on this planet were treated. No vote, no opinions... no respect.
 TASHA / None of which is any longer your concern, Mister Ramsey. Call the others in, please. It's time to leave.
 RAMSEY / Despite its problems, Lieutenant, we like it here on Angel One. (simply) We're not going anywhere.
 TROI / But Mistress Beata --
 RAMSEY / (overlapping) Mistress Beata be damned! Her wish is not my command. And neither is yours. You can't force us to go.
 DATA / Mister Ramsey is correct, Counselor. The Odin was not a starship, which means its crew is not bound by the Prime Directive. If he and the other survivors wish to stay here, there is absolutely nothing we can do.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Sickbay -- how are you Doing, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (into Com) We have more sick than we do beds.
 BEVERLY / I've been forced to confine over three hundred to their private quarters.
 GEORDI / We're going to be seriously undermanned if we're forced to engage the Romulans in battle.
 BEVERLY / The Romulans are your problem, Lieutenant. Trying to find an innoculant is mine. This virus mutates every twenty minutes. On the positive side, the virus is debilitating -- but so far we haven't had any fatalities.
 GEORDI / If this continues, there'll be no one left to run the ship.
 BEVERLY / If it continues, no one will be healthy enough to care.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise.
 GEORDI / (activating Com) Enterprise, go ahead.
 TASHA / Prepare to beam three back to our previous location, Geordi. After we regroup with Commander Riker, we'll return to the ship.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Suggest you make that on the double. We have a real medical emergency brewing up here. A third of the crew is down. And the latest report from the Neutral Zone outpost is that more Romulan battlecrusiers are entering the area.
 TASHA / I'll inform the commander. (then, to Ramsey) One thing before we go. You said you were expecting us. Why?
 RAMSEY / I'm sorry. I can't tell you.
 TROI / We wish you well, Mister Ramsey.
 TASHA / (into Com) Energize!
 RAMSEY / They are gone.
 BEATA / It is such a refreshing change to be with a man who knows what he wants.
 RIKER / You mean without a woman having to tell him?
 BEATA / Exactly! I knew you were bright enough to understand. Women, by our very nature, want only what is best for their men.
 RIKER / Men are not objects to be possessed, Mistress Beata.
 BEATA / (humoring him) Of course they're not. It was merely a figure of speech.
 BEATA / Enter.
 BEATA / Why do you bother me?
 TRENT / Forgive the disturbance, Elected One...
 BEATA / (to Riker) I expect so little from this sorry excuse for a man. Perhaps even that much is too much...
 BEATA / (continuing) What is so important you find it necessary to intrude on my privacy?
 TRENT / They have returned, Mistress. But without Ramsey or the others.
 BEATA / Your advanced technology has proven inadequate?
 RIKER / What happened, Troi?
 TROI / Mister Ramsey and the other survivors refuse to leave.
 BEATA / But you promised!
 RIKER / (considers, and:) I'm sorry. There's nothing else we can do.
 BEATA / I am sorry as well.
 BEATA / (continuing) Since you refuse to take them with you, I am left with no choice... but to sentence them all to death.
 PICARD / Enter.
 BEVERLY / It looks horrible, tastes worse -- but it's absolutely guaranteed to make you feel better.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Knew you'd like it. (smells) New cologne?
 PICARD / (coughs, groans) Same... you gave me last birthday.
 BEVERLY / Uh-uh, different. Like something I smelled earlier. Something... I don't know... like a flower I remember. Something Klingon, I think.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf and I... detected a similar scent when we bumped into... your son at the Holodeck.
 BEVERLY / (lightbulb!) It's that smell! That must be how the virus travels! (working it out:) An airborne microbe whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation... (bingo!) ... And once inside the body, becomes this damned virus! (quickly) I have a great deal of work to do.
 PICARD / You are excused, Doctor.
 RIKER / What's the latest on the Enterprise's medical situation?
 DATA / Doctor Crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run unchecked through the entire ship's contingent. Attempts to develop an innoculant have so far ended in failure. Lieutenant La Forge still has the Conn pending your return.
 RIKER / What about the Romulans in the Neutral Zone?
 DATA / The border outpost reports a contingent of seven Romulan battlecruisers within sensor range. The USS Berlin has answered their distress call, and is standing by. However, should hostilities erupt, the outpost and the starship will be outgunned. It is felt that the Enterprise's presence in the area will be a vital show of force.
 TASHA / Some show of force. The Enterprise may be able to fly on autopilot. But with that virus knocking down our crew, we're going to be in sorry shape if things turn ugly.
 RIKER / The Romulans won't know our strength, Lieutenant. (glancing around) It's time for us to leave this place.
 TROI / It feels terribly wrong to leave while Beata is determined to execute those people.
 RIKER / She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch have been fugitives for years. I suspect he's pretty good at evading capture. As cold as it sounds we're going to have to treat this mission as if it never happened. Everything will remain exactly as it was before we arrived.
 TROI / (low, to team) Something is wrong.
 BEATA / Your presence on Angel One no longer amuses me.
 RIKER / Amusement was never our intention, Mistress.
 BEATA / Before you go back to your ship, there is something I wish you to see.
 RAMSEY / (to Troi) We were no harm to anyone. Why did you tell them where to find us?
 BEATA / Don't blame them, Ramsey. You brought this upon yourself. You... and the traitor.
 BEATA / (continuing) One doesn't need the technology of the Enterprise to follow Mistress Ariel sneaking off to warn her husband. (to Guard) Let her stand with him now...
 BEATA / (continuing) ... For tomorrow they will die together.
 BEVERLY / You're out of commission, Geordi. Report to your quarters.
 GEORDI / (in horrible pain) Can't leave my post... until I'm relieved.
 BEVERLY / I've been aboard the Enterprise long enough to know she's designed to run herself.
 GEORDI / But the innoculant --
 BEVERLY / I can do my research on the computers here.
 GEORDI / Then I can convalesce here.
 RIKER / You claim to be an advanced society, yet you resort to tyranny and executions in order to suppress those who don't share your views.
 BEATA / I don't expect you to understand.
 RIKER / Why? Because I'm only a man?
 BEATA / You'll accomplish nothing with that attitude.
 RIKER / Mistress Beata, if you could avoid executing Ramsey and his followers, would you do so?
 BEATA / Is that not the way of an advanced society?
 RIKER / Then let us talk to men from the Odin one last time. Let me try to convince them to leave with us.
 BEATA / But what of the others? Their minds have been poisoned. Will you also include those from this planet who unwisely chose to follow Ramsey and his group?
 RIKER / Yes. All of them.
 TROI / Mistress Beata is giving you a second chance. We're prepared to take your entire group with us.
 RAMSEY / That's very kind of you, sir, but we're not going.
 TASHA / Haven't you been paying attention, Ramsey? You're scheduled to be executed tomorrow.
 RAMSEY / We don't want to die. We don't want to leave, either. I'm not Academy educated, but I've studied a little history. The ancient Christians faced their lions, the natives of the African continent faced their suppressors. (MORE)
 RAMSEY (Cont'd) / Even the women of the twentieth century chose to settle for nothing but full equality.
 RIKER / There's no time to debate the issues, Ramsey. We're taking you with us whether you choose to go or not.
 DATA / Excuse me, Commander, but removing any of these people against their will would be a violation of several Starfleet regulations, not the least of which would be the Prime Directive.
 RIKER / (sharply) I realize that, Data. (softly) But I'd rather be facing a court martial than trying to live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths. (into Com) Commander Riker to Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / (into Com) This is the Enterprise.
 TASHA / Things must be worse up there than we thought.
 RIKER / Doctor, where is Lieutenant La Forge?
 BEVERLY / He's right here, Will, but he's in no shape to be here.
 RIKER / We're on our way, Doctor. There'll be fourteen to beam up. Two groups, five each. I'll be in the last group of four.
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid I can't allow that, Will. The virus is totally out of control. Until I know exactly what I'm dealing with, I can't let anyone new be exposed.
 RIKER / There are people facing certain death down here, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / They could well be facing the same thing up here, Will. I have no idea what effect living on Angel One might have on a person's immune system. I'm sorry.
 RIKER / Understood. (considers, then:) Doctor -- would this virus have any effect on Data?
 BEVERLY / None that I can imagine.
 RIKER / You're going back alone, Data. We have no idea what the Romulans plan to do to that outpost. You're going to have to get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.
 RIKER / (continuing) That's a direct order, Mister Data.
 DATA / Neutral Zone before it is too late. Understood, Commander.
 DATA / (into Com) This is Data, standing by to beam up.
 TROI / And what of them?
 RIKER / I don't know, Deanna.
 TRENT / Mistress Beata invites you to witness this morning's reaffirmation of Angel One's moral imperative.
 TASHA / Is that supposed to be the fancy name for murder on this planet?
 RIKER / Send Mistress Beata our regrets.
 TRENT / The Elected One will not look fondly upon --
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Enterprise to Commander Riker.
 TROI / (surprised) They are still here?
 RIKER / (into Com, angry:) This is Commander Riker.
 RIKER / I gave you a direct order to head for the Neutral Zone immediately. Explain the delay.
 DATA / To be precise, Commander, you ordered me to reach the Neutral Zone "before it is too late." I have computed the length of time the border outpost and USS Berlin can safely withstand a Romulan attack... deducted our time to destination at maximum warp speed. That leaves Doctor Crusher with forty-eight more minutes to complete her research and develop an innoculant to the virus.
 TASHA / (energized) Which means there's still time for us to do something.
 RIKER / Forty-eight minutes... I think we're down to splitting hairs.
 DATA / Splitting hairs is a figure of speech I recognize, Commander. Speaking for those whose hair is soon to be split, forty-eight minutes may make a great deal of difference. (refers to console) Excuse me -- forty-seven minutes.
 RIKER / (considering:) Perhaps, Data, just perhaps. (then) Thanks for following my orders so precisely, Data. Riker out.
 RIKER / (continuing) On second thought, Trent, we would be honored to watch your moral imperative in action.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Sickbay to bridge.
 DATA / Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Bingo, Data.
 DATA / Bingo? I fail to see the relevance, Doctor. Is that not a reference to an ancient Earth game?
 BEVERLY / It's also a reference to success, Data. I've got the innoculant.
 DATA / Excellent, Doctor. And we still have a margin of seventeen minutes. I will inform the away team immediately. (changes channel) Enterprise to Commander Riker.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / We are ready to have you beamed up, Commander.
 RIKER / Data, I want you to lock the transporter on the holding area where they're keeping Ramsey and the others. If we don't hear from Beata in the next ten minutes, you are to begin the beam up sequence, five at a time. The away team will beam up last.
 DATA / Understood, Commander. Enterprise out.
 TRENT / The Elected One wishes to see you.
 BEVERLY / Welcome home.
 RIKER / It's good to be back. Is everyone recovering?
 BEVERLY / Slowly... but yes.
 PICARD / Enter.
 TROI / How are you feeling, sir?
 PICARD / On the mend, thank you. Tell me about Angel One.
 RIKER / Set coordinates for the Neutral Zone, Mister Data. We have a call to pay on the Romulans.
 DATA / Coordinates set, Commander. On your mark --
 RIKER / As Captain Picard would say -- make it so, Mister Data.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41365.9. The Enterprise has been ordered to Starbase 74, in orbit around Tarsas III.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... where a routine maintenance check of all systems will be made, and certain upgrades completed, including the Holodeck, with which we have had problems. I anticipate a glowing report. This ship has performed magnificently -- beyond anyone's expectations.
 GEORDI / Coming into position.
 RIKER / Stand by to dock.
 DATA / Ready to dock.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Engage mooring beams and lock off.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / Docking complete.
 PICARD / Thank you, Number One. Well done, and well done all.
 PICARD / Granted -- and welcome.
 PICARD / (continuing) This is Commander Riker.
 RIKER / We were unexpectedly delayed at Omicron Pascal.
 PICARD / No. We are very pleased with the operation of the Enterprise.
 RIKER / And are these gentlemen the Bynars?
 PICARD / (to the Bynars) Your reputation precedes you. I am pleased you will be improving our system.
 PICARD / You have forty-eight hours, because at forty-eight plus six we have an appointment at Pelleus Five which we must keep.
 PICARD / I'm sorry. Our mission can't be delayed. Can we postpone this work?
 PICARD / Commander Riker and I will stay aboard, and be available should you need us.
 RIKER / The Bynars are perfect for this. This is the first time I've come in contact with them.
 PICARD / As I understand it, over time they've become so interconnected with the master computer on their planet that their language and thought patterns have become as near to binary as possible for organic beings.
 RIKER / It will be interesting to see how they improve a computer as advanced as ours.
 PICARD / Well, I'm going to put my feet up, turn on my personal relaxation light and lose myself in the pages of some old novels.
 PICARD / Bridge. (then:) And you, Number One? You've earned a good rest. What are you going to do with it?
 RIKER / I've never been good at organizing my time off, but something will come up -- it always does.
 PICARD / I'll be in my Ready Room.
 RIKER / I thought there were only going to be two of you.
 RIKER / (picking up on their agitation) Is there a problem?
 RIKER / Then why are you all so excited?
 WESLEY / You act like you don't believe them.
 RIKER / I'm not sure. It's probably nothing.
 WESLEY / Maybe it's just how a different species behaves.
 RIKER / Maybe. I'm going to stroll the ship. You have the bridge. Keep an eye on them.
 WESLEY / Aye sir.
 TASHA / We've been challenged to a friendly game of Parrises Squares by some of the maintenance personnel -- want to join us on the starbase?
 RIKER / You've already got all the players you need.
 TASHA / We can switch off.
 RIKER / No... if you do that in Parrises Squares you lose the rhythm of the game.
 TASHA / I can't talk you into coming with us?
 RIKER / No. But win, all right? The pride of the Enterprise goes with you.
 WORF / Rest assured, Commander, we will be victorious, at whatever the cost.
 RIKER / (concerned) Worf -- it's just a game. You know, a little friendly competition -- work up a sweat, have some laughs, make new friends.
 WORF / (with a gleam in his eye) If winning is not important... then, Commander, why keep score?
 TASHA / I think he's pulling your leg. Believe it or not, Worf's developing a sense of humor.
 RIKER / Let's hope so for their sake.
 RIKER / Computer -- There's a power reduction in section L-Ninety Four. Explain.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / What do you think?
 RIKER (O.S.) / First tell me what it's supposed to be, then I'll give you an opinion.
 DATA / It is an attempt at pure creativity.
 GEORDI / What we're investigating is, "Can Data be creative?"
 DATA / This is my attempt... with guidance from Geordi.
 GEORDI / I suggested the Zylo eggs.
 RIKER / Is that what those are?
 RIKER / (continuing) Keep notes. This project might turn out to be of interest to future scholars.
 GEORDI / Really?
 RIKER / Think about it. A blind man teaching an android to paint? That's got to be worth a couple of pages in someone's book.
 BEVERLY is picking up notes and notebooks. She's / excited almost to the point of being frazzled. Riker ENTERS.
 RIKER / You look like you're packing up and leaving forever.
 BEVERLY / (surprised) Oh -- Commander Riker. No -- I'm just getting my notes together. It's so exciting. Doctor Terence Epstein is at this Starbase.
 RIKER / Is he someone I should know about?
 BEVERLY / He's the leading mind in cybernetics. He lectured at my medical school. Since the disaster at Micromius I've been working on a theory combining cybernetics and regeneration. It sounds impossible I know -- but I think I have an approach which could work. What an opportunity! To have a chance to discuss this with Doctor Esptein. Sorry, Will, I'd like to stay here and chat -- but I have to be going.
 RIKER / How's it going?
 RIKER / How much has it been changed? What exactly did you do?
 RIKER / (a beat) All right. What should I do?
 RIKER / Computer - I need a place to play some music - a little atmosphere.
 RIKER / Jazz.
 RIKER / (pauses) Circa 1958.
 RIKER / Kansas City. No, wait. New Orleans. Yeah. New Orleans -- the Low Note. 'Round midnight.
 RIKER / Very good.
 RIKER / (continuing) Very good indeed.
 RIKER / (continuing) Now, computer -- someone to play with. A combo. Say, drums upright bass...piano. And a 'bone for me.
 RIKER / (continuing) Now -- an audience...
 RIKER / (continuing) Whoa... too many. I was thinking of something a little more personal...intimate.
 RIKER / (continuing) Great job, boys.
 RIKER / (continuing) But, computer... blondes and jazz seldom go together.
 RIKER / (continuing; he turns to the Bynars.) Now that is truly exceptional... (then back to the computer) ...but... more sultry.
 RIKER / (to the Bynars) Gentlemen, if this is what you call "enhancement" you have a gift for understatement.
 RIKER / What's your name, and tell me you love jazz.
 MINUET / My name is Minuet. I love all jazz except Dixieland.
 RIKER / Why not Dixieland?
 MINUET / Because you can't dance to it.
 RIKER / My girl.
 RIKER / (slyly) What's a knockout like you doing in a computer-generated joint like this?
 MINUET / Waiting for you.
 RIKER / Waiting for me?!! You can't be serious?
 MINUET / Oh yes, Will -- I've never been more serious in my life.
 WESLEY / Do you mind if I ask you a question about the Bynars?
 WESLEY / What is that high-speed sound you make?
 WESLEY / How can humanoids process information at that speed?
 WESLEY / How did you happen to develop this ability?
 WESLEY / To have a society so interdependent on computers has tremendous advantages.
 PICARD / Everything under control, Ensign Crusher?
 WESLEY / Fine, Captain. I am just trying to learn something about the Bynars.
 PICARD / Where's Commander Riker?
 WESLEY / Holodeck Four. Shall I call him for you, sir?
 PICARD / No, I'll wander down and see what's he doing to occupy himself. Keep me apprised.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / What makes you say that?
 RIKER / Maybe it's my music.
 RIKER / It's all too real.
 RIKER / Thanks for letting me sit in.
 RIKER / I am going to have to leave you for a while and see to my duties.
 MINUET / Your work is very important to you.
 RIKER / It is me -- it's what I am.
 MINUET / Can we dance once before you leave?
 RIKER / Sure, why not.
 RIKER / How did you learn to dance so well?
 MINUET / From following you.
 MINUET / I can anticipate your lead. Tell me more about your work -- what is it about it that consumes and enthralls you?
 RIKER / What an interesting choice of words. That's exactly what it does.
 MINUET / You are very fortunate.
 RIKER / I know that.
 MINUET / At this point in your life to be exactly where you want to be... And it's wonderful that you realize it.
 RIKER / I'd be a fool not to know how lucky I am to be on this ship serving with this group of people. It's a dream come true.
 RIKER / (continuing) Just like this.
 MINUET / A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what I am?
 RIKER / I know you are a computer-generated image... but your smell, the way you feel, your touch, even the way you talk and think is so real.
 MINUET / Thank you.
 RIKER / How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you?
 MINUET / As real as you need me to be.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Astounding.
 RIKER / Captain!
 PICARD / Sorry, Number One -- I didn't mean to interrupt.
 RIKER / It's all right, come in.
 PICARD / You picked a wonderful locale. Something I might have chosen myself.
 MINUET / Aren't you going to introduce me?
 RIKER / Excuse me. Yes, yes, of course I am. Captain Picard, this is Minuet... Minuet, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
 MINUET / Enchante. Comme c'est merveilleux de vous voir ici.
 PICARD / Incroyable! Vous etes Parisienne?
 MINUET / Au fonde c'est vrai, nous sommes tous Parisienne.
 PICARD / (laughs) Oui, au fonde nous sommes tous Parisienne. The spirit of that city can always restore my soul.
 MINUET / I have been hoping to meet you.
 PICARD / (with a look to Riker) Oh. (lightly) Have I been a topic of conversation?
 MINUET / Indirectly.
 MINUET / (continuing) Join us, Jean-Luc.
 MINUET / (continuing) A glass of wine?
 PICARD / Thank you.
 MINUET / Will was saying how much he enjoys this assignment. It's a credit to you. For a ship and crew to function well it always starts with the captain. You set the tone.
 PICARD / (to Minuet, graciously) At the moment, it's you who are setting the tone. (then, to Riker) The sophistication of this programming is remarkable.
 MINUET / In what way?
 PICARD / The Holodeck has been able to give us woodlands and ski slopes and figures that fight and fictional characters with which we can interact -- but you are quite different. You adapt. You spoke French to me.
 MINUET / It's very simple. When I heard your name, I merely accessed the foreign language bank.
 PICARD / Impressive.
 MINUET / Oui, mon choux.
 GEORDI / Now what are you doing?
 DATA / I am awaiting inspiration.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Commander Data.
 DATA / This is Commander Data, go ahead.
 WESLEY / I'm getting an indication of possible trouble in Main Engineering.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Can you be more specific?
 WESLEY / Not very much. I'm reading a problem with the magnetic field which contains the antimatter. Could you come up here?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We'll go to Engineering since that's where the trouble is. Wes, don't disturb the captain or Commander Riker until we check this out.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / bridge, this is Main Engineering.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / This is the bridge.
 GEORDI / Are you running any test programs?
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / No.
 GEORDI / Are the Bynars?
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Not to my knowledge. Is something wrong?
 GEORDI / I don't know. There's nobody on duty here, and we're getting a strange reading from the magnetic containment field.
 DATA / The field is deteriorating. Contact the captain immediately. I am initiating Red Alert.
 GEORDI / I can't maintain the integrity of the containment field.
 DATA / If the antimatter is released the ship will be destroyed.
 GEORDI / Nothing I do has any effect. I'm losing it. I have rechecked every circuit. This is not a misread by the computer.
 DATA / Computer -- situation analysis.
 DATA / Bridge -- Engineering.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Yes. This is the bridge.
 DATA / Alert starbase. Inform them we are abandoning the ship. Tell them why. Initiate the automated sequence for departure, lay in a course and speed to put maximum distance between the Enterprise and any inhabited planet.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Shouldn't we wait for the captain's approval?
 DATA / There is no time. Based on all the information presently available the decision is correct. (touches the com panel) This is Lieutenant Commander Data speaking for the captain -- abandon ship -- this is not a drill.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / I say again. All personnel abandon ship. Abandon ship -- this is not a drill -- this is not a drill.
 BEVERLY / When I reviewed your fifth paper on molecular biology, I knew I was on the right track. You defined the problem as conductivity -- and that's exactly what...
 BEVERLY / Oh, no! Something's happened to the Enterprise. That's my ship!
 WORF / What's going on?
 BEVERLY / The Enterprise is being evacuated.
 WORF / Why?
 BEVERLY / Some problem in Engineering.
 TASHA / Get the security team together.
 WORF / Aye, Lieutenant.
 DATA (V.O.) / Ship's log. Supplemental. This is Lieutenant Commander Data. I have put the ship on automated departure and ordered the complete evacuation of the Enterprise. Everyone remaining is leaving on foot or beaming off.
 DATA / Computer, where are the captain and Commander Riker?
 DATA / Curious. The captain is usually the last to leave.
 GEORDI / Let's go! We only have forty-one seconds.
 GEORDI / I think we're the last.
 DATA / I hope we are the last.
 WORF / Did you see the captain and Commander Riker?
 DATA / No. Are they not here on the Starbase?
 TASHA / No.
 GEORDI / Are you saying they are still on the Enterprise?
 WORF / Yes. Sir, where's your Transporter Room?
 DATA / We have to beam back and get them.
 GEORDI / How is that possible?
 TASHA / That changes nothing. The captain and Commander Riker must be in trouble, or they'd be here.
 MINUET / ... and the boy never found out?
 RIKER / Oh, yes, but not until later. (lightly) When he finally walked in with his younger sister.
 MINUET / And I'll bet both of them were all smiles.
 RIKER / Yes. And we knew right then both of them had found out.
 MINUET / You handled it in a very thoughtful way. You are very good with people. (to Picard) Don't you agree, Jean-Luc?
 PICARD / She's very different from any images we've experienced on the Holodeck, isn't she? More -- you might say -- intuitive.
 RIKER / It's as though she was plugged into my subconscious and can anticipate what I want her to say even before I'm aware of it myself.
 PICARD / I suppose it's an understandable progression. Computers make decisions based on inputs and we humans give off many subtle signs which communicate our emotions.
 RIKER / It's uncanny. I could develop feelings for Minuet. A desire exactly as I would for any woman.
 PICARD / Doesn't love always begin that way? With the illusion being more real than the woman?
 MINUET / Oh, Jean-Luc, spoken like a true Frenchman.
 PICARD / I think I'll be leaving.
 MINUET / Oh, don't go.
 PICARD / Two's company.
 MINUET / We have time -- there's no rush. I'd like it very much if you would stay.
 RIKER / Yes, stay, Captain.
 PICARD / This is your diversion, Number One. Not mine.
 MINUET / Wait -- we haven't danced.
 PICARD / I don't dance.
 MINUET / Then some more wine.
 PICARD / Thank you, no.
 MINUET / Wait -- please. Please don't go -- you can't. Not yet.
 PICARD / What?
 RIKER / Why -- Minuet -- what's the matter? Why can't he leave?
 PICARD / (to computer) Exit.
 PICARD / (touches a panel) bridge, this is the captain. Situation report.
 RIKER / Riker to bridge.
 PICARD / (tense) Computer! Explain Red Alert.
 PICARD / Why wasn't I notified?
 PICARD / Present condition.
 PICARD / (beat, thinks) Locate Lieutenant Commander Data.
 PICARD / Explain.
 PICARD / Evacuated!? Was the condition that critical?
 RIKER / Are we still docked on the starbase?
 PICARD / Position report.
 PICARD / Destination?
 RIKER / The Bynars!
 PICARD / Am I to understand that the Bynars have stolen the Enterprise?
 PICARD / (a beat, strong) It's the Bynars -- and you're part of this.
 MINUET / (without hesitation) Yes.
 RIKER / They made you the lure to keep me here! They programmed you while I was relaxing.
 MINUET / Yes. When they saw your interest in me, they thought I could distract you and keep you here.
 PICARD / That explains, Riker... What about me?
 MINUET / Your being here was just a fortunate happenstance.
 RIKER / Why do they want me?
 PICARD / What do they want with the Enterprise? What's their purpose?
 MINUET / I am not programmed to give you that information.
 PICARD / Come on, Number One. We've got to regain control of our ship!
 GEORDI / What do we do?
 DATA / Which is the nearest Starfleet vessel?
 DATA / I know the Trieste. Too small, too slow.
 DATA / Where are the Bynars?
 DATA / Then they are obviously still aboard. Another Starfleet vessel must be sent to intercept the Enterprise at Bynaus. They might be taking the ship to their home planet.
 DATA / It is the best place for us to start.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We now know "who" has commandeered the Enterprise... the Bynars. We can't communicate with the bridge. Commander Riker and I will now try to regain control of our ship.
 PICARD / This way.
 RIKER / But that's toward Engineering.
 PICARD / That's our first stop, to verify the containment, and initiate auto-destruct.
 RIKER / Initiate auto-destruct?
 PICARD / The ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size and intent. We're here alone. We must assume the worst.
 PICARD / If we don't regain control, no one else will have it either. This is the only decision involving the operation of this ship which requires you and I to agree totally.
 RIKER / It's the allotted time that concerns me.
 PICARD / About that, there is no option.
 RIKER / I know. It's a five minute countdown.
 PICARD / It's sufficient to get to the bridge... once there, either we'll get control of the ship and shut off the auto-destruct, or we won't. The important thing is that this ship does not fall into hostile hands.
 RIKER / Then let's set it and get going.
 PICARD / Set auto-destruct sequence.
 RIKER / ... Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence -- now!
 PICARD / Let's go. The only place we can stop the count is from the bridge.
 RIKER (O.S.) / What do you make of this?
 PICARD / An enormous amount of data is being received and stored in the main computer.
 RIKER / Just stored. Why?
 PICARD / It's another piece to this puzzle.
 PICARD / They've locked it off.
 PICARD / (continuing) We've got to find another way to get in.
 RIKER / One of us could beam onto the bridge.
 PICARD / It takes several seconds to materialize. You wouldn't stand a chance.
 RIKER / I could beam into the turbolift, force the doors, and take them by surprise.
 PICARD / No. We'll beam in simultaneously in two different areas of the bridge.
 RIKER / Only four minutes left.
 GEORDI / Still no response from the Enterprise.
 WORF / They would answer if they could. Someone else has control of the ship.
 DATA / Do you think I am responsible?
 GEORDI / Why? How could you have known?
 DATA / My station is on the bridge.
 GEORDI / You can't be on the bridge every minute.
 DATA / You are wrong, Geordi, I can. I do not need rest or diversion -- I should not have been painting. I was negligent.
 TASHA / That's a pointless discussion. You could have been on the bridge and it still might have happened.
 TASHA / (continuing; to Quinteros) You have three ships in here. We need one of them now.
 RIKER / I'll set a ten-second delay.
 PICARD / Right. Coordinates for Main Bridge -- port forward for me and aft for you.
 RIKER / (a beat) You're on Pad Two.
 RIKER / (continuing) Done. (a beat) Ten second delay... NOW.
 PICARD / Why did you steal my ship?
 PICARD / Cancel auto-destruct.
 RIKER / Affirmative.
 RIKER / We're in orbit around Bynaus. (indicating the Bynars) How are they?
 PICARD / They appear dead.
 PICARD / (continuing) Let's see if we can get some answers from Bynaus.
 RIKER / Their main computer is off. Sensors reveal all of the equipment on the planet is inert. They can neither receive nor send any messages.
 PICARD / What about all the people in that world who are totally dependant on their computer? Are they still functioning?
 RIKER / No. They are probably just like these Bynars here. Dying.
 RIKER / So, what's this all about? Why did they steal the ship and bring it here? What was their purpose?
 PICARD / They went to a lot of trouble to clear computer space. See what they've stored.
 RIKER / Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space in the computer has been filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world to our computer.
 RIKER / (continuing) I can't get in.
 RIKER / (continuing; reading the Screen) I need a code -- a password -- to access the file.
 PICARD / They were desperate to steal this ship, bring it here to store all this information. Why?
 RIKER / I don't know. I wish they had left a note.
 PICARD / Perhaps they did.
 RIKER / Minuet.
 PICARD / Maybe.
 RIKER / Tell me what this is all about.
 MINUET / A star in the Bynar system went super nova and they miscalculated. The electromagnetic pulse from the explosion was going to knock out their main computer.
 PICARD / Their only chance was to transfer all the stored information and shut down until after it passed. Then, reactivate their system and transfer the information back to this main computer.
 RIKER / And the Enterprise has the only mobile computer large enough to handle all that information.
 PICARD / So what went wrong?
 MINUET / The star went super nova before it was expected and you were late arriving at Starbase 74.
 PICARD / But why steal the ship? Why didn't they say something? Why didn't they just ask for help?
 MINUET / (shrugs) I don't know. I don't have those answers.
 PICARD / Is there anything we can do?
 MINUET / Yes. Return the data stored in the Enterprise's computer back to the one on Bynaus.
 RIKER / How do we do that?
 MINUET / (puzzled) Don't you know?
 RIKER / Yes. If we had the file name. But we don't. Do you?
 MINUET / I don't know what you're talking about. No.
 PICARD / They wouldn't intentionally hide it or make it difficult for us to find. It's got to be right in front of us.
 RIKER / (to Picard) We should call Starbase 74, and see if anyone can decipher this.
 MINUET / (emotionally) Hurry. They're dying. (to Picard) They meant you no harm. It was their world they were trying to save. (to Riker) Help them, Will -- please help them.
 PICARD / Starbase 74 -- this is the Enterprise.
 PICARD / We'll get into that later. Right now I must speak with Lieutenant Commander Data.
 DATA / I am here, sir.
 PICARD / Data, the Bynars have stored an enormous amount of information in the computer. We can't access it, and we must.
 DATA / The access would be available by code or password.
 PICARD / I know, but what could it be?
 DATA / File names can be anything.
 PICARD / They want us to find it. They would have kept it simple.
 DATA / Then a name -- or a place. It could be personal. In this case in binary language which is ones and zeros in groups of eight or sixteen characters.
 PICARD / Could it be that simple? (to Riker) Try it.
 RIKER / That's the file. It'll work now.
 PICARD / Well done, Will. Now access the file and start the transfer.
 RIKER / So much for that idea.
 PICARD / Let me get on the other position. The Bynars always work in pairs, perhaps that is also required.
 PICARD / It appears to be successful. The system has started up -- a resident diagnostic program is running. Their system is incredible.
 PICARD / Why didn't you just ask for our help?
 RIKER / But there was a very good chance we would have said "yes."
 PICARD / So you stole it.
 RIKER / Their reason is part of their binary thinking -- for them there are only two choices -- one or zero -- yes or no.
 PICARD / No one's been hurt. They accomplished their objective. They have their world back in order, and we have our ship.
 PICARD / (continuing) It's been some time since I had the Conn.
 PICARD / (continuing) But, not to worry, Number One you're in good hands. Starbase 74 -- at warp two.
 PICARD / (continuing) Engage.
 PICARD / (continuing) Under complete control.
 PICARD / We are all right, everything is fine. Now -- I want a complete check of all systems and divisions.
 TASHA / What about the Bynars?
 PICARD / Turn them over to Quinteros. (to the Bynars) There will be a hearing.
 RIKER / That being the case -- permission to leave the bridge.
 PICARD / Permission granted.
 RIKER / What's a knockout like you doin' in a computer-generated joint like this?
 RIKER / You're not Minuet.
 RIKER / She's gone. I tried variations of the program, others appeared, but not Minuet.
 PICARD / Maybe that too, was part of the Bynar's program. Some relationships just can't work.
 RIKER / (he can agree intellectually, but emotionally it's not easy) Yes... probably true... but, she will be difficult to forget.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41463.9. We are mapping the Pleiades Cluster which has many young planets and we've been asked by the Federation to visit a group terraforming Velara III, which we would very much like to see. Communications have been erratic and there is some concern about their welfare.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, TROI, TASHA, GEORDI and WORF -- / at their respective stations -- all study Velara III on the Main Viewer. As Velara III SETTLES INTO PLACE on the Main Viewer:
 GEORDI / Entering standard orbit -- now.
 PICARD / It takes special people to live in such desolation.
 TROI / Visionaries, who don't see this planet as it is, but as it will be.
 RIKER / I've always wanted to see terraforming in operation.
 PICARD / Hailing frequency, Lieutenant Yar.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / Velara III base, this is Captain Picard of the starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / (continuing) Lieutenant Yar... ?
 TASHA / No equipment malfunction on either end, sir. They are receiving.
 PICARD / Velara III, this is the Enterprise. Come in please.
 GEORDI / (after a beat) Maybe nobody's home.
 DATA / We are sensing life-forms, sir.
 PICARD / (concerned) Velara III, do you copy?
 PICARD / Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were getting along.
 TROI / (quietly) We alarm him for some reason.
 PICARD / (a pause) Your staff is all well, I presume, Director?
 PICARD / Is there anything we can do to help?... You and your staff are welcome aboard for a change of scene and some rest. We have some Holodecks you might enjoy.
 TROI / His fear is escalating.
 TROI / I sense deliberate concealment, sir.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Of what?
 TROI / I don't know, but it's intense.
 PICARD / We've heard so much about your remarkable achievements in terraforming, that my staff would very much appreciate looking around.
 PICARD / We do not require any special attention.
 TROI / He's concealing something and it's more than just being too busy. Your announcement about coming down has pushed him almost to the point of panic.
 PICARD / Whether he wants us or not... (touching his com) Director Mandl, unless you are absolutely refusing permission for us to land on your station, please prepare to receive my away team.
 PICARD / Stay on your toes, Number One. Counselor, perhaps you should go along. A man this tense is unpredictable.
 LUISA / Welcome to Velara III. Remember it as it is now, because in a couple of decades you won't recognize the place. (steps foward) Luisa Kim. Gardener of Edens.
 RIKER / Commander William Riker, USS Enterprise. This is Lieutenant Commander Data, Counselor Troi, Lieutenant Yar and Lieutenant La Forge.
 LUISA / This is Bjorn Bensen, Chief Engineer, and Arthur Malencon, our Hydraulics Specialist,
 TASHA / And third in command of the Enterprise.
 BENSEN / Where were you manufactured -- are there others like you?
 DATA / Both matters are subjects of protracted discussion.
 BENSEN / Remarkable.
 LUISA / We don't get visitors. It's exciting to have you here.
 RIKER / We weren't sure how we would be received. Director Mandl seemed less than enthusiastic about our interest.
 LUISA / (warmly) I should apologize for him. We are at a critical phase. Usually he's quite charming.
 RIKER / We'll stay out of your way, it's just that we've never seen a terraforming station, and couldn't resist the opportunity.
 LUISA / How much do you know about the process?
 DATA / The theories -- the reports -- but nothing firsthand.
 LUISA / Oh, wonderful. Then let me show you around.
 TROI / (sotto voce) The other two are as veiled and secretive as Mandl, but she is not.
 LUISA / What we're doing is so exciting, so -- inspiring. We take a lifeless planet and little by little transform it into an M-class environment, capable of supporting life. Terraforming makes you feel a little godlike. (beat) Is that a terribly arrogant thing to say?
 DATA / Not at all. It is accurate.
 LUISA / The first phase is selecting the planet. That's very important. It must have the right mass and gravity, the correct rate of rotation, and a balanced day and night. The planet must also be without life or having the prospect of life delveloping naturally. The Federation makes that decision. Then... (she pauses a beat for emphasis) ... we take over.
 LUISA / (continuing) What you see here -- this station -- is Phase Two. Phase Three involves the water. Usually we create basins, using hydraulic landscaping, but the water on this planet is subsurface, and extremely high in salt content. We are just about to begin pumping and filtering that water, removing the salt, oxygenating and replacing. Next we introduce micro-organisms, and when the process is complete...
 LUISA / (continuing) ... eventually, we'll have a lush, arable, biosphere.
 RIKER / You make it sound poetic.
 LUISA / (brightly) I think it's the best occupation in the universe.
 DATA / The efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is elegant.
 GEORDI / Could it be the increased conductivity caused by the high saline content?
 BENSEN / Arthur.
 BENSEN / (continuing; curtly) We checked that out. That wasn't it.
 TROI / What you are doing here is miraculous.
 GEORDI / That must be the master subsurface pump. Impressive.
 DATA / (indicating another area on the computer screen) This is interesting. How the water table is a thin ribbon between the sandy surface layer and the rock below.
 GEORDI / And it follows the contour precisely.
 DATA / (nodding) Which would require extreme precision from the probe controls.
 RIKER / Incredible. It's planned month by month, decade by decade.
 TROI / (overlapping, alarmed) Commander... !
 RIKER / What is it, Deanna?
 TROI / (almost in pain) Malencon. He's in trouble.
 RIKER / Can you open it?
 TASHA / Let me try.
 TROI / We're too late.
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. What began as a routine visit to the Federation group terraforming Velara III has become a serious situation. Arthur Malencon, the hydraulics engineer, has been killed in an extraordinary accident.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Situation report, Number One.
 RIKER / (tense, trying to save a life) For safety reasons, we're shutting off all power to the hydraulics room before entering to recover the body. Then we'll beam him up to Sickbay, but from the look of his wounds, it's probably hopeless.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Keep me informed.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Data... ?
 DATA / Go ahead, Geordi.
 BENSEN / All set.
 GEORDI / We have your section powered down now. Bensen has locked the master servomotor drive system. It should be safe in there now.
 TASHA / I'm going in.
 DATA / I will go with you.
 TASHA / Transporter Room, this is Lieutenant Yar. Two to beam up to Sickbay.
 LUISA / I want to go. We should be with him. (to Mandl) Kurt, please come too.
 RIKER / Transporter Room, this is Commander Riker. Beam up four at my coordinates.
 DATA / (on com) I have seen malfunctions, but this is unprecedented. Almost as if the laser drill attempted to tear itself apart.
 BENSEN / (off Geordi's look) I can't explain it.
 DATA / (into com; reflecting) The laser blasts seemed to end when the yelling stopped.
 BENSEN'S COM VOICE / Maybe Arthur stopped it -- only not in time.
 DATA / Not possible.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Then what are you suggesting?
 DATA / Uncertain. (to Geordi) Geordi, would you please return power to the control console in this room. I want to reactivate the program.
 DATA / (into com) I am running the base drilling program.
 DATA / Servos OFF!
 BENSEN / They are off!
 GEORDI / Data, what's happening?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Too much to explain.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Enterprise. We have a problem!
 GEORDI / Open the door!
 DATA / STAY OUT! It is under control.
 GEORDI / Data --
 GEORDI / Are you injured?
 DATA / No.
 BENSEN / A year's work destroyed!
 DATA / I had no choice.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Away team report now! What is happening?
 DATA / (to Picard) ... We were attempting to trace the source of the malfunction when it attacked me.
 PICARD / None at all, Mr. Mandl. Until this is sorted out, I've provided temporary quarters for you and your crew. I suggest you use them.
 PICARD / An attack on one of my crew gives me the right, Mr. Mandl.
 PICARD / Your schedule is on hold, until I have a satisfactory explanation of what happened.
 PICARD / (crisp) Director Mandl. Wait. (to Tasha) Escort the director to his quarters.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Proceed with your report.
 DATA / It would appear that the laser drilling systems had been reprogrammed. (beat) As soon as its memory bank received power, it turned itself on and went after me. Fortunately, I was able to cope with it.
 GEORDI / (bank shot) Not by much, from what I saw.
 DATA / I believe it was programmed to destroy any person moving in that room.
 PICARD / Speculation or certainty?
 DATA / Certainty.
 GEORDI / It would have required the talents of a master programmer.
 DATA / But it was done.
 PICARD / Then the question is not who, because obviously it was one of the three remaining terraformers. The question is why. What are they hiding? What is so important it could make one of them, or all of them desperate enough to take a life?
 GEORDI / Shall I have them brought in, sir?
 PICARD / Not yet.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher?
 BEVERLY / Malencon never had a chance. The injuries were too severe, the damage too extensive.
 RIKER / The entire Velara III facility has been powered down, Captain.
 WORF / We've just completed a remote power feed to the life support systems.
 PICARD / Good. Data, I want you and Geordi to return for a more careful inspection.
 DATA / What are we to look for, sir?
 PICARD / Evidence of tampering, negligence, sabotage... whatever. I don't know, but the answer's there, on the planet.
 PICARD / (continuing) Tasha, I'd like you to provide Counselor Troi and me with complete personnel files on our three guests. Psych profiles, training, everything. I'm looking for motive, intent... the psychological capacity to commit one murder and attempt another.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (continuing, to Riker) It seems we've become policemen, Number One.
 DATA / Geordi. I need some visual assistance.
 GEORDI / What is it?
 GEORDI / (continuing) Inorganic. Nothing but basic elements. No carbon... sandy texture... But the flashes are almost... musical. I see color variations and rhythms which are like a melody.
 DATA / Speculation. Could it be alive?
 GEORDI / How could it be alive? It's inorganic.
 DATA / Whatever this is, it could be what they are covering up -- and the reason someone killed Malencon.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. On my order, Data's startling discovery of a possible indigenous and inorganic life-form -- something hitherto thought impossible...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... has been beamed aboard so that its true nature might be uncovered.
 WESLEY hovers over her shoulder, as do Picard, Data, / and Geordi.
 BEVERLY / (to Computer) Activate.
 BEVERLY / (continuing; to group) Let's be sure of what we have here. (to the scanner) Is the sample organic?
 DATA / Recheck analysis.
 BEVERLY / Magnify to screen.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Magnify -- factor rate five. (beat, and:) Hold surface. Rate ten. (beat, and:) Hold.
 PICARD (O.S.) / What are we looking at?
 WESLEY (O.S.) / It's really beautiful. Whatever it is...
 PICARD / (rhetorically) What's causing that hum?
 BEVERLY / Computer, what is the magnification?
 BEVERLY / Analysis. The pattern of the flashes.
 BEVERLY / What is the source of the flashes?
 BEVERLY / Disregard incongruity and theorize as to source?
 PICARD / Understandable, given this particular life-form's novel nature.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher is still making her determination. (beat) I presume you know the Prime Directive, Mr. Mandl.
 PICARD / I don't know. But I intend to find out. (level beat) You're a man obsessed with what he does. Who knows what an obsessed man would do to keep going? Kill, perhaps?
 PICARD / What do you think?
 RIKER / You hit him pretty hard, Captain.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / It was useful. (to Picard) I felt two levels. He knew about the life-form. The idea of murder seemed to shock him. I couldn't tell if it was the whole idea, or just being accused of it.
 PICARD / What about his file, Lieutenant Yar? Could he have accomplished the reprogramming that Data says took place?
 TASHA / Mandl holds advanced degrees in Computer Science as well as Artificial Intelligence. It's possible.
 PICARD / What about the others? Including the victim.
 TASHA / Only the victim had the required expertise. But Malencon did work where the... whatever-it-is... was found. Trying to suppress that knowledge would be motive for murder... if Mandl were obsessed enough.
 TROI / Terraformers are often obsessive. It goes with the career profile.
 RIKER / How do you read the designer?
 TROI / Possessed of a highly abstracted reality. Lovely visions, little data. (smile) You might do better than I.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Luisa... are you all right?
 LUISA / (flatly) It isn't locked.
 RIKER / Mind a visitor?
 LUISA / Is it true... did you really find a life-form?
 RIKER / It's still being debated in some quarters. But I think so, yes.
 LUISA / What's it like?
 RIKER / We have nothing to compare it to, but it's microscopic... seems colonial... simple... and inorganic. (gentle) That's why the recon scouts missed it. This one wasn't your mistake.
 LUISA / Everything I've worked for is falling apart.
 RIKER / It's very beautiful. I'll arrange for you to see it, if you like.
 LUISA / Perhaps later.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Captain, this is Doctor Crusher. I think you'd better come to the Medical Lab.
 PICARD / What is it?
 BEVERLY / Geordi observed movement.
 GEORDI / It's not exactly movement, it's a shift in the energy pattern.
 DATA / Without external influence.
 WESLEY / Couldn't coordinated static charges promote the shift?
 DATA / Yes, if any were present in the jar, but none is.
 GEORDI / It's changing.
 PICARD / I can't see any difference.
 GEORDI / The infrared range is increasing.
 DATA / It is projecting an energy field!
 GEORDI / And it's increasing!
 DATA / Only life can replicate itself, Doctor. Inorganic or not, it is alive.
 BEVERLY / Activate quarantine field.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Quarantine field full!
 BEVERLY / (continuing; more imperative) Full shield backup!
 PICARD / Translation? From whom?
 BEVERLY / Evacuating lab.
 WESLEY / What's going on with the translator circuit?
 PICARD / (into communicator) bridge, this is the captain. Request emergency power to increase lab quarantine seal...
 RIKER / Do it, Mister Worf. (into com) What's the nature of the problem, Captain? We've lost visual.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We have confirmed Data's discovery is life, but more than that - it is intelligent.
 RIKER / How do you know?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (beat, and:) It has just taken possession of the Medical Lab.
 PICARD / Because it's trying to communicate with us!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are attempting to deal with the aggressive inorganic life-form which Data brought up from the planet. It has taken over the Medical Lab, and is apparently attempting to communicate with us.
 WORF / It generates enough energy to interfere with surrounding systems.
 PICARD / Mr. La Forge -- can we see into the lab yet?
 GEORDI / Negative, Captain. But, reducing backup to the quarantine seal might help.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Doctor?
 BEVERLY / I wouldn't.
 PICARD / Continue backup to shield, Lieutenant.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Director Mandl and the others are in the Observation Lounge as you requested.
 PICARD / Counselor, I'll need you. (to Riker) You have the bridge, Number One.
 PICARD / (to Mandl) What do you know of this life-form?
 PICARD / You knew of its existence.
 LUISA / (shocked) Is this true? (turning on Mandl) You knew there was life on Velara III?
 PICARD / But, you tried to hide that knowledge from us.
 PICARD / They are not only alive but they have intelligence.
 PICARD / They're trying to communicate with us.
 PICARD / I need information, now. When did you first see them? What were they doing? Why did you think they were alive?
 BENSEN / ... There were patterns, in the sand, appearing and disappearing --
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, we've regained a visual on the lab.
 PICARD / (into Com) Patch visual to Observation Lounge...
 WORF / I cannot understand the patterns.
 GEORDI / Neither can I.
 DATA / Please show me the spectral analysis. Magnification twelve K.
 WORF / But is it alive?!
 WORF / (to computer) I wasn't asking you.
 RIKER / This is Commander Riker, go ahead.
 RIKER / On my way. (on his EXIT) Data, you have the bridge. Inform the captain.
 RIKER / Status, Ensign?
 RIKER / (indicates panel) If that's reading right, there is no seal. (beat) Give me a lab interior image.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Magnify.
 RIKER / Captain, this is Riker.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We see it too, Number One.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (imperative) Get that seal back up!
 RIKER / (nods) Hold off. (into com) Impossible, Captain. We haven't got the power.
 DATA / The Universal Translator is coming on line.
 PICARD / Bags of mostly water?
 DATA / An accurate description, sir, of humans. You are, after all, over ninety per cent water, surrounded by a flexible container.
 PICARD / (after reacting) Do you understand me?
 PICARD / We didn't hear you. We come in peace.
 RIKER / It killed Malencon.
 TROI / (telepathically) We see and hear you now. We didn't know you were there. You are beautiful to us. All life is beautiful.
 PICARD / Can you hear me?
 PICARD / (continuing) Duty stations! Report!
 GEORDI / (checking console) Restabilizing, sir.
 DATA / Sir...
 PICARD / What is it, Data?
 DATA / That chaos in the lab, when we were studying it... must have been the energy surge of a reproductive cycle. (beat) It is now a colony of single cells which organize as a computer.
 PICARD / (nods) More is stronger.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We've stumbled on a life-form...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... biologically and psychologically difficult for us to fully understand. (beat) The only thing totally clear is that this microbrain, as we've come to call it, has declared war on us.
 RIKER / Their range of influence appears to be concentrated in the Medical Lab, Captain.
 TASHA / All non-essential personnel have been moved to the most distant areas of the ship, sir.
 PICARD / Data -- any analysis of those bolts of light they emit?
 DATA / That seems to be their method of reprogramming, Captain. Each bolt of light consists of negatively and positively charged ions. A series of program instructions, as it were. (disturbed) They seem to have a quicker rapport with our computers than we do.
 WORF / What do you expect? They are computers.
 PICARD / Have we disabled the Medical Lab computer console?
 RIKER / Aye, sir, as soon as Data determined the microbrain's method of operation.
 GEORDI / I am picking up a decrease in the infra-red intensity.
 WORF / Maybe the life-form has reached its own energy limit.
 BEVERLY / Or maybe this is not the end of it. (at their looks) With single-celled life-forms... at least organic ones, cell division can be preceded by a resting state.
 RIKER / The calm before the storm.
 PICARD / Let's use the calm. Medical Lab on main viewer.
 DATA / It does seem dormant.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Yar - set coordinates to beam it back where it came from.
 TASHA / (hits buttons, and:) Coordinates set.
 PICARD / Energize!
 RIKER / Transporter power has been redirected, sir. We are unable to affect it.
 PICARD / Life-form or not... intelligent or not -- the safety of this ship and all on her are my primary responsibility. (moment, and:) Data -- evacuate the air from the Medical Lab. I want a vacuum in there.
 DATA / Environmental systems fail to respond to commands, Captain. It appears the microbrain has successfully interfaced with our computer.
 PICARD / Suggestions? (silence) Anyone?
 PICARD / I need your help. We have communicated with the life-form discovered on Velara III.
 PICARD / It has told us that it attempted to communicate with you, and you ignored it.
 BENSEN / We didn't try.
 PICARD / What you were doing was so threatening to them that they killed your hydraulics engineer to stop it. They have declared a state of war.
 PICARD / Yes, and we're on the defensive. I need your help. I have to find some way to fight them. We no longer have control of the Medical Lab, or the computer. At this moment they have the power to destroy this ship and everyone on it.
 PICARD / They said you killed some of them. I need to know how.
 PICARD / Exactly what was Malencon doing when he was killed?
 LUISA / There is a very thin layer of highly saline water under the sandy topsoil. He was siphoning that off.
 PICARD / Why would that kill some of them?
 BEVERLY / Liquid supports life. Perhaps somehow, that saline water sustained them.
 DATA / It connected them.
 LUISA / I don't understand.
 BEVERLY / The microbrains are like our brain cells. Individually a cell has life -- but not intelligence -- yet when interconnected their combined intelligence is formidable.
 LUISA / So that saline fluid is their circuitry.
 PICARD / And to prevent its loss, they killed Malencon.
 LUISA / (depressed) If we had continued to remove the water... we would have destroyed them all.
 PICARD / Reason enough for anyone to go to war.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain -- it's happening again!
 RIKER / If this keeps up, that thing will tear the Enterprise apart!
 DATA / Captain -- sensors indicate the microbrain expends a tremendous amount of energy during its reproduction cycle. Yet, there is no discernible power drain from our own systems.
 PICARD / Then what's feeding the damn thing!?
 GEORDI / Data and I found traces of cadmium salts. Cadmium is a conduit for converting infra-red into electricity.
 PICARD / Meaning?
 DATA / Meaning the microbrains might be photoelectric.
 PICARD / Okay, let's see if darkness will neutralize them. Kill the lights in the lab, Mr. La Forge. We can at least do that.
 GEORDI / Sorry, Captain, can't do it by remote.
 PICARD / Number One...
 RIKER / On my way.
 LUISA / (seeing it all now) The creatures must have evolved at that narrow layer where the light got through the sand to the water... Drop the water a centimeter below the light penetration level and they starve.
 RIKER / (into com) Kill lab lights -- now!
 TASHA / It's slowing down.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Getting dimmer, too.
 PICARD / We are happy to agree with you.
 RIKER / Riker to Transporter Chief. Pick up the coordinates of the bell jar in the Medical Lab for return to Velara III.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / ... Coordinates entered, sir.
 RIKER / Riker to bridge. Captain, we're ready to beam it back to the planet.
 DATA / I wish we were able to learn more about them.
 PICARD / In time, Mr. Data. When we're better prepared.
 TROI / (to microbrain) Our apologies.
 PICARD / And our respect. (then) Lieutenant Yar...
 TASHA / Coordinates set, sir.
 PICARD / Energize!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41464.2. Declaring indefinite quarantine for the Velara System...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... Returning to starbase with surviving Terraformers.
 RIKER / On the way.
 RIKER / What's your hurry, Harry?
 HARRY / Oops. Sorry, Commander. I was, um, just...
 DR. BERNARD / Harry!
 DR. BERNARD / I'm sorry if he bothered you.
 RIKER / No bother, Doctor Bernard.
 HARRY / I'm not going back. I hate that teacher. And I hate calculus.
 DR. BERNARD / Everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus, whether they like it or not.
 HARRY / Why?
 Riker LIMPS OFF the turbolift. PICARD is at the Aft Station. The other CREWMEMBERS are at their positions. BEVERLY is also at the Aft Station. / 
 BEVERLY / You're limping.
 RIKER / A small run-in with an aspiring sprinter.
 PICARD / Ah, Number One.
 RIKER / A problem, Captain?
 PICARD / A curiosity. For the past several hours we have been tracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source. It's been like following a trail of bread crumbs.
 PICARD / (continuing) The path lead here and stopped -- which is what I knew would interest you.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) What's our position?
 GEORDI / The Epsilon Mynos system.
 RIKER / (with a look of surprise) Really? Thank you, Captain; you're right... I wouldn't miss this for anything.
 TASHA / What's so interesting about this system?
 RIKER / Aldea.
 RIKER / (continuing; to Tasha) Tasha -- I'm surprised. You mean you've never heard the stories about Aldea? A wonderous mythical world -- like Atlantis on ancient earth... or Neinman on Xerxes Seven... with an advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained, peaceful, with incredible technical sophistication which provided for every citizen's daily needs, allowing them to devote themselves to culture and art, which was beautiful beyond compare and valued beyond price.
 TASHA / Where is it supposed to be?
 RIKER / Ahh -- that is the myth -- somehow -- so the legend goes -- the Aldeans were able to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders and other hostile passersby who might rob and plunder.
 TASHA / A wonderful fairy tale.
 DATA / Scanners still show nothing, sir.
 TROI / Scanners may show nothing, Captain, but I am sensing something very strong. (a beat) Thousands of minds, sir.
 PICARD / Where?
 TROI / Very close.
 PICARD / All stop.
 GEORDI / Answering all stop.
 PICARD / Anything?
 WORF / Captain, I am recording a distortion in quadrant one, mark nine-zero.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Shields and deflectors up.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (almost breathless) Aldea, Captain... It has to be.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41509.1. Either by chance or intent, we've been led to the mythical planet of Aldea, which appeared out of nowhere, hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device.
 DATA / Captain, the sensors indicate that the shield is electromagnetic. A complicated light refracting mechanism.
 PICARD / A cloaking device.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / To hide an entire planet it's gotta be pretty sophisticated.
 WORF / (from Aft Station) We're being scanned, sir.
 PICARD / Let's let them know our peaceful intent. Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar.
 RASHELLA / I'm Rashella. Welcome to Aldea.
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. We come in peace.
 RASHELLA / We know.
 PICARD / We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly never thought they could possibly be true.
 RASHELLA / (laughing) Our shield has confused outsiders for millennia, Captain.
 PICARD / A very long time to have that kind of technology. Why are you revealing yourself now?
 RASHELLA / We're eager to meet in person to discuss that, and other subjects of mutual interest.
 PICARD / We're ready anytime.
 RASHELLA / Excellent!
 RASHELLA / (reacting to their astonishment) Our arrival seems to have startled you.
 RADUE / We mean no harm.
 PICARD / It was a little sudden
 RADUE / I'm Radue, First Appointee of Aldea.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard.
 BEVERLY / Captain, they haven't been through decontamination.
 PICARD / It's all right. (to the Aldeans) Our medical doctor is concerned you didn't go through our regular transporting procedure.
 RASHELLA / You couldn't transport us. The only way through our shield is our way, Captain. Our cloaking device may be off, but our shield is operating. We've brought you small tokens of welcome.
 RADUE / And our personal invitation to a celebration on Aldea.
 PICARD / We'd be delighted. Number One, assemble your away team.
 RADUE / We will prepare for your arrival, Commander Riker.
 RIKER / How did you know...
 RADUE / ... your name? We've been monitoring your ship's communications. We must return now to Aldea. Our eyes are very sensitive to bright light. Rashella, Garen.
 PICARD / Amazing. Only to exist in mythology and suddenly they're here, right in front of us. Number One?
 RIKER / Now you know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here by accident.
 PICARD / Counselor? What do you sense?
 TROI / Only the obvious. They want something from us.
 RADUE'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker, is your party ready?
 PICARD / Interesting choices.
 RADUE / I hope Duana and I know how to greet you properly, Commander. "May your light shine through the ages."
 RADUE / (continuing) My apologies. Age has no respect for the body.
 WESLEY has joined Picard on the bridge. / 
 WESLEY / How do they cloak the planet?
 DATA / The theory is simple. The shield bends light rays around the planet's contour -- similar to the Romulan cloaking device -- but the implementation is very difficult.
 PICARD / Wesley!
 GEORDI / Sir, the energy beam is originating from Aldea.
 PICARD / Shields up. La Forge, contact Commander Riker. Worf, check all other decks.
 DATA / Shields inoperable, sir. All decks are being probed in a methodical pattern.
 PICARD / All decks? Everything? The entire ship?
 DATA / Aye, sir!
 GEORDI / Captain, I can't get through to Commander Riker. We're being blocked.
 PICARD / Are you all right, Wesley?
 WESLEY / (nodding) It was scary at first, but I really didn't feel anything.
 WORF / Sir, similar incidents, all decks, (surprised) but only with the children.
 RADUE / Yes, Commander, we are an ancient power. But we've suffered for it. Our history is littered with the deaths of those people who craved more and more things. Nothing was ever enough. So, we've evolved a very simple way of living: for whatever is taken, something is given in return.
 RIKER / It seems an equitable code.
 RADUE / It's given us peace. Unfortunately, there are very few of us left to enjoy it.
 TROI / Why?
 RADUE / That is some of what we wish to discuss. We need help from the Federation to rebuild our heritage... we need a younger generation, strong and healthy, following in the Aldean traditions.
 RIKER / I don't understand. How can the Federation help influence your children in your traditions?
 RADUE / Because we have no children, Commander. Rashella was the last child born on this planet.
 BEVERLY / And your medical community can do nothing?
 RASHELLA / They've tried, Doctor Crusher. And failed.
 BEVERLY / Perhaps we can help...
 RIKER / Radue, exactly why have we been invited to Aldea?
 RADUE / We propose a trade. One which will solve our problem and give something back to the Federation.
 RIKER / And the nature of this trade?
 RADUE / We need some of your children. In payment, we will give you the kind of knowledge which would take you centuries to acquire.
 RIKER / That might be acceptable to some other races, but humans are unusually attached to their own offspring.
 RIKER / We sympathize with your situation, Radue. But what you ask is not possible.
 RADUE / And that's your final answer?
 RIKER / It's my only answer. If we can be of help in some other way...
 RADUE / I am sorry you are intransigent.
 BEVERLY / Wes!
 HARRY BERNARD DISAPPEARS in front of his classmates. / One by one, TWO other CHILDREN DISAPPEAR: ROSE and TARA, eight-year olds.
 ALEXANDRA, carrying a stick-em toy in one hand, / DISAPPEARS in front of TOYA, her terrified mother.
 WORF / Saucer Section reports six more children are gone.
 RIKER / It's the children. That's why we've been brought here. That's what they wanted.
 PICARD / And that's what they have.
 PICARD / Status!
 TASHA / Aldean shields still up. Hailing frequencies open. No response.
 PICARD / Keep trying, Lieutenant. Counselor, gather the parents.
 TROI / They'll need to talk to you as well, Captain.
 RADUE / Captain, your children are with us.
 PICARD / ... Go on.
 RADUE / My word of honor... no harm will ever come to them.
 PICARD / Harm has already been done.
 RADUE / Captain, let us begin discussions regarding appropriate compensation.
 PICARD / (angrily) Compensation! You steal our children -- from their classrooms -- their bedrooms -- and you talk about compensation. Return them... now!
 RADUE / We will continue this discussion when you've calmed down.
 PICARD / I shouldn't have lost my temper.
 KATIE /  / Wesley, I'm frightened.
 WESLEY / I know. We all are, but it's going to be all right. Everyone knows where we are. No one is going to hurt you. I promise. (then to the toddler) Alexandra, don't go too far!
 KATIE /  / She's not afraid of anything.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Harry, don't touch that!
 HARRY / I'm not gonna hurt it.
 WESLEY / I know that. But maybe they don't.
 KATIE /  / Who?
 WESLEY / I don't know who.
 HARRY / Why are we here?
 WESLEY / I don't know that either.
 RADUE / Greetings, Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / How did you know my name? (realization) Oh, through that energy beam.
 RADUE / Excellent analysis. The Custodian indicated you would be the leader.
 WESLEY / The Custodian -- who is the Custodian?
 RADUE / The Custodian is not a person.
 RASHELLA / We have brought you to Aldea as our guests. We'll provide anything you need or want.
 WESLEY / We want to go home.
 RADUE / Wesley, all of you have been chosen because you are special.
 DUANA / Children, we are starting on a wonderful adventure.
 RADUE / Exactly... Just ask for anything you want, and you shall have it.
 ALEXANDRA / Bye-bye.
 BEVERLY / Toya, sit down... You're reacting out of fear. (gently) We all knew what the risks were when we signed on. And that's the choice we made. Captain Picard will do everything possible to bring our children back.
 PICARD / The Aldeans are anxious to discuss "compensation." That will buy us time. I've asked Doctor Crusher to be involved in the negotiations as your representative.
 DR. BERNARD / Why were these specific children taken?
 PICARD / We can't be sure. We do know the Aldeans can't have children of their own.
 DR. BERNARD / Then they won't let them go easily.
 PICARD / I won't insult you by pretending it will be easy. I can only say the Enterprise will not leave them behind. Be assured of that.
 DR. BERNARD / Can we talk with our children? Give them some reassurance. Let them know that we are here, and that they will be safe.
 PICARD / I will do my best to arrange it.
 DR. BERNARD / The last time I saw him I yelled at him.
 RASHELLA / There you are!
 RASHELLA / (continuing) I have you now!
 PICARD / Any response from Aldea, Lieutenant Yar?
 TASHA / Not yet, sir.
 RIKER / Captain, Data has found something interesting. The Aldean shield gives evidence of sporadic fluctuations, weakening its structure in isolated sections.
 PICARD / You're saying there are holes in their defense system?
 RIKER / In essence, yes. It is surprising after all these eons that the Aldeans' use of their technology is not perfect. One would assume they would be aware of the weakness and repair it.
 PICARD / Can we beam down an away team through one of these so-called holes?
 RIKER / It is a possibility. It would have to be perfectly timed -- and there are no guarantees.
 DATA / We may be more successful in deciphering the code they use to transport through the magnetic shield.
 PICARD / Can you do that?
 DATA / Eventually, sir. I am working on it now but the number of permutations is almost endless.
 PICARD / Keep trying. (turning to Riker) Number One, while he's doing that, you find a way of getting through one of those holes because one way or the other we have to get an away team on that planet, locate the power source of that shield and neutralize it.
 RIKER / You're certain they'll negotiate?
 PICARD / Oh, they'll negotiate, Number One. Or call it that. They took what they wanted, now they'll rationalize it by throwing us some sort of bone.
 DATA / A bone, sir? In exchange for the children?
 DATA / (continuing) Oh. A metaphor.
 RIKER / And when we don't accept their offer?
 PICARD / The minute they believe we will accept no compensation for the children, they will end all discussion and disappear behind their shield... locking us out and the children in -- forever. That's why I have to keep them talking.
 WESLEY / Excuse me, sir, where are you taking Tara?
 HARRY / What's happening? I thought you said the captain was going to rescue us!
 WESLEY / He will. It just might take him a little while.
 RADUE / Come in.
 RADUE / Don't be alarmed. The other children have been assigned to their units.
 WESLEY / Units?
 RADUE / A unit is a group where people of similar talents and interests live together.
 WESLEY / Like a family.
 RADUE / Yes, you could call it that.
 WESLEY / We already have families.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Does Captain Picard know what you are doing?
 RADUE / We are keeping nothing from him.
 LEDA / We have been waiting for you so long, Harry. We are artists, just like you.
 HARRY / I'm not an artist.
 ACCOLAN / You will be. And a great one.
 LEDA / This way, Harry.
 LEDA / Unit B -- three seven five.
 RADUE / Katie.
 MELIAN / I am honored.
 KATIE /  / Thank you.
 RADUE / Melian is the foremost musician on Aldea.
 MELIAN / Music speaks its own language... I know we'll have much to learn from each other.
 MELIAN / (continuing) Don't worry, Katie. You'll be seeing Wesley soon.
 RADUE / We're the only ones left, Wesley. Does that tell you something?
 WESLEY / Do you want me to guess?
 WESLEY / What about me? Don't I have a say in this?
 RADUE / Wesley, sometimes things happen which we just must accept. You and the other children are now members of this society. That will not change. It's up to you to make the transition as easy as possible for the others. You are their leader. It's your duty. Help them accept it -- because nothing you, or those on the starship can do will change it. Because like you, we also have no choice.
 DUANA / We'll do our best to see you're happy here. And I promise you one thing: the secrets of Aldea's power will one day be yours.
 RADUE / Where have you been Rashella? Zena and Aran are waiting to take Alexandra.
 RASHELLA / No.
 RADUE / No? I told you...
 RASHELLA / No, Radue. They can't have her.
 RASHELLA / (continuing) I will never let her go.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Aldea. It's becoming all too evident that talk will not effect the return of our children. We must neutralize the Aldean shield. Until then we are helpless.
 TASHA / Sir, Radue is hailing us.
 RADUE / Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher and I are ready, Radue.
 RADUE / Are you ill, Captain?
 PICARD / No. Doctor Crusher is a Staff Officer, Radue. Starfleet Regulation 6.57 requires at least two staff officers to be present during any treaty or contract negotiations.
 RADUE / Very well.
 RIKER / Not much on pleasantries, is he?
 DATA / I am not aware of Regulation 6.57, sir.
 PICARD / Neither am I, Data.
 DATA / Oh. I see.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher, report to the bridge... Now we'll see what they have in mind.
 DUANA / Over here, Wesley.
 DUANA / (continuing) Custodian, Wesley Crusher's voice will be entered into the authorized file -- for Third Level clearance.
 DUANA / Announce yourself to the Custodian.
 WESLEY / Hello, Custodian. I'm Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / Thank you. What does that mean?
 WESLEY / Thank you. Duana, what does the Custodian do?
 DUANA / It frees us from all burden. It takes care of all our needs. It regulates our lives.
 WESLEY / Who built it?
 DUANA / The Progenitors.
 WESLEY / When?
 DUANA / Before my time. Centuries ago.
 WESLEY / ... What's its power source?
 DUANA / Wesley, why is that important? It does what we ask it. It always has. What difference does it make how it works?
 WESLEY / If you don't know how it works, how can you repair it?
 DUANA / (not understanding the concept) Why would we want to repair it?
 WESLEY / From time to time, every computer -- I mean Custodian -- requires maintainance.
 DUANA / (laughing) Wesley, Radue is right. You ask questions I can't answer. Ask the Custodian instead.
 WESLEY / Custodian, can you show me where Harry is?
 WESLEY / Show me Harry.
 HARRY / I never did this before. It's fun.
 WESLEY / You are going to make Harry into a sculptor?
 DUANA / He already is. He has just never been encouraged properly. The tool Leda is giving him will allow him to bring out his visions.
 WESLEY / It will take years for him to learn to do that.
 DUANA / Oh, no. It will happen quite quickly.
 WESLEY / Custodian, show me Alexandra.
 WESLEY / Custodian, show me Jason...
 DUANA / Stop, Custodian.
 DUANA / We must work now... there is much to learn.
 WESLEY / What's in there?
 WESLEY / It's probably the power source.
 DUANA / I don't know. It's forbidden. The Custodian allows no one in there. There's no one left who's authorized.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequency, Lieutenant Yar.
 TASHA / Open, sir.
 RADUE / Ah, good. You're ready.
 PICARD / I want to see the children before we begin.
 RADUE / No. We're here to negotiate for compensation, not to pander to emotions. This way.
 PICARD / Radue, we do not condone your actions. You're attempting to salve your conscience by offering goods in exchange for our children.
 RADUE / Why do you want them back so badly? You can always make more.
 PICARD / We happen to like these particular children.
 RADUE / Humans have great attachment to their offspring. But we're digressing. Returning the children is non-negotiable.
 RASHELLA / I promise you they will have a beautiful life with us. And they'll be father and mother to a new breed born of an ancient culture.
 BEVERLY / What makes you think they'll be able to have children? You can't.
 RADUE / But they will. Our inability to bear children is a genetic dysfunction. It's not contagious.
 PICARD / Radue, we do sympathize. But surely there is a solution which can be mutually satisfactory.
 RADUE / For us, the problem is solved. We are offering you information on areas of the galaxy you don't even know exist. What more can we offer? What more would you want?
 PICARD / A significant beginning, I think. But first I must ask again that Doctor Crusher be allowed to speak with her son before we continue.
 RADUE / You are a very stubborn people. Ah, well, that can be a positive trait. You may see him.
 WESLEY / Mom!
 WESLEY / (continuing) I knew the captain would get us home.
 BEVERLY / Not yet, Wes.
 WESLEY / Oh. I thought... never mind.
 BEVERLY / Are you okay? And the others?
 WESLEY / Okay, really okay. Everyone's been assigned their own units... you know, like families. We're being treated, well, almost like gods.
 BEVERLY / Don't let it go to your head.
 WESLEY / (lightly) I won't.
 BEVERLY / So, what have you been doing?
 WESLEY / I'm learning a lot. They have a computer which they call the Custodian. It controls everything. (lowers his voice) The captain should know this. All their defense systems, the city's environment, everything. And it's all voice command. So simple. But the amazing thing is the Aldeans don't know how it works. They know how to talk to it, but they don't even know what its power source is, and they didn't do the original programming.
 WESLEY / (continuing; normal voice) They said that later on, when I'm really an Aldean, I'll know all their secrets.
 BEVERLY / That won't happen, Wes. I promise I won't let that happen.
 DUANA / You must leave, Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY / Take care of yourself.
 WESLEY / I will, Mom.
 BEVERLY / Wes seems fine. He says the other children are too.
 RASHELLA / Of course they're well.
 RADUE / Captain Picard, you have our offer. It is final. Rashella.
 RADUE / Captain, we want you to understand the nature of your choice. A small demonstration of our power...
 PICARD / What was that?
 DATA / I believe it was a repulsor beam, sir.
 PICARD / Position report.
 GEORDI / It's unbelievable, sir. According to my calculations, we're three days from Aldea -- at warp nine.
 RIKER / They call that a "small" Demonstration?
 PICARD / Geordi, take us back to Aldea orbit. Warp factor nine.
 RADUE / Captain, if you don't accept our terms, the Enterprise will be pushed so far away, by the time you get back, your children will be grandparents.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41509.45. We are twenty hours away from Aldea, and no closer to a solution. Their deliberate show of force pushed us out of orbit and could have disintegrated the ship. In the face of that power, a direct assault on Aldea would be disastrous.
 MELIAN / Now, hold it a little bit more firmly.
 MELIAN / (continuing) That's it. Perfect. Now... think. No, think's not right. Feel the notes inside your head.
 KATIE /  / I'm sorry! Did I break it?
 MELIAN / No. It's all right. You can't break it.
 KATIE /  / It did exactly what I thought... I mean, felt.
 MELIAN / Yes. It's a direct expression of the music within. Now we just have to teach you to structure that feeling...
 MELIAN / (continuing) That was beautiful. Now play something happier.
 KATIE /  / (sadly shaking her head) That's not how I feel. (pause) I don't want to do this anymore.
 ACCOLAN / You see, Harry, I told you you were going to be an artist.
 HARRY / Are you sure? Did I really do this?
 ACCOLAN / Oh, yes. Your talent has always been there. The sculpting tool is just helping you develop it. It's what you were meant to do.
 HARRY / You mean I don't have to do calculus anymore?
 ACCOLAN / You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. What's calculus?
 HARRY / Nothing important. Can I do some more?
 PICARD / Captain's log, supplemental. It has been three days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contact with Radue since then.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Yar, open hailing frequencies.
 TASHA / Frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / Radue, this is Captain Picard.
 RADUE / Welcome back, Captain. What have you decided?
 PICARD / There is room for discussion, Radue.
 RADUE / We will bring you down when we are ready.
 PICARD / Data, find a way to defeat that shield.
 DATA / That may be impossible, sir.
 PICARD / Things are impossible, until they're not.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 BEVERLY / Captain, here's what I've learned. (a beat) Duana is dying. I have no reason to believe the rest of the Aldeans are any healthier.
 PICARD / We're all dying, Doctor. Can you be more specific?
 BEVERLY / They're suffering from some kind of chromosomal damage. It could be genetic, or environmental.
 PICARD / Then that's why they can't conceive.
 BEVERLY / Yes. It also explains their lack of appetite, their sensitivity to light, and their extreme pallor.
 PICARD / An entire civilization that's terminally ill... is it reversible?
 BEVERLY / I won't know until I've found the cause... and you don't need to tell me time is running out.
 PICARD / Good work, Doctor.
 DUANA / I thought growing boys are always hungry.
 WESLEY / You didn't eat anything.
 RADUE / We need very little.
 DUANA / I know you miss your family. But you will grow accustomed to us. I promise. I promise you'll be happy.
 WESLEY / You can keep me here, but you can't make me want to stay. You'll never be able to make me forget. And I'll never be an Aldean.
 ACCOLAN / Have the lesions gone?
 LEDA / Yes. The medicine worked again.
 ACCOLAN / Good. Come see what Harry's doing.
 ACCOLAN / (continuing) Beautiful!
 HARRY / (surprised) It really turned out well.
 ACCOLAN / It is so graceful and alive. What do you call it?
 HARRY / It's a dolphin.
 LEDA / Dolphin?
 HARRY / You know, it swims in the ocean. Like a fish, only it's not a fish.
 LEDA / Ah. A fish. We used to have them in our oceans. I've never seen one before.
 HARRY / I used to live near the ocean. On Zadar IV. My dad's an oceanographer. He says... never mind. It doesn't matter.
 BEVERLY / No. That doesn't fit the pattern. Give me a list of the appropriate medical literature from the twenty-second century.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) There's not enough time!
 PICARD / Is there anything I can do?
 BEVERLY / You just did, Jean-Luc. Now... I have to get back to work.
 ALEXANDRA / I want Mommy!
 WESLEY / (quietly) Custodian's room.
 WESLEY / (whispers) Custodian, this is Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / Show me where all the Enterprise children are in relation to this room.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Thank you.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Custodian, what's your instruction set?
 WESLEY / (continuing) How can I command your attention? Do you have a non-maskable interrupt?
 WESLEY / What is its address?
 WESLEY / That doesn't make any sense to me.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Custodian, what's in the locked room next to this one?
 WESLEY / Thank you. Good night.
 WESLEY / I need your help. I have an idea how we can get home.
 KATIE /  / Why will not talking or eating make them send us home?
 WESLEY / It's called "passive resistance." We don't do anything they want us to do and then they won't want us.
 KATIE /  / Will they get mad at us?
 WESLEY / They won't hurt us.
 HARRY / But, Wes, I do kind of like them.
 WESLEY / So do I, but I don't want to stay here forever. Do you?
 HARRY / (thoughtfully) No, but I like working with the wood.
 WESLEY / Harry, we all have to do this together or it won't work.
 HARRY / Okay. I'll do it.
 RASHELLA / What are you all doing here together?
 RASHELLA / (continuing) What is going on here?
 RASHELLA / (continuing) Garen!
 RASHELLA / (continuing) Take the children back to their units.
 BEVERLY / The Aldeans are suffering from a form of radiation poisoning.
 PICARD / And that's what's made the Aldeans sterile?
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 PICARD / Is it reversible?
 BEVERLY / Of course.
 DATA / Captain, these permutations are going to take a very long time.
 PICARD / How long?
 DATA / Weeks.
 RIKER / Captain, there is another option. We have identified a weakness in the shield.
 GEORDI / But it's not constant.
 WORF / It's a hole.
 GEORDI / It's not a hole as much as it is a fluctuation.
 RIKER / Still, there is a chance. Captain, if we can time it exactly -- I think we can beam a team through the hole and onto the planet.
 PICARD / Then why can't we beam the children up through the hole?
 RIKER / The timing would be more difficult, and the risk greater.
 PICARD / What are you suggesting, Number One?
 RIKER / Beam through the hole. Locate the source of the shield, and knock it out.
 PICARD / I'll try to delay the Aldeans until you're ready.
 LEDA / Will you at least eat?
 WESLEY / I know you're hungry. We all are, but Alexandra, we are not going to eat anything. It's our way of telling them that we want to go home. Do you understand?
 RADUE / Captain Picard. You may come down now to conclude our discussion, or your ship may leave. It is your choice.
 RIKER / We are ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude these negotiations.
 WORF / Transporter room, now!
 RIKER / Energize.
 RADUE / Before we begin, Captain, you must speak with the children. It seems they are on some sort of "strike." I don't understand it. You must deal with this, Captain. I'm not very good with children.
 PICARD / A strike? I'll see what I can do.
 WESLEY / Sir! We knew you'd come!
 PICARD / It's not over yet, Wesley.
 WESLEY / Captain, I think I figured out their computer controls -- I'm not sure, it's a different system than ours.
 PICARD / Good, Wesley. Now...
 HARRY / (interrupting) ...Captain.
 PICARD / Yes, Harry.
 HARRY / If something happens and you have to leave us here -- tell my Dad... I'm sorry I made him angry... and I miss him.
 PICARD / I will tell him, Harry, and I will tell him how much I admire his son.
 DATA / This is it, Commander.
 DATA / (continuing) It is programmed to accept only authorized voice commands.
 RIKER / So we can't override.
 DATA / No. But I can intermix the input so nobody else can.
 RIKER / We must find the power supply for the shield.
 RADUE / What is this?
 PICARD / They want to go home.
 RADUE / No. They're staying.
 PICARD / (his communicator) Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We are in position.
 PICARD / Hold for orders.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / (with persuasion) The radiation levels on Aldea have built up over a long period of time. It is similar to what was experienced on Earth in the twenty-first century, when the ozone layer deteriorated and the surface of the planet was flooded with ultraviolet radiation.
 PICARD / The shield that protects your world in one way has weakened it in another. It's the radiation of your own sun which is destroying you.
 RADUE / You are trying to confuse the issue.
 BEVERLY / Please listen. You're all suffering from a kind of poisoning. Sterility is only the latest symptom. If the children remain, they will be affected as well.
 RADUE / It is impossible. Our scientists would have known.
 BEVERLY / How could they? Your scientists have forgotten how everything works.
 RADUE / No. It's a lie. Send them back to their ship.
 RASHELLA / Wait. No. What if they're right? Instead of the children being our hope, what if we are just condeming them to our fate?
 RADUE / They are just protecting their own interests.
 RASHELLA / As are we. But hear them out. The captain and Doctor Crusher are saying our entire life is based on a misconception, and the very thing which has given us this wonderful world is the very thing which has caused this tragedy?
 PICARD / That is exactly it. The shield that protects you, has weakened and your computer has controlled your lives so completely you've lost the desire to even question it.
 RADUE / Lies. The discussion is over.
 PICARD / Commander Riker.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / I assume you have control of the computer.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We've disabled the system temporarily and we've found the power source to the shield and we've neutralized it.
 PICARD / Good. (using com) Enterprise, this is Picard. Beam the children up.
 HARRY / Wait.
 HARRY / (continuing) Thank you.
 ACCOLAN / Let me get the dolphin for you to take with you.
 HARRY / No. You keep it. I'll make another.
 PICARD / Beam them up.
 RADUE / You've destroyed us.
 PICARD / We are not here to destroy you, Radue. We can help you.
 RADUE / What is it?
 PICARD / The legacy your Progenitors left you, Radue. The source of your power. And your problems.
 DATA / It is reading incredible amounts of energy, sir. Even more since we have taken down the shield.
 RASHELLA / What are we going to do with it?
 RADUE / Learn all over again... all this time we've been destroying ourselves. So secure, so sure of our technological invulnerability. Now...
 PICARD / Will you let us help?
 RADUE / Yes. Please.
 HARRY / Dad, I want to be an artist. And I don't want to take calculus anymore.
 DR. BERNARD / You can be anything you want, Harry. Anything. But you still have to take calculus.
 HARRY / Okay. Thanks, Dad.
 DATA / It worked well, sir.
 PICARD / Are you finished?
 BEVERLY / Yes. They're responding very well to the treatment, but for this to work, they can never use their shield or be cloaked again.
 PICARD / The legend will die, but the people will live.
 TROI / And we know they'll make good parents.
 PICARD / Wesley!
 WESLEY / Sorry, sir. She just wanted to give you a present for bringing her back to her mommy.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, out of orbit. Warp five.
 GEORDI / (coughing) Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
 WESLEY is running down the corridor after someone. / 
 WESLEY / Hey, Jake! Wait a second!
 JAKE KURLAND, eighteen, dark-haired and intense, stops / and waits for Wesley.
 WESLEY / (continuing) How're you doing?
 JAKE / (tries to smile) I'm fine. Really.
 WESLEY / I'm real sorry...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Acting Ensign Crusher, report to Deck Twenty-one Forward Lounge.
 JAKE / It's not your fault.
 WESLEY / Yes, I know, but I wish we were both going.
 JAKE / (shrugging) Only thirty-two points...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Acting Ensign Crusher, respond.
 WESLEY / I'm on my way.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Gotta go.
 JAKE / Do well for both of us.
 WESLEY / Mom, I can't be late.
 BEVERLY / Don't worry. You have time.
 RIKER / Happy Birthday, Wesley!
 WESLEY / Thanks everybody. But it's not until next month.
 RIKER / Close enough.
 TROI / You won't be here next month. After you pass the entrance exam, you'll be on your way to Starfleet Academy.
 BEVERLY / Go on, make a wish.
 RIKER / You'll breeze through those tests.
 WESLEY / I hope so, sir.
 RIKER / I know so. I remember how tough it was for me.
 RIKER / (continuing) But you've got brains, and family tradition, and actual experience.
 WESLEY / I wish I felt that sure.
 GEORDI / I was scared to death the whole time. But it's good for you. Keeps your adrenaline going. Not that you'll need it, Wes.
 DATA / Thank you... Humans are fascinating. They celebrate the passage of time with such joy until a certain age, and then it becomes a topic of some discomfort. I suppose it is because each birthday is another step towards inevitable death. Do Klingons observe birthdays, Worf?
 WORF / Klingons are born, live as warriors, and die.
 DATA / Then how do you know how old you are?
 WORF / I don't. Do you know?
 DATA / I have no age.
 BEVERLY / Is there something wrong?
 DATA / No. I am simply trying to understand the celebration of aging. And how old were you when Wesley was born, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Have some cake, Data.
 DATA / I do not understand, sir. Why...
 PICARD / You never ask a woman her age, Mister Data.
 DATA / I am very confused, sir.
 PICARD / Some customs will never change.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Acting Ensign Crusher, this is the Transporter Room. We are ready to beam you down to Relva 7.
 WESLEY / (to the party) Thanks for the party, everyone. And the good wishes.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (touching his communicator) Picard here.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / We've received communication from Relva 7 that Admiral Gregory Quinn is about to beam aboard, sir.
 PICARD / Admiral Gregory Quinn. Why wasn't I informed earlier, Lieutenant Yar?
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / We just received the request, sir.
 PICARD / I'm on my way to the Transporter Room, Lieutenant. Number One!
 PICARD / This is unexpected. Welcome aboard, Admiral.
 QUINN / Thank you. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Dexter Remmick.
 REMMICK / Sir.
 PICARD / Allow me to present my staff: First Officer William Riker, Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher, chief of security, Lieutenant Tasha Yar.
 PICARD / (continuing) What can we do for you?
 QUINN / I need to speak with you.
 PICARD / Certainly. This way. Number One.
 QUINN / No. Alone.
 PICARD / Is this personal?
 QUINN / Official business.
 PICARD / Then my first officer...
 QUINN / ... Alone, Captain.
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41416. 2. We are orbiting Relva 7, one of the testing sites where final examinations are taking place for entrance into Starfleet Academy. But with the appearance of my old colleague, Admiral Gregory Quinn, our stay has taken on another meaning.
 QUINN / Commander Remmick is with the Inspector General's office.
 PICARD / Oh?
 QUINN / He'll be conducting a complete investigation of the Enterprise.
 PICARD / What are you looking for?
 QUINN / I have reason to believe there may be something very wrong on this ship... very wrong.
 PICARD / Tell me what you suspect.
 QUINN / No. It's... inappropriate to discuss it now. We'll go over it fully when Mister Remmick concludes his investigation. (turns to Remmick) You will find out what is wrong on this ship. Starfleet is depending on you.
 REMMICK / Yes, sir. (glances at Picard) Nothing and no one will stand in my way.
 QUINN / And you, Captain, are ordered to cooperate in every way necessary with the investigation. Clear?
 PICARD / Yes, sir.
 QUINN / Mister Remmick, unless there are further questions...
 REMMICK / No questions, sir.
 QUINN / Get on with your duties.
 REMMICK / Yes, sir!
 PICARD / Greg, we've known each other for years. If you weren't just motivating young Mister Remmick, tell me what you believe is wrong.
 QUINN / Captain, it is vitally important that my orders are followed exactly. I'll be staying on the ship.
 PICARD / As you wish, Admiral.
 OLIANA / What is it?
 WESLEY / What?
 OLIANA / The unit you just put down. Don't worry. I won't tell anybody.
 WESLEY / Oh. It's a flux coordinating sensor.
 OLIANA / I'm Oliana Mirren, one of the other finalists. You must be Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / Yeah! You know me?
 OLIANA / I heard there was a very smart, very young man who'd be tough competition.
 WESLEY / (embarrassed) Well, you wouldn't be here if...
 OLIANA / ... I weren't smart? I know. But there's a lot more to it than that. You're lucky - you've had practical experience on the Enterprise.
 WESLEY / Wesley Crusher, from the Enterprise.
 WESLEY / Uh, I'll be sixteen next month.
 OLIANA / (pats him on the shoulder) Happy birthday. When this is all over, we'll celebrate.
 WESLEY / Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher.
 MORDOCK / Mordock.
 WESLEY / Mordock? The Mordock? The Benzite who constructed the Mordock Strategy? I thought you already were in the Academy.
 MORDOCK / No. Only a hopeful, like you.
 WESLEY / You're a legend in the Galactic Computer Network...
 CHANG / Finalists, please take your seats...
 CHANG / (continuing) I'm TAC Officer Chang. Welcome. You are here because you are all top candidates. Although only one student will be chosen for the Academy, you have shown from the preliminary testing that any of you could easily qualify. (makes eye contact with each) We are looking for the person who combines all the important qualities necessary to be part of Starfleet's future. Integrity, intelligence, courage, imagination... and that indefinable quality of leadership. This may be the most difficult, exhausting experience of your life. And the most exciting challenge. Expect the unexpected... May you all do your best... Now, we'll begin.
 DATA / May I help you, Mister Remmick?
 REMMICK / Just keep on doing whatever it is you're doing, Commander Data.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / There's nothing much to see here, Commander. We're in standard orbit. And, uh, the station has to be manned, even if it's routine...
 RIKER / Is there something I can help you with, Mister Remmick?
 REMMICK / When I'm ready, Mister Riker, I'll want to speak with you. Privately.
 GEORDI / Just having that guy around makes me feel guilty. (to Riker) Commander, what's this guy after?
 RIKER / I don't know, Geordi. But I'm going to find out. Now.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Captain, may I speak frankly?
 PICARD / Always, Number One.
 RIKER / As executive officer, I should be informed. I should know everything you know.
 PICARD / I agree. You should.
 RIKER / What's this about? Remmick is going to turn this ship upside down.
 PICARD / That is his job.
 RIKER / And mine is to make sure the ship runs smoothly.
 PICARD / Which you do very well.
 RIKER / Sir, am I under investigation?
 PICARD / I don't know.
 RIKER / And if you did?
 PICARD / I couldn't tell you.
 RIKER / I don't understand, sir. This is extremely frustrating.
 PICARD / No less so for me. But I have promised full cooperation. And we shall give it.
 RIKER / Sir.
 REMMICK / I want some answers from you now, Commander Riker.
 RIKER / Later.
 REMMICK / You were ordered to cooperate...
 RIKER / When it doesn't interfere with my duty. Not now, Remmick!
 MORDOCK / I admit, Wesley, you have a very fast mind.
 WESLEY / As soon as I realized it was a trick question, there was only one answer.
 MORDOCK / Yes. There is only one "ratio" with matter-antimatter. One to one.
 OLIANA / You're both very lucky. I can't imagine what it feels like to have things come so easily. I have to push every step of the way.
 WESLEY / Oh, no, Oliana, it doesn't come easily. I have to study all the time. Mordock's the one who's brilliant.
 OLIANA / You really don't know, do you? It's a good thing you're cute, Wesley, or you could really be obnoxious.
 OLIANA / (continuing) See you later.
 WESLEY / Did you hear that Mordock? She said I was cute!
 MORDOCK / Is that good, Wesley?
 WESLEY / I don't know. I think so. Maybe. I don't know.
 MORDOCK / Perhaps I was incorrect about the speed of your thought processes, Wesley.
 RIKER / Captain, I think I should apologize.
 PICARD / No need, Number One. Mister Remmick's presence is unnerving, to say the least.
 RIKER / Regardless, sir, I should realize that whatever your reasons are, they're valid. Whether or not I understand them.
 REMMICK / Are you available now, Mister Riker? Or do you still have duties to perform?
 RIKER / I'm available, Mister Remmick.
 REMMICK / Any problem with using your Ready Room, Captain?
 TASHA / I'll find him a comfortable place on Deck Fifteen, sir.
 REMMICK / It's more convenient here. Is there a problem, Captain?
 PICARD / No, Mister Remmick. Be my guest.
 REMMICK / There are several seeming discrepancies in the captain's log. Let's go over them, one by one, shall we?
 RIKER / The captain's log?
 REMMICK / Yes. To your knowledge, has the captain ever falsified a log?
 RIKER / Have you discussed this with him?
 REMMICK / Right now, I'm asking you.
 RIKER / If you want to discuss anything about Captain Picard, bring him in here and ask him face to face.
 REMMICK / You are required to answer my questions, Mister Riker. Unless you're trying to cover something up? Now, there are several discrepancies in the captain's log. Shall we go over them, one by one?
 RIKER / Proceed.
 REMMICK / Do you believe the captain is emotionally and psychologically fit for command of this starship? There is nothing in his history or his personality that might suggest... mental lapses?
 TROI / Nothing.
 REMMICK / Not even the Ferengi incident with his old ship, the Stargazer?
 TROI / He was being controlled by a mind-altering machine, Commander. Without his knowledge.
 REMMICK / I would say that was a mental lapse.
 REMMICK / So, you are saying Captain Picard had no control over this vessel. He handed it over to Kosinski, who took the entire crew to some sort of "alternate" universe.
 GEORDI / No, sir. That's not what I'm saying. Kosinski was sent by Starfleet to improve our warp drive. The captain was ordered to take him aboard.
 REMMICK / According to his own logs, the bridge crew didn't think highly of Mister Kosinski's theories, yet the captain allowed him access to the engines anyway. Is that true, La Forge?
 GEORDI / Not exactly, sir.
 REMMICK / One way or the other, La Forge, Picard lost control of this ship. Is that true?
 GEORDI / Yes, but that's not how it happened.
 REMMICK / So, the answer is yes.
 WORF / Ensign Crusher... What are you doing on the Holodeck? I thought you were still on Relva 7.
 WESLEY / I'm through testing for the day.
 WORF / I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I'll leave.
 WESLEY / No! Stay. I thought I wanted to be by myself, but I guess I didn't really.
 WORF / How is the testing?
 WESLEY / Okay. So far. It's not the ones I've studied for I'm worried about. It's the Psych Test, facing my deepest fear and living through it. I don't even know what it is. I'm trying to figure out what images to bring up.
 WORF / Why?
 WESLEY / I wanna scare myself. What do you think -- Bulgallian rats? Lightning storm?
 WORF / Do those things frighten you?
 WESLEY / Kinda. But's it's exciting, too. You know, that rolling feeling in your stomach?
 WORF / No. I don't know. Wesley... The Psych Test is no more or less important than the rest of the process.
 WESLEY / That's what they said, but it's all I can think about.
 WORF / Thinking about what you can't control simply wastes your energy and creates its own fear.
 WESLEY / (angry) How can they know what my deepest fear is when I don't?
 WORF / (shrugs) By analyzing your psychological profile. They were right about everyone I tested with. Including myself.
 WESLEY / You? I didn't think there was anything that could frighten a Klingon warrior.
 WORF / Only fools have no fear.
 WESLEY / I'm sorry, Lieutenant Worf. I shouldn't ask so many personal questions.
 WORF / It is very... difficult for me to depend on anyone else. For anything. But especially for my life.
 WESLEY / But on the Enterprise you do that every day. Everyone depends on everyone else to protect them.
 WORF / Yes.
 WESLEY / Then you got over it.
 WORF / No. It is still my enemy.
 RIKER / ... With this new extricator, sir, we could eliminate three other bulky machines from cargo space.
 PICARD / Excellent, Number One.
 TASHA / Captain, there's an unauthorized entry in Main Shuttlebay.
 REMMICK / "Unauthorized?"
 PICARD / Who is it, Lieutenant?
 TASHA / The computer reads the I.D. number of... Jake Kurland.
 PICARD / Bridge to Main Shuttlebay. Mister Kurland... This is Captain Picard. Respond.
 REMMICK / Isn't the area secured? I want answers.
 RIKER / Not now, Remmick... Captain, he's going to take her out.
 PICARD / Lock off the bay launch doors.
 WORF / Too late, sir. He's using the flight emergency override...
 GEORDI / Smart kid.
 TASHA / ... He's launching!
 PICARD / Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Mister Kurland.
 JAKE / Captain Picard. I'm going to Beltane Nine to sign onto a freighter. Tell my father I'm sorry.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Tell him in person. Bring the ship back. Now.
 JAKE / No. I can't face him. I'm leaving.
 JAKE / (continuing) I've lost power!
 RIKER / All he's got left are his maneuvering jets.
 GEORDI / At that trajectory, he'll hit the atmosphere and melt at two hundred kilometers.
 PICARD / Probable impact?
 DATA / Atmospheric entry... seventy-eight seconds.
 PICARD / Options?
 TASHA / He's out of transporter range.
 WORF / Tractor beam?
 RIKER / Won't work. He's too far away for a positive lock.
 REMMICK / You're completely responsible for that boy's life, Captain.
 PICARD / (to Remmick) Either get out of my way and be quiet, or I will have you escorted from the bridge... Visual on shuttle cockpit.
 TASHA / Visual on Main Viewer.
 JAKE (V.O.) / The engine's dead. What am I gonna do?
 PICARD / Stay calm, Jake. We'll get you back.
 JAKE / Please help me!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Jake!
 JAKE / It's no use, Captain. I'm going to die out here.
 PICARD / Mister Kurland! You are not going to die out there. Do exactly as I tell you. Take the nose of the shuttle and aim it directly at Relva 7.
 JAKE / Aim it at Relva? I can't do that. It's crazy.
 DATA / Twenty-eight seconds to impact...
 PICARD / Jake, listen carefully. I'm the captain and I'm giving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva. Now.
 JAKE / Okay. It's done.
 PICARD / Good. Monitor your speed exactly. When it hits point zero-two-zero, I want you to restart the engine and pull up, hard!
 JAKE / Point zero-two-zero speed... Captain, I sure hope you're right.
 PICARD (V.O.) / You'll just have to trust me.
 JAKE / (nodding) Point zero-zero-three; zero-zero-nine; zero-one-two...
 PICARD / Hang on tight. It's going to be bumpy.
 JAKE (V.O.) / Zero-one-five, zero-one-nine.
 PICARD / Now! Start the engine!
 RIKER / Incredible, Captain!
 REMMICK / He bounced her off the atmosphere!
 PICARD / Mister Kurland, can you maneuver the shuttle home?
 JAKE (V.O.) / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Do so. Then report to Mister Riker.
 JAKE (V.O.) / Yes, sir!
 RIKER / Main Shuttle Bay, prepare to receive shuttle.
 REMMICK / Very... original, Captain. But how did this child gain access to a Shuttlecraft?
 RIKER / Kurland is a highly qualified Enterprise Academy candidate and fully trained in many areas ... including shuttles.
 REMMICK / And did this "full" training include discipline?
 PICARD / Young men sometimes make rash choices, Mister Remmick. Which is why Mister Kurland will receive a strong refresher specifically in discipline...
 REMMICK / I'll note that in my report.
 PICARD / Full cooperation, Number One.
 WESLEY / Oliana!
 OLIANA / Oh. Hi, Wes.
 WESLEY / I, um, thought you might want to have lunch... together.
 OLIANA / Thanks, but I'm not very hungry.
 WESLEY / Oh... okay.
 OLIANA / It's not you... it's just that Mordock and you are so far ahead in points, I'll never catch up.
 WESLEY / Oh. Sorry. (worried) You're not leaving., are you?
 OLIANA / And give up? Never. Besides, it'll be good practice for next year. See you later.
 MORDOCK / Ah, Wesley. Distracted by the female human again. No matter. It does not seem to diminish your mental faculties. You do good work.
 WESLEY / Me? No, you're the one. I've studied the Mordock Strategy...
 MORDOCK / Are you a player of Benzite chess?
 WESLEY / Sure!
 MORDOCK / If you like, we can discuss this at lunch... I am hungry.
 WESLEY / Me too!
 WESLEY / End of the corridor on your right. Room 406...
 WESLEY / I apologize. An honest mistake, okay? I'm sorry.
 CHANG / Is there a problem here, gentlemen?
 WESLEY / No, sir... I, he...
 WESLEY / Who do you think you're bullying? You bumped into me. It was your mistake. You were rude. (assuming defense posture) Do you want this to become violent?
 MORDOCK / A very strange reaction.
 WESLEY / Not really. When he held up his hand, I could see it was webbed... the sign of a Zaldan.
 CHANG / But you became hostile.
 WESLEY / Zaldans are infuriated by courtesy. They see it as a form of phony social behavior, designed to hide real feelings.
 CHANG / Congratulations, Mister Crusher. You handled that particular incident very well.
 MORDOCK / Was that "incident" deliberate?
 CHANG / It's important to know how you candidates deal with other cultures, other species.
 MORDOCK / Then it was a test.
 CHANG / Yes. Not all tests are announced. Or what they appear to be.
 MORDOCK / Zaldans have webbed fingers? I wouldn't have passed.
 REMMICK / Commander Data, I'm getting very little cooperation from the bridge crew. You're an android, correct?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 REMMICK / And as an android, you are programmed to tell the entire truth?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 REMMICK / There is a problem with this ship, Mister Data. It's in the records, somewhere. I need your help to find it.
 DATA / All the ship's records are available to you, sir.
 REMMICK / This information is very cleverly hidden. Your captain is not what he appears to be. Do not forget you have loyalty to Starfleet above all else.
 DATA / Loyalty is not the issue, Commander. There is nothing wrong with Captain Picard -- or the ship's logs. Therefore there must be something wrong with your original assumption.
 REMMICK / That is not acceptable, Mister Data.
 DATA / Acceptable or not, sir, it is the truth.
 REMMICK / (looking at some notes) Just how did this contaminant come on board?
 WORF / By accident, sir.
 REMMICK / Meaning Captain Picard has no standing procedure for this type of situation?
 WORF / No. Meaning "by accident" sir.
 REMMICK / You don't like me very much, do you?
 WORF / Is it required, sir?
 REMMICK / How would you characterize your relationship with Captain Picard?
 BEVERLY / We're officers of Starfleet who have known each other for many years.
 REMMICK / Everything said here is confidential, Doctor. You can be completely open with me.
 BEVERLY / About what?
 REMMICK / About how you feel serving with a man who was responsible for the death of your husband.
 BEVERLY / My personal feelings about Captain Picard are irrelevant to this investigation. And none of your business.
 REMMICK / Then you confirm the logs are accurate: you violated the Prime Directive with the Edo? You deliberately interfered with their laws?
 PICARD / Yes. It's exactly as I explained it in the log records.
 REMMICK / All to save Doctor Crusher's son?
 PICARD / One of my crew was held unjustly. I stand by my decision.
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister Remmick, you have talked to everyone on this ship. I think you've had enough time to find out whatever it is you need to know.
 REMMICK / Are you worried that if I keep looking I'll find what you're guilty of?
 PICARD / The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go on too long.
 PICARD / If it's me you're after, Admiral, ask me directly what you want to know. Then tell me exactly what's going on.
 QUINN / I need a little more time, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / How much time? I won't tolerate my crew being harassed any longer.
 QUINN / Remmick's full report is almost ready.
 PICARD / I want to be here when he presents it.
 QUINN / That has always been my intention.
 QUINN / (continuing) Commander Remmick, report to Admiral Quinn.
 REMMICK'S COM VOICE / On my way, sir.
 PICARD / This has been a strain on our friendship.
 QUINN / I know. Believe me, Jean-Luc, I regret that, but it has been necessary.
 CHANG / This test will be graded as to the number of problems you complete within the allotted time.
 MORDOCK / I... I can't get... it.
 WESLEY / Don't fight it. Relax into it and just do it automatically.
 MORDOCK / No... it's going too fast!
 WESLEY / You're doing all right...
 MORDOCK / No... no. Wesley, I can't do it.
 WESLEY / (DIALOGUE TO BE WRITTEN)
 MORDOCK / Mister Chang...
 CHANG / Congratulations, Mordock. That was the second fastest time recorded on this test. You all did well.
 MORDOCK / It should not have been that way. Mister Crusher helped me.
 CHANG / Yes. I know. An interesting choice, Mister Crusher. Especially considering how close you and Mister Mordock are in overall score.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 CHANG / You all have an hour to prepare for your last test.
 WESLEY / The Psych Test, sir?
 CHANG / We prefer to think of it as a psychological evaluation based on reactions to various individual problems. (smiles) But the Psych Test will do.
 REMMICK / Sir.
 QUINN / Please sit down, Mister Remmick. Proceed with your report.
 REMMICK / Admiral, I've done my best to be objective during this investigation. And yet, I feel a sense of failure.
 QUINN / Continue.
 REMMICK / I couldn't find what you asked, sir. I spoke with officer after officer, at length. I probed the log reports. And I have found nothing wrong. Except, perhaps, a casual familiarity among the bridge crew, but... mostly that comes from a sense of teamwork. (beat) I'm sorry, sir. I did my best.
 QUINN / Quite. You're dismissed, Commander.
 REMMICK / Yes, sir.
 REMMICK / (continuing) Captain Picard, my tour in the Inspector General's office will be up in six months. When I'm finished, this is where I'd like to serve, sir.
 QUINN / Don't judge the young man too harshly. He's a good officer.
 PICARD / It's not him I'm judging.
 QUINN / Don't judge me too harshly, either. Not until I'm finished. We had to be very sure about you. (beat) Some time ago, a few of us in Starfleet Command became suspicious of problems within the Federation.
 PICARD / What kind of problems?
 QUINN / Something or someone is trying to destroy the fabric of all we've built over the last two hundred years.
 PICARD / What's your evidence?
 QUINN / I can't go into that. Too many other people are involved. But if we're right, this is the most critical time in the history of the Federation.
 PICARD / What do you want from me?
 QUINN / I don't know if the threat is coming from within or from the outside. I need people I can trust in strong positions throughout the Federation.
 PICARD / You have my complete support. You know that.
 QUINN / Not enough. I want to promote you to admiral, Jean-Luc. I want you to take over as Commandant of Starfleet Academy.
 PICARD / The Academy?
 QUINN / Yes. I need you close.
 PICARD / Then there was never a problem with the Enterprise.
 QUINN / No. I had to be sure you hadn't been co-opted.
 PICARD / Greg, the real issue is politics. I'm no good at politics. Surely there are others more suited.
 QUINN / I sense you're doubtful about this. All right. Suppose it's the rambling paranoia of an old man. Even if I am wrong, and I hope I am, you're still the best man for the job.
 PICARD / I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not something I can decide quickly.
 QUINN / I need your answer soon, Captain.
 PICARD / All right. You'll have it tonight, Admiral.
 CHANG / Mister Mordock will be finished with his Psych Test momentarily.
 WESLEY / Mordock? Are you... all right?
 MORDOCK / I will be...
 CHANG / Mister Crusher... you're next. Good luck.
 WESLEY / Hello?
 WESLEY / (continuing) I'm here. I'm, uh, ready.
 WESLEY / (continuing; muttering) Maybe they forgot.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Breathe. Gotta remember to breathe.
 WESLEY / Somebody help! Something's wrong in the lab!
 WESLEY / (to Technician #1) Help me move this!
 WESLEY / (continuing) You have to help me!
 WESLEY / Come on!
 WESLEY / You have to. I can't carry you both! You can walk. Come on.
 WESLEY / I'm sorry.
 WESLEY / Officer Chang! There's been an...
 CHANG / It's all right, Wesley.
 CHANG. / Excellent performance, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Performance?!... That was the test.
 CHANG / Yes.
 WESLEY / But a man died!
 CHANG / Theoretically, yes. You had to make a choice. And you did. There's no right or wrong about it. Your greatest fear has been that you couldn't make that decision.
 WESLEY / Because of my father? Because Cap... someone made that choice and my father died.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / Yes, Number One?
 RIKER / Mister Remmick has left the ship.
 PICARD / Yes. He found nothing wrong on the Enterprise. You may inform the crew that Admiral Quinn is most impressed.
 RIKER / Thank you. They'll be pleased... Can you explain now what he was after?
 PICARD / They were after me, Number One. They want me to take over as Commandant of Starfleet Academy.
 RIKER / Congratulations! What a wonderful choice, sir! You'll be able to shape the minds of the future leaders of Starfleet.
 RIKER / (continuing) You haven't decided what you're going to do.
 PICARD / Yes I have, Number One. I'm going for a walk.
 CHANG / I'm proud of all of you. You've done a superb job. Each of you would make a fine Starfleet officer. It's unfair that only one candidate from Relva will attend the Academy this year -- and a loss to the Federation if the rest of you do not return to test again... Mister Mordock will be the candidate. His results were slightly higher than Mister Crusher's. Congratulations, Mister Mordock. You are the first Benzite in Starfleet.
 MORDOCK / Thank you, sir, but it's not right. It shouldn't be me. Wesley lost points because he helped me. He shouldn't be punished for his generosity.
 CHANG / He wasn't. He lost time, but it wasn't only that... Candidates, thank you and good luck.
 MORDOCK / I am sorry, Wesley.
 WESLEY / It's okay. You deserved to win. Besides, you would've done the same thing for me.
 MORDOCK / Yes. I believe I would.
 OLIANA / Well, personally, I hate losing. So you'd better be ready next year, Wesley. I won't be easy to beat.
 PICARD / Mister Kurland!
 JAKE / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Are you... feeling better?
 JAKE / Yes, sir... I'm sorry I damaged the shuttle. But Mister Riker says I can work on fixing it as part of my "discipline" training.
 PICARD / Good idea. I hope you learned that running away doesn't solve anything, young man.
 JAKE / Yes, sir. I'm sorry I messed up.
 PICARD / I know. But you did keep your wits about you out there... don't forget that.
 JAKE / No, sir. And... thank you for saving my life.
 PICARD / You're welcome.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher? Why aren't you in your dress uniform for Admiral Quinn's farewell dinner?
 WESLEY / I... I didn't think it would be appropriate.
 PICARD / Why not?
 WESLEY / I failed, Captain. I didn't get into the Academy. I failed you... and the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Ridiculous. Did you do your best?
 PICARD / (continuing) When you test next year -- and you will test again -- do you think your performance will improve?
 WESLEY / Well, yes...
 PICARD / Good. The only person you're truly competing against is yourself.
 WESLEY / Then you're not disappointed?
 PICARD / Your failures and successes have to be measured within, Wesley. Not by me or anyone else... But if it helps you to know this, I failed my first time. And you may not tell anyone!
 WESLEY / You? You failed?
 PICARD / Yes. But not the second time. Now, do me the honor of sitting next to me at dinner. I'm going to have to disappoint an old friend.
 QUINN / I wish I could convince you to change your mind.
 PICARD / I'll serve you better here.
 QUINN / This is where you belong.
 PICARD / If you need me...
 QUINN / I've been playing politics too long. Perhaps I see conspiracy everywhere. Don't worry.
 QUINN / (continuing) Safe travels, my friend.
 PICARD / Set course to Algeron 4, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Course plotted and laid in, sir.
 PICARD / You know, we're really alike, you and I. Both explorers to the core... Engage, Mister Crusher.
 WORF / Captain! Communication from Starfleet. They have recorded a disturbance in the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / What is the nature of the disturbance?
 WORF / A battle. Quadrant nine -- coordinates zero-seven-zero, mark three. No information who is involved. They are asking if we can investigate.
 PICARD / Answer "affirmative." (to Geordi) Lieutenant La Forge, lay in the course.
 DATA / Captain, I have no reports of any Federation ships in that area.
 RIKER / Ferengi?
 PICARD / It's a little out of their area.
 RIKER / Should we separate the saucer?
 PICARD / Let's get some more information first.
 GEORDI / Course set.
 PICARD / Speed -- warp seven.
 GEORDI / Warp seven. Aye.
 PICARD / Engage.
 GEORDI / We are approaching the Neutral Zone.
 TASHA / Sir... Sensors indicate several recent photon explosions and heavy phaser activity.
 DATA / I have analyzed the residue of the explosives. They are not of any known Ferengi design. It is possibly Romulan.
 PICARD / That's a name we haven't heard for a while.
 RIKER / And I could have gone a lot longer without hearing it.
 PICARD / If the Romulans have returned to this sector we should know about it.
 RIKER / Shall we move to the Battle bridge?
 PICARD / Not yet. Worf, any further activity?
 WORF / Negative, sir.
 PICARD / Slow to half impulse.
 GEORDI / Slowing to one-half impulse.
 GEORDI / Entering quadrant nine-zero-seven, mark three.
 PICARD / Shields and deflectors up.
 DATA / I have located a ship. It is drifting.
 PICARD / On the Main Viewer.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Magnify!
 DATA / The life-support systems on the ship are failing, propulsion, navigation, and all communication, inoperative.
 PICARD / Any trace of the other ship?
 DATA / None, sir.
 RIKER / If it is a Romulan vessel, it could be cloaked.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Send this to Starfleet. We are entering the Neutral Zone. (to Geordi) Get us in a little closer, Mister La Forge. Stay sharp everyone.
 RIKER / It's Talarian.
 PICARD / Any life signs?
 WORF / Nothing yet.
 DATA / I have identified the vessel. It is the Batris. A general cargo vessel.
 RIKER / Long way from home.
 PICARD / Stay sharp. If this is a result of a Romulan attack, they could still be in the area.
 WORF / Captain. Possible life signs.
 PICARD / What do you mean "possible?"
 WORF / I cannot be positive. The readings emanate from a location near what is left of Main Engineering. There is a great deal of magnetic and radioactive clutter making a positive determination difficult.
 RIKER / I'll prepare an away team.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Yar, remain at your post. Whoever attacked the freighter may still be in the area.
 TASHA / (reluctantly) Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Data, Geordi. Let's go.
 PICARD / Lieutenant La Forge, are we close enough to use the Visual Acuity transmitter?
 GEORDI / We can try it, sir.
 PICARD / Then please do. And Number One - everything about this seems wrong.
 RIKER / Agreed. It smells like a trap.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41503.7. We have entered the Neutral Zone. A Talarian freighter has been severely damaged in a battle. Why, and with whom is unknown. Personal note: I hope this event is not a precursor of things to come, and that the peace which has endured for the last several decades will continue.
 RIKER / What exactly does that device do?
 GEORDI / Data and I have been working on a way to transmit what my VISOR sees. If it works, the bridge will be able to monitor us.
 DATA / It is very restricted. The signal from Geordi's VISOR is so complex that it is difficult to encode and breaks down easily.
 RIKER / That means it doesn't have much range.
 GEORDI / Correct. The effective range is a few kilometers, but we're working on that. (touches communicator) Bridge, this is Lieutenant La Forge.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / This is the bridge.
 GEORDI / I have attached the Visual Acuity Transmitter.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We are receiving.
 GEORDI / I am switching off.
 RIKER / Set phasers on stun.
 RIKER / (continuing) Let's be ready for anything.
 RIKER / (continuing; to the TRANSPORTER CHIEF) Energize.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Enterprise.
 PICARD / This is the Enterprise.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, I am switching on the transmitter.
 PICARD / Ready to receive. (to the bridge crew) Put this on the Main Viewer.
 PICARD / Extraordinary.
 PICARD / I understand him better than I ever have.
 PICARD / Geordi. What was that? Over to the left.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / What?
 PICARD / That -- right there? No -- back. Yes. That -- right there. What is it?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / It's Commander Riker.
 PICARD / To me it's just an undefined upright form, standing in a wild visual frenzy. Can you filter out the extraneous information?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / No, I get it all simultaneously.
 PICARD / It's a jumble. How can you make heads or tails of it?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I select what I want to see and disregard the rest.
 PICARD / How is that possible?
 GEORDI / How, in a noisy room, can you pick out one specific voice or sound?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / It's something you learn.
 GEORDI / Exactly. It's something I have learned. Does that make it clearer?
 PICARD / Yes. Look over at Data.
 PICARD / (continuing) There's an aura around Data.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Yes, of course. He's an android.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / From the way you say that, you must think we all see it.
 GEORDI / Don't you?
 RIKER / Captain - I don't mean to break this up, but...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes, of course, Number One. Proceed.
 DATA / I am detecting high levels of Deuterium gas. Probably coming from the leakage in the drive system.
 RIKER / Toxic?
 DATA / Not as yet.
 DATA / The life signs are emanating from the far side of Engineering.
 RIKER / What's the safest way around?
 DATA / All routes are equally dangerous.
 GEORDI / Which one is the least dangerous?
 DATA / There is no significant difference.
 RIKER / Then steady on.
 GEORDI / Commander, a fissure is developing in the bulkhead. The skin of the ship is losing its integrity.
 RIKER / Where? I don't see it.
 GEORDI / There.
 PICARD / Step closer.
 PICARD / (continuing) It looks to me like a spectrograph indicating metal fatigue. Is that how you interpret it?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Correct, Captain.
 RIKER / How long before the hull ruptures?
 GEORDI / Impossible to be exact. Five minutes -- probably less.
 RIKER / Come on.
 PICARD / I've lost the transmission.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Signal overload. I'm surprised it lasted this long.
 DATA / The life signs are very strong now. They are coming from over there.
 RIKER / Is there any other way around?
 DATA / Negative. This is the only way. I think the safest way to proceed is for me to cross alone. The heat and toxic gases have less effect on me.
 RIKER / Agreed.
 DATA / I found them. The door to their compartment is jammed.
 DATA / The control mechanism. It is inoperative.
 RIKER / This is Commander Riker of the USS Enterprise. Can you hear me?
 DATA / I advise against the use of phasers. The gas buildup is too great, Commander.
 GEORDI / Yes. A phaser discharge now could blow us all out of here.
 PICARD / What's going on?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We are about to force the door.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / What is it? What are you seeing?
 RIKER / Klingons.
 PICARD / Klingons.
 PICARD / Tasha, go to Transporter Room Three. I want you there when the away team returns.
 KORRIS / I am Korris.
 RIKER / We'll handle the formalities later - right now we have to get off this ship. Are there any others still alive?
 KORRIS / No.
 DATA / I believe there is a quicker way out of here.
 GEORDI / Let's go.
 RIKER / Check him, Data.
 DATA / He is alive -- but just barely.
 RIKER / Pick him up and let's get out of here.
 KORRIS / No. I will carry him.
 DATA / As you wish.
 GEORDI / We're out of time, Commander -- the ship's going to blow.
 RIKER / Transporter Room, have you got a lock on us?
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Not yet. Too much interference. You have to get farther away from the Engineering section.
 WORF / Sir, the Engineering section is at critical. Destruction of the Batris is imminent.
 RIKER / End of the line. Transporter Room, we've gone as far as we can. Get us off -- now!
 TASHA / It's not good. I can't get locked on.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / They're out of options. Do it.
 RIKER / Bridge, this is Commander Riker. We are taking the survivors to Sickbay.
 TASHA / (steps over to the platform) I'll need your weapons.
 PICARD / I'll be in Sickbay.
 WORF / Captain. Request permission to join you.
 PICARD / Granted.
 BEVERLY and her NURSE are working on the most seriously / injured Klingon. Riker is slightly off to the side. Data and Geordi have returned to their duties. Picard and Worf ENTER. The two Klingons REACT with surprise at seeing one of their countrymen.
 PICARD / Situation, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / His injuries are serious.
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc Picard, the captain of this vessel.
 KORRIS / My name is Korris -- captain of the Klingon Defense Force. This is Lieutenant Konmel.
 PICARD / Do you mind telling me what happened?
 KORRIS / Not at all.
 PICARD / Firstly, what were you doing on that ship? It's not Klingon.
 KORRIS / We were passengers. The Talarians were taking us to outpost M-Zed-Five.
 PICARD / What was the ship doing in the Neutral Zone?
 KORRIS / We were attacked without warning by a Ferengi cruiser. During the course of the battle we must have unknowingly entered the Neutral Zone.
 WORF / The weapons were not Ferengi.
 KORRIS / What is your name?
 WORF / I am Lieutenant Worf.
 KORRIS / And you are a member of this crew?
 WORF / Yes.
 KORRIS / You are correct. The weapons were Klingon, but the vessel was Ferengi.
 PICARD / What precipitated the attack?
 KORRIS / I don't know -- we were in our quarters.
 KONMEL / The captain of the freighter had no combat experience so he did not anticipate the first attack, which was nearly fatal.
 KORRIS / We took control -- with his permission. The Ferengi called for surrender. I told the captain to agree to all their terms. We had one chance -- I was confident it would be enough.
 KONMEL / As adversaries the Ferengi are not very worthy.
 WORF / Still, your weapons were limited, and their ship superior.
 KORRIS / Yes -- all we had was an ancient battery of Merculite rockets. Our only chance was to trick them into lowering their shields.
 KONMEL / We reduced power and lured them in.
 KORRIS / They suspected nothing.
 KONMEL / Then, when they lowered their shields to beam over a boarding party, we opened fire.
 WORF / Your strategy was very sound.
 PICARD / There are still a few items that are not clear.
 KORRIS / Captain -- we are hungry and tired.
 PICARD / Yes, of course.
 KORRIS / If there is anything more you need to know about this incident -- we will be available.
 WORF / Permission to show our guests to their quarters, Captain.
 PICARD / Permission granted.
 RIKER / What do you think, Captain?
 PICARD / There's a lot more to this than we've been told. Why was the Talarian ship so far off course? What was its point of departure?
 RIKER / And why would three Klingon officers hitch a ride on a broken-down freighter?
 PICARD / Contact Starfleet -- find out what they know about Korris and company.
 RIKER / It will take forty-eight hours for a message to get to Starfleet on subspace frequency.
 PICARD / They are going to be with us for a while; we might as well learn all we can about them.
 RIKER / Do you think I should have a security team assigned to our guests?
 PICARD / No -- Worf is capable of dealing with anything that may arise. (to Beverly) How's your patient, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Not good. I'll keep you posted.
 KORRIS / Tell me, what it is like for the hunter to lie down with the prey? Have they tamed you -- or have you always been docile?
 KONMEL / Does it make you gentle? Has it filled your heart with peace?
 KORRIS / Do glorious battles no longer inspire your dreams?
 WORF / Why do you mock me? Why do you wish to anger me?
 KORRIS / Only to see if it is still possible.
 WORF / It is.
 BEVERLY / He's convulsing.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Korris, this is Captain Picard.
 KORRIS / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I am sorry to report -- your comrade's injuries are beyond our medical abilities.
 BEVERLY / He's dying.
 BEVERLY / Is there any special arrangement you would like for the body?
 KORRIS / It is only an empty shell now. Please treat it as such.
 KONMEL / The opponent that killed Kunivas should have been an enemy -- then his death would have been even more glorious.
 WORF / (stunned by the revelation) If the opponent was not an enemy... who was it?
 WORF / (continuing) Tell me -- what really happened?
 KORRIS / I do not wish to anger you. We are after all, brothers lost among the infidels. (he pauses; then) How did you come to this ship and that uniform?
 WORF / Through an act of kindness. The Romulans attacked the Khitomer outpost. Everyone was killed. I was buried under the rubble and left for dead. A human Starfleet officer found me. He took me to his home on Gault and told his wife to raise me as his son.
 KONMEL / How old were you?
 WORF / Before the age of inclusion --
 KONMEL / That young?
 KORRIS / (with disdain) Gault is a farming colony.
 WORF / When my foster brother and I were of age we entered the Starfleet Academy. He hated it and returned to Gault. I stayed.
 KONMEL / You haven't spent much time among your own kind.
 WORF / Almost none.
 KORRIS / So when the night was still and quiet, and the sound of the blood rushing through your veins filled your ears, the only way to silence it was to slip out into the night and, like the hunter that spawned you, join in the struggle of life and death... but you were unable...
 KONMEL / ... And those around you did not understand. You frightened them.
 KORRIS / They shunned you. Cursed you. Called you vile names, and you knew not why. Even now do you know why you are driven? Why you cannot relent -- or repent -- or confess -- or abstain? How could you know? There have been no other Klingons to lead you to that knowledge.
 WORF / Yes -- those feelings are part of me, but I control them. They do not rule me.
 KORRIS / Yes, to fit in, the humans demand you change the one thing you cannot change. Yet, because you cannot -- you do, for that too is the mark of the warrior. You said I mock you -- I do not. I salute you.
 KONMEL / But, against whom do you test yourself? Against what enemy do you charge into battle?
 WORF / I have been in battle.
 KORRIS / Then you understand.
 WORF / I do.
 KORRIS / Brother, this peace, this alliance, is like a living death to warriors like us.
 KONMEL / You are right, we lied to your captain. We commandeered that freighter -- left the crew behind, and were in search of a place where we could live our lives as true Klingons.
 WORF / You did not fight the Ferengi.
 KORRIS / It was one of our own cruisers sent to bring us back.
 WORF / (surprised) You destroyed a Klingon ship?
 KORRIS / I did not want to battle our brothers. But, we had no choice. Our leaders sent the cruiser. They have been corrupted by the illusion of peace.
 KONMEL / They have traded our birthright -- so they may die in their sleep...
 KORRIS / ... A peace that makes the Klingon heart that beats in my chest wither and die.
 KORRIS / (continuing) Is it permitted for you to show us around this ship?
 WORF / Yes -- of course.
 DATA / Captain, long-range sensors indicate another vessel approaching this area.
 PICARD / Can you identify it, Mister Data?
 DATA / No, sir. Not yet.
 PICARD / Keep a close watch on it. We're too close to the Neutral Zone for it to be random.
 KONMEL / What magnificent battles we could have at the helm of this ship.
 WORF / Perhaps your dreams of glory no longer fit the time. They belong buried with the past.
 KORRIS / Standing here we will never know. The answer lies out there. Our instincts will lead us.
 KONMEL / Instincts that have not been dulled by living among "civilized" men.
 PICARD / I believe, Number One, that was the first time outsiders witnessed the Klingon death ritual. I think I can figure out why they look into the dying man's eyes - but the howling... ?
 DATA / It is a warning.
 PICARD / To whom?
 DATA / They are warning the dead -- beware -- a Klingon warrior is about to arrive.
 GEORDI / Captain, the unidentified vessel is moving towards us at warp five. Intersect in one hour, sixteen minutes, thirty-three seconds.
 PICARD / Can we get a visual?
 GEORDI / I can try, sir.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / Klingons.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / To Klingon cruiser -- this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / We came to investigate a battle. We rescued three Klingon survivors.
 PICARD / These men are not from the cruiser, they are off the freighter Batris. The leader is Captain Korris.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / (to Tasha) Where are they now?
 TASHA / They are with Worf on Deck Seventeen.
 PICARD / Deck Seventeen?
 TASHA / Yes, sir -- next to the auxiliary turbolift to the Battle Bridge. Shall I alert Lieutenant Worf?
 PICARD / No. Send a security team to Deck Seventeen.
 RIKER / Captain, you don't think Worf would allow them access to the Battle Bridge?
 PICARD / Right now, Number One, we cannot assume anything.
 TASHA / Captain, should I stay at my tactical position or lead the security team?
 PICARD / Lead the security team. And Lieutenant -- remember with whom you are dealing.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 KORRIS / We have heard this ship can separate in time of battle.
 WORF / Yes. When relieved of its bulk, the Enterprise becomes an exceptional weapon.
 TASHA / Worf.
 KORRIS / They are here for us.
 TASHA / Step to the side.
 WORF / What is the problem?
 TASHA / The captain wants those two taken into custody.
 KORRIS / Do not let them take us, Worf. Help us.
 KONMEL / Listen to the voice of your blood. You are not "of" these people.
 KORRIS / Yes. Join us.
 TASHA / (urgently) GO BACK!
 TASHA / Bridge -- we have a hostage situation on Deck Seventeen.
 TASHA / (continuing) Bridge, this is Lieutenant Yar -- disregard. The situation is under control.
 TASHA / (continuing) By order of the captain, you are confined to Security.
 TASHA / (continuing) I thought for a minute we had a problem.
 WORF / Oh?
 TASHA / Yes. It looked like Korris was going to hold the little girl as a hostage.
 WORF / That is not our way.
 WORF / (continuing) Cowards take hostages -- Klingons do not.
 KORRIS / R'oiaro.
 PICARD / A Klingon vessel is due to arrive. They have requested return of the renegades.
 WORF / They will be tried and executed, sir.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, understand that I am not unmindful of the mixed feelings you must have about this incident.
 WORF / Thank you, sir.
 WORF / (continuing) Are there no other options, sir?
 PICARD / None that I can see.
 RIKER / He seems to be handling it well, sir.
 PICARD / So far. But he must be torn. These are his people.
 DATA / Sir, the Klingon vessel is within range. They are requesting visual contact.
 PICARD / Open frequencies.
 PICARD / We will prepare for transfer.
 WORF / Captain -- permission to address the captain on the Klingon vessel.
 WORF / (continuing) I know it is against standard procedure -- but there is something I must say.
 PICARD / Permission granted.
 WORF / K'OMGI BIMOGUS.
 WORF / Could we speak English, sir? I am not comfortable in Kling.
 WORF / To plead.
 WORF / Yes, they must be punished, but not executed with dishonor.
 WORF / What burns in their eyes -- fires my soul. I hear their words and I see it all as it was. Part of me longs for that time.
 WORF / Then send them to a planet in the Halee system. Allow them to meet death on their feet with a weapon in their hand. Not tied and helpless.
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / (to K'Nera) Sir.
 PICARD / (into Com) Lieutenant Yar, escort the prisoners to the Transporter Room.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 TASHA / Lieutenant Yar to bridge. There has been an escape. Two of my security are dead. So is Konmel. Korris is loose -- and armed.
 PICARD / Keep me informed, Lieutenant.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Data, visual on K'Nera.
 DATA / Visual on, sir.
 PICARD / There will be a slight delay, Captain. Korris has escaped.
 PICARD / I think we can handle the situation.
 TASHA / Captain. Korris is in Main Engineering.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Korris. This is a futile effort. You cannot win.
 KORRIS / I will speak only to my countryman -- only to Worf.
 TASHA / Captain, he has a phaser aimed directly at the Dilithium Crystal Chamber. At that range, one blast and...
 PICARD / I understand, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Permission to leave the bridge, Captain.
 PICARD / We'll both go.
 PICARD / What's the siutation?
 TASHA / He's on the second level. Armed with a phaser. We do not have a clear field of fire.
 PICARD / How do you suggest we proceed?
 TASHA / Wait him out.
 WORF / Captain. May I speak with him?
 TASHA / I don't think that's a good idea. Right now he's running on adrenalin. Let it cool. There's no place he can go.
 WORF / He will wait only as long as he believes it is to his advantage, the moment it is not, he will fire his phaser into the Dilithium Crystal Chamber.
 TASHA / That would destroy the Enterprise and him along with it.
 WORF / Yes... he knows.
 PICARD / Talk to him, Worf.
 KORRIS / Brother -- I knew you would come.
 KORRIS / Now I... we have a chance.
 KORRIS / I could not do it alone, but I would rather die here, than let the traitors of Kling pick the meat from my bones. With you it will work.
 WORF / What will work?
 KORRIS / I will demand Captain Picard give us access to the Battle Bridge. We will separate from the rest of the ship, and together, we will light up the galaxy. Imagine the fear which will roll before us.
 WORF / Captain Picard will not comply.
 KORRIS / He cannot -- dare not -- refuse us. In order to save themselves, they will give us what we demand -- then, brother, we are free.
 WORF / Put down the phaser.
 KORRIS / Wait. I do not believe this.
 WORF / Believe it.
 KORRIS / I have tasted your heart. You have been with them, but you are still "of" us. Do not deny the challenge of your destiny. Get off your knees and soar. Open your eyes and let the dream take flight.
 WORF / My brother, it is you who does not see. You are looking for battles in the wrong place. The test of the warrior is not without -- it is within.
 WORF / (continuing) Here we meet the challenge. It is the weaknesses in here the warrior must overcome.
 KORRIS / No.
 WORF / You have talked of glory -- and conquest -- and legends we will write.
 KORRIS / Yes -- the birthright of every Klingon.
 WORF / Yet in all you say, where are the words -- duty -- honor -- loyalty. Without which a warrior is nothing.
 KORRIS / What are you saying?
 WORF / Put down the phaser.
 KORRIS / Living among these humans has sucked the Klingon heart out of you. You are a sham. My words were dust upon the ground. Your blood has no fire -- you are weak -- like them. I don't care what you look like -- you are no Klingon.
 WORF / Perhaps not.
 PICARD / Wait.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 GEORDI / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / Commander K'Nera, this is Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Korris and the other Klingon are dead.
 WORF / Yes, Commander.
 WORF / They died well.
 PICARD / Do you wish the bodies?
 WORF / I will consider it. Thank you.
 WORF / (to Picard) I was just being polite, sir.
 PICARD / Commendable, Lieutenant. Mister La Forge, set course for Starbase Eight-four.
 WORF / Really... I have no desire to leave the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Good.
 GEORDI / Course set.
 PICARD / Speed -- warp five.
 GEORDI / Warp five.
 PICARD / ... And Worf.
 PICARD / (continuing) The bridge wouldn't be the same without you.
 PICARD / Engage.
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41798.2. We are ordered by Starfleet, to proceed to the Lorenze Cluster and investigate the disappearance of the light cruiser USS Drake, which was in that system trying to unravel a mystery of its own.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Recent long range probes indicate that all intelligent life on the planet Minos has disappeared.
 PICARD / Number One?
 RIKER / No help from their communications log. The Drake reported arriving at Minos and was never heard from again.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / The citizens of Minos gained fame during the Ersalrope wars as arms merchants. They manufactured sophisticated and highly advanced weaponry.
 GEORDI / For which side?
 DATA / Both.
 GEORDI / We are nearing the planet Minos.
 PICARD / Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. Standard orbit.
 RIKER / Whatever happened to the Drake, happened quickly, otherwise Captain Rice would have sent another message.
 PICARD / You know Captain Rice?
 RIKER / We were at the Academy together.
 PICARD / Tell me about him.
 RIKER / Able. A good officer.
 TROI / How would he react under stress?
 RIKER / Paul Rice is confident almost to the point of arrogance, but carries it well because he usually makes the right choices. He's a risk taker.
 PICARD / Oh.
 RIKER / I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advance navigation at the Academy presents the student with three options. When Rice took the test, he rejected all of them and offered one of his own.
 PICARD / I'd call that arrogant.
 RIKER / But it paid off -- he received the top mark. And now that test has four options. The original three... plus his.
 TROI / In a difficult situation a man like that would react aggressively.
 RIKER / Agreed.
 PICARD / Number One, weren't you offered the Drake?
 RIKER / Yes.
 TASHA / You turned down your own command to take this assignment?
 RIKER / At the time, I thought it was more advantageous for me to do a tour on the Enterprise.
 DATA / Captain -- readings correspond with the findings of the probe. No signs of intelligent life-forms. Vegetation and animal life only.
 PICARD / None?
 DATA / Correct.
 TROI / What happened to all those people?
 WORF / War?
 DATA / Disease?
 GEORDI / A dissatisfied customer?
 TASHA / In any war, natural disaster, or even the most virulent plague, there are always survivors.
 DATA / Captain, we are being hailed.
 RIKER / How is that possible from a planet with no people?
 PICARD / Your sensors indicated no intelligent life?
 DATA / Correct.
 PICARD / Put it on the Main Viewer.
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. To whom am I speaking?
 DATA / It is a recorded message.
 PICARD / It must be left over from the time of the Romulan wars, when the business of selling arms was booming.
 PICARD / Screen off.
 GEORDI / It's a heck of a sales pitch.
 PICARD / If an automated message system is still functioning -- other systems on the planet may also be operational.
 TASHA / Weapons systems?
 PICARD / Possibly.
 RIKER / We are going to have to go down there to find it.
 PICARD / Prepare your away team, Number One.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Yar -- Commander Data.
 TASHA / Commander, I recommend a minimum complement.
 RIKER / Oh? I would have thought otherwise.
 TASHA / We'll keep the first landing party small and mobile. Until I'm confident that whatever killed the inhabitants of this planet isn't still down there.
 RIKER / Spooky. (touches com) Riker.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Bridge. Captain speaking.
 RIKER / We'll start a pattern search from this point.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Keep this channel open.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Commander, our communications are being monitored.
 RIKER / By whom?
 DATA / Sir, since there is no intelligent life, the question is "by what?"
 RIKER / Captain.
 PICARD / Yes, I heard, Number One. We'll try to track it down from here.
 TASHA / Tritanium. It's been melted.
 RIKER / What could do that?
 TASHA / Whatever it was, it's beyond our technology.
 DATA / Over here.
 RIKER / We've never even seen anything like this.
 TASHA / It's undamaged.
 RIKER / Maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer.
 TASHA / Maybe. Let's spread out a little.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Give me a direction.
 RIKER / I can't see anything from here. The underbrush is very thick.
 RIKER / Rice! Where did you come from?
 RIKER / You had us worried. But, I should have known you'd pop up.
 RIKER / Me -- never mind me. How are you? No word, no message... nothing.
 RIKER / Two others. Where's the Drake? Where's your crew?
 PICARD / What's going on Number One?
 RIKER / It's Paul Rice from the Drake.
 PICARD / (confused by the apparent contradiction) Lieutenant Solis?
 PICARD / Careful, Number One.
 RIKER / Understood.
 RIKER / (to Rice) You look strange, Paul...
 RIKER / Do you need medical help?
 RIKER / This is Commander Data and Lieutenant Yar.
 DATA / Other than ourselves, sir, I am picking up no other life signs here.
 RIKER / Yes. I know.
 RIKER / Your mother.
 RIKER / (continuing) She's worried about you.
 RIKER / No... The name of my ship is the Lollipop.
 RIKER / It's just been commissioned. It's a good ship.
 RIKER / Who's here with you?
 RIKER / Paul -- I will only answer your questions if you answer mine. Why do you want to know so much about my ship?
 RIKER / Old friends.
 RIKER / "Is?" Then the Drake has not been destroyed.
 RIKER / Yes, your ship?
 RIKER / Where is it?
 RIKER / Classified?
 RIKER / Ten.
 RIKER / Six.
 RIKER / You haven't used my first name once, Paul.
 RIKER / (continuing) You remember it, don't you?
 RIKER / (continuing) Because you don't even exist. You're a fake -- an image of the original! Aren't you?... Answer me!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Report, Number One.
 RIKER / The image of Rice has been replaced by something which is hovering several meters away.
 PICARD / Number One, get your team back here.
 RIKER / Prepare to beam up.
 TASHA / Commander.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (tense, tight) What just happened down there? Number One! Report!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Report! Report!
 TASHA / He can't answer you, Captain. Commander Riker has been encased is a cube of complex lucinium compound.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Is he alive?
 DATA / Unknown.
 PICARD / Transporter Room Three - have you locked on to the away team?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / I am unable to lock on to Commander Riker.
 PICARD / (crisply) Lieutenant Solis, situation report.
 PICARD / Data, have you been able to assess Commander Riker's condition?
 DATA / He appears to be in a kind of stasis.
 PICARD / Theorize. What's the purpose of the encasement?
 DATA / Typically, the purpose of such an enclosure is for storage.
 PICARD / Which would suggest what?
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / That sooner or later someone or something will be along to collect him.
 PICARD / Stand by. I'm coming down.
 TROI / You, sir?
 PICARD / Yes. (into Com) Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain. Meet me in Transporter Room Three. (to Geordi) Mister La Forge, you have command of the bridge.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Whatever happens below, your prime responsibility is to the ship.
 GEORDI / Understood.
 TROI / Captain! I must take exception to your decision to beam down.
 PICARD / Noted.
 PICARD / What is it?
 DATA / The encasing material appears to be solid...
 BEVERLY / I am getting no life signs.
 PICARD / He's alive. What he ran into is an intelligence gathering device used during the Ersalrope Wars.
 TASHA / Probably developed here.
 PICARD / It projects an image of someone the subject will trust -- gets as much information as possible.
 TASHA / If it's found out -- it encases the subject to await a more detailed interrogation later. Clever.
 PICARD / Can you remove it?
 DATA / Yes -- but I cannot predict the risk to Commander Riker.
 PICARD / We have little choice. Whatever has him is interrupting the transporter beam. Remove it.
 WORF / I am picking up energy readings.
 GEORDI / Captain, this is Lieutenant La Forge. Sensors indicate energy readings in your area.
 PICARD / Doctor!
 PICARD / Beverly!
 TASHA / This one is different.
 TASHA / It's evasive. Data -- I need you. Set your phaser on kill. I'll fire so that it will move left, and you get it.
 TASHA / Captain!
 TASHA / (continuing) Doctor Crusher.
 DATA / Captain Picard.
 DATA / (continuing) I have a malfunction.
 TASHA / Enterprise, this is Lieutenant Yar.
 TASHA / (continuing) Mine's out too.
 DATA / The close pass by the weapon must have disrupted our communicators.
 TASHA / Keep working. I'll look for Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher.
 PICARD / How bad is it?
 BEVERLY / Bad... It's my arm.
 PICARD / Hold on. We'll get you out of here. (he touches his communicator) Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up.
 PICARD / (continuing) Enterprise.
 PICARD / (continuing; he touches it again) Data... Lieutenant Yar.
 BEVERLY / What's wrong? Why don't they work?
 PICARD / I don't know. But it's all right because once they realize our communicators are out, the sensors will locate us and Geordi will beam us up.
 PICARD / (reassuring) Hold on. It won't be long.
 TASHA / I can't find them.
 DATA / Step back.
 RIKER / Data.
 DATA / All vital signs returning to normal.
 TASHA / Good. Now Geordi can get us out of here.
 GEORDI / Good. They have freed Riker. (into com) Transporter Room. Get a lock on the away team, and beam them up.
 WORF / Shields just came on! Deflectors also up -- (a beat) I'm picking up an object off our port bow -- It's firing!
 GEORDI / Red Alert! Battle stations!
 WORF / Shields holding.
 GEORDI / (grimly) But we can't beam up the away team with our shields in place.
 WORF / Phasers ready. Photon torpedoes standing by. Locking on target... (then, surprised) Correction: target has disappeared!
 GEORDI / Full scan!
 WORF / Scanning... (shakes head) No readings. Wait -- something dead astern --
 GEORDI / Emergency power to shields!
 WORF / Object is firing --
 GEORDI / Return fire!
 GEORDI (V. O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41798.25. Lieutenant J.G. Geordi La Forge in temporary command.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / (continuing) Orbiting the planet Minos, we are under attack.
 LOGAN / Why are we still in orbit? We're taking a beating!
 GEORDI / We've got to hold out as long as we can. If we can disable our attacker, even for a few seconds, we can drop our shields and beam the away team back aboard.
 LOGAN / If we follow that plan, we'll lose the Enterprise! In view of the present crisis... I believe you should relinquish command to me.
 GEORDI / No.
 LOGAN / I outrank you.
 GEORDI / Mister Logan -- Captain Picard put me in command.
 LOGAN / The Captain did not anticipate that the Enterprise would come under attack. If he had, would he have left the bridge to you?
 GEORDI / If he had, he would not have left the ship.
 GEORDI / Lock phasers and fire the moment it's in range.
 WORF / Aye, sir. Locking and -- (scanning) Object has vanished.
 WORF / Phaser lock lost.
 WORF / It's cloaked itself.
 LOGAN / You can't fight this thing and win. We've got to break orbit -- now.
 GEORDI / Worf -- analyze its firing pattern. Maybe we can anticipate its location.
 WORF / Aye. (to Solis) Correlate the trajectory of the energy bolts with the attack path. I'll compute the optimum spread of phasers and photon torpedoes to hit it.
 LOGAN / (protesting) Lieutenant La Forge.
 LOGAN / (continuing; softer) Geordi -- I know you want to do what's best for the Enterprise. So do I. Now... the best thing...
 GEORDI / The best thing is for this discussion to end and for you to get on with your duties. I am in charge until relieved by Commander Riker or Captain Picard.
 LOGAN / You are ignoring my greater rank and experience.
 GEORDI / Not at all, I'm counting on it. Get back to Engineering and find me every scrap of extra power you can. The more we can channel to the shields, the longer we can hold out.
 LOGAN / All right.
 GEORDI / Have you got a lock on it?
 WORF / Impossible to be sure.
 TASHA / Maybe you should wait here while Data and I search for Doctor Crusher and Captain Picard.
 RIKER / I'm a little groggy, but I'll be all right.
 DATA / I am getting energy readings.
 TASHA / We'll do it just like before.
 TASHA / It's got a deflector shield.
 DATA / The product continues to upgrade and improve.
 TASHA / Spread out. We'll concentrate our fire and try to collapse its shield.
 TASHA / (continuing) You're right, they keep getting better.
 DATA / Commander, the weapons are appearing at intervals of precisely twelve minutes.
 TASHA / That one took everything we had. I don't know how we'll handle the next one.
 RIKER / Then let's try and not be here. Come on, let's find the rest of our team.
 PICARD / Oh, no you don't -- no time to sleep.
 BEVERLY / (barely audible) I'm tired. Very tired.
 PICARD / Come on, stay with me, Doctor.
 PICARD / (continuing) Stay alert, Doctor! That's an order, damn it!
 BEVERLY / I must have lost a lot of blood.
 PICARD / I've stopped the bleeding --
 BEVERLY / There's another wound. My leg.
 PICARD / This is going to hurt a bit, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / (with the faintest of smiles) I heard that before.
 PICARD / Doctor -- you have to stay awake -- you have to help me! Tell me what to do.
 PICARD / (continuing) What else can I do?
 BEVERLY / The wound needs a clotting agent.
 PICARD / I can't find your medical kit.
 BEVERLY / Those roots. What are they?
 PICARD / These?
 PICARD / (continuing) I don't know.
 BEVERLY / Break off a piece and taste it. Don't swallow.
 PICARD / It's very bitter --
 BEVERLY / Good. Pound it into a paste and spread in onto the wound.
 PICARD / I understand.
 PICARD / What do we do next, Doctor?
 PICARD / (continuing) Help me -- you've got to help me!
 PICARD / (continuing) The patient has lost a great deal of blood from multiple lacerations. What's your diagnosis, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Your patient is going into shock.
 PICARD / What do I do?
 BEVERLY / Elevate the legs and keep her warm.
 PICARD / All right. Stay with me, Doctor. Keep talking...
 BEVERLY / Did you happen to bring a blanket?
 PICARD / No, but I'll find something.
 PICARD / (continuing) Keep up your end. Stay awake. That's an order, Doctor.
 GEORDI / A shot in the dark is better than nothing. Let's see if we can get lucky.
 GEORDI / It's all right. You are doing fine.
 WORF / Program laid in, sir. Phasers and photon torpedoes ready.
 GEORDI / Bring her about to two-three mark one-eight-five.
 GEORDI / Fire!
 WORF / Phasers and photons firing.
 WORF / We missed.
 LOGAN'S COM VOICE / Bridge, this is Engineering. I can't hold this power level much longer.
 LOGAN'S COM VOICE / Bridge, this is Engineering. Tell me something.
 GEORDI / (into com) Mister Logan, report to the bridge.
 LOGAN'S COM VOICE / On my way.
 WORF / Deflectors are breaking down. We have less than one minute of reserve.
 GEORDI / We are getting out of here.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Ensign T'su - set course. Three-one-five... mark zero-seven.
 LOGAN / You are leaving them on that planet?
 GEORDI / Speed warp five.
 GEORDI / Engage.
 GEORDI / Hold course and speed for twenty-eight seconds, then come to a full stop.
 GEORDI / If we stay, we'll be destroyed. There are over a thousand people on the ship -- I have a responsibility to them.
 LOGAN / What about your responsibility to Captain Picard and the members of the away team?
 GEORDI / We have a responsibility to them as well. Mister Logan, you are going to take command...
 GEORDI / (continuing) ... of the Saucer Section. Bridge crew - prepare to move to the Battle Bridge.
 LOGAN / You're going to separate?
 GEORDI / Yes. I want you to take the Saucer Section and proceed immediately for Starbase One-zero-three.
 LOGAN / You still won't be able to see that device.
 GEORDI / There are ways.
 LOGAN / (with a little envy) Risky.
 GEORDI / That's why we are going to separate.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Worf, Solis, T'su. You're with me on the Battle Bridge. Good luck, Mister Logan.
 DATA / Commander -- here. There seem to be air shafts overgrown with vegetation. Perhaps they somehow fell through one of them.
 RIKER / Clear some of that away.
 TASHA / If Data's calculations are correct, the next sphere should show itself in two minutes.
 PICARD / You poor fools. The first time you tested it, or demonstrated it... something went wrong and your creation destroyed you.
 PICARD / What was that noise?
 PICARD / Can you stop it?
 RIKER (O.S.) / Captain... can you hear me?
 PICARD / Yes -- we're here.
 RIKER / Are you all right?
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher has been seriously injured. Our communicators are out and I haven't been able to contact the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Yes, we are in the same fix. Is there a way to get down to you?
 PICARD / None that I know of. Number One, those devices are part of a system which is located down here. Another is about to be released.
 TASHA / We know, Captain.
 RIKER / It's too far. There is nothing to hold onto... no way to climb down.
 TASHA / I'm surprised either of them survived.
 DATA / Commander, I can do it.
 RIKER / How?
 DATA / Jump.
 RIKER / It's over ten meters.
 DATA / Eleven point seven five.
 TASHA / Data, you're sturdy, but you're not indestructible.
 DATA / I believe I can safely traverse the distance.
 RIKER / (yelling) Captain -- Data is coming down to join you.
 RIKER / (continuing) Be my guest.
 PICARD / (concerned) Data!
 DATA / At your service, Captain.
 GEORDI / Prepare to initiate separation sequence.
 GEORDI / (with a pause, because it's such a big decision) Begin separation.
 WORF / Separation complete, sir.
 GEORDI / Lian -- lay in a course for Minos -- warp five.
 GEORDI / Engage.
 TASHA / We had better find a defensive position. If Data's right --
 RIKER / And he usually is.
 TASHA / We're going to have company in thirty seconds. And this time... I don't know how we're going to stop it.
 GEORDI / (to Lian) When I order the shields down, you have one responsibility. Locate the away team and get them up here. You may only have a few seconds.
 GEORDI / The ride's going to get a little bumpy. Things are going to happen fast.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Just keep alert... stay calm... and focus on the task at hand. You know your jobs.
 GEORDI / You've been trained, you've been tested, and you've earned the right to sit in those chairs.
 DATA / Another weapon has been launched.
 PICARD / We have to find a way to stop this system.
 DATA / I need to see the program schematic.
 PICARD / Is it possible to re-adjust the targeting sequence?
 PICARD / Data, assign it a neutral target.
 DATA / The target must be specific.
 PICARD / Itself, then. Have it track itself or the power source that manufactures it.
 DATA / The force of that explosion would destroy this chamber and evervone near by.
 RIKER / Got any ideas?
 TASHA / None.
 PICARD / Give me some options, Data... Quickly.
 BEVERLY / Why don't you just shut it off?
 PICARD / (to Data) Is that possible?
 BEVERLY / Why not -- it's a machine, isn't it?
 PICARD / (to the Peddler) Shut it off.
 PICARD / We've seen enough.
 PICARD / If that's what it takes to shut it off. Yes... I've seen enough -- you've made a sale.
 PICARD / Now... end the demonstration.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Number One!
 RIKER / Here, sir. That was close.
 PICARD / (into com) Lieutenant La Forge.
 GEORDI / It's great to hear your voice, Captain. We're a little busy right now. I'll get right back to you.
 WORF / Phasers at full readiness.
 GEORDI / Keep those shields at full power. It'll be on us any moment.
 WORF / Shields holding.
 GEORDI / Ahead one-quarter, heading two-five mark three-zero-zero.
 GEORDI / That's correct. (to Lian) We're going to lose some maneuverability, so keep a firm hand on the helm.
 WORF / (catching on) You want our attacker to follow us into the atmosphere...
 GEORDI / (nods) That's what I'm hoping. (to Solis) Scan for any air disruption or vortex -- cloak or no cloak, we'll spot it by its turbulence.
 GEORDI / (to Worf) How fast will you be able to get a phaser lock?
 WORF / Just watch me.
 GEORDI / Emergency power to deflectors.
 GEORDI / Steady as she goes.
 WORF / Deflectors nearing overload.
 GEORDI / Can you compensate?
 GEORDI / Maintain heading.
 WORF / Number four deflector inoperative.
 WORF / Weapons locked!
 GEORDI / (overlapping) Fire!
 WORF / Got him!
 GEORDI / Come to four-zero mark six-five, ahead one-third, and assume standard orbit.
 GEORDI / Excellent. Energize.
 GEORDI / Ensign T'su -- lay in a course to rendezvous with the Saucer Section.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41801.3. We are crossing through the Zed Lapis sector, where we will rendezvous with Shuttlecraft Thirteen carrying Deanna Troi, who is returning from a psychology conference.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Because Engineering is taking this opportunity to complete preventive maintenance on dilithium crystals, we are traveling on impulse power.
 WORF / Routine deep sensor probe indicates no obstacles, no vessels within a range of three light years.
 TASHA / Short-range sub-space radar confirms.
 WORF / The martial arts competition is in three days. Are you prepared?
 TASHA / If you'll meet me on the Holodeck later. I need your help on the Mishiama wrist-lock and break. If it works on you, I can use it on anyone.
 WORF / A valid assumption. Who is your first competitor?
 TASHA / The aikido match is with Science Officer Swenson.
 WORF / You will defeat him easily.
 TASHA / (nodding) I'm more concerned with Lieutenant Minnerly's kick-boxing.
 WORF / You are favored in the ship's pool.
 TASHA / You bet on me.
 WORF / A sure thing.
 GEORDI / Sir, estimated rendezvous with the shuttle in one hour, ten minutes.
 PICARD / Very good, Lieutenant. (to Riker) It's not the same around here without Counselor Troi, is it, Number One?
 RIKER / No, sir. It seems...
 WORF / ... Sir! I am receiving an emergency transmission from the shuttle!
 PICARD / Put it on the Main Viewer.
 GEORDI / I can't. We are receiving audio only.
 PICARD / Then open the frequency.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Position report.
 GEORDI / I read coordinates three-zero-seven mark one-two-six. Confirm!
 PICARD / Lieutenant Prieto, is Counselor Troi all right?
 PICARD / Main Engineering!
 PICARD / How long will it take to return to warp power?
 PICARD / There's an emergency, Lynch. I need warp drive. How long?
 PICARD / We don't have it.
 PICARD / Whatever it takes.
 GEORDI / Shuttle, this is the Enterprise. Coordinates now read two-thirty-seven mark one-oh-one. You're moving in too close towards a large mass.
 DATA / The planet is Vagra Two of the Zed Lapis system. Uninhabited.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, report!
 TROI'S COM VOICE / This is Counselor Troi. I'll relay, sir. The pilot is... busy. We've lost most of our impulse power.
 PICARD / Engineering! Status report!
 PICARD / Deanna, we'll be right there.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / ... We're spinning around...
 TROI'S COM VOICE / (very controlled) We're going to crash.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We've lost all contact with Shuttlecraft Thirteen -- and can only assume they've crash-landed on Vagra Two. Main Engineering is working at top speed to return us to warp power.
 DATA / Computer indicates alignment of matter-anti-matter completed, sir.
 GEORDI / Course plotted and set for Vagra Two.
 PICARD / Warp eight.
 PICARD / You heard the order. Make it so.
 GEORDI / Approaching Vagra Two.
 DATA / Strange, sir. No emergency signal from the shuttle as yet.
 RIKER / (reassuring himself) They're designed to withstand almost any impact.
 WORF / Beginning a deeper probe, sir.
 PICARD / What is this place, Mister Data?
 DATA / There is no information in the library computer, sir, other than the fact of its existence. No signs of any known higher life-form. Virtually no vegetation.
 RIKER / Atmosphere?
 DATA / Minimum for our needs.
 PICARD / Standard orbit.
 GEORDI / Standard orbit, aye.
 RIKER / I could have set up the rendezvous in a dozen alternate sites.
 PICARD / She means a lot to all of us.
 RIKER / She's not dead. I'd know it.
 WORF / I've located the shuttle!
 PICARD / Life signs?
 WORF / Not yet, sir.
 WORF / (continuing) Still probing. It appears to be buried under a lot of debris.
 WORF / (continuing) I may have something, sir!
 WORF / (continuing) Faint life signs. Very faint.
 RIKER / How many?
 WORF / There's no way of telling from here.
 PICARD / Can we beam up the injured?
 DATA / No. Our sensors are not fully penetrating whatever the debris is, sir. I cannot explain it.
 PICARD / That's very unusual.
 DATA / Yes. I cannot explain it.
 PICARD / (distracted) Yes.
 PICARD / No. Wait. (something is picking at him) Not yet.
 PICARD / I understand, but for the moment I want all systems at full readiness -- especially propulsion.
 PICARD / Assemble your team, Number One.
 RIKER / Right away.
 BEVERLY / I'll meet you in Transporter Room Four.
 RIKER / Yar, Data.
 RIKER / Do it.
 TASHA / Ben must have had no control left, otherwise he would have picked a better spot.
 BEVERLY / Let's go. The life signs are weak.
 RIKER / What is it?
 TASHA / No idea. We'll go around. Just to be on the safe side.
 TASHA / We'll go the other way.
 RIKER / (touching his communicator) Enterprise, this is Riker. We've got a problem.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / What kind of a problem, Number One?
 RIKER / I'm not sure yet. There's some kind of a slick blocking our path. We'll keep you apprised.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Maintain an open frequency.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Analysis, Mister Data.
 DATA / Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell you what it is -- only what it is not.
 RIKER / Explain.
 DATA / There is no evidence of neural or circulatory systems. No internal organs. Cellular structure unknown. It does not have any proteins which are known to us.
 BEVERLY / It's narrower over here. Can we get over it?
 RIKER / Wait, Beverly. How is it moving, Data?
 DATA / I do not know, sir. It does not appear to have any skeletal framework or musculature.
 RIKER / Then what's causing it to move?
 DATA / Perhaps we are. It appears to be following us, sir.
 RIKER / No readings of intelligence. No brain as we know it. But evidence of thought, Mister Data?
 DATA / Insufficient information.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Number One, can you beam around it?
 RIKER / Negative, not enough room, sir. It seems to be trying to keep us away from the shuttle.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Data, is it alive?
 DATA / It is possible. It possesses two of the requisites for life.
 ARMUS / Very good, tin man.
 PICARD / What is it, Number One? What are you seeing?
 RIKER / I wish I had an answer, Captain. The truth is... I'm not sure.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. While on the planet Vagra Two to rescue members of the crew who were injured in a rather strange and unexplained shuttle crash, the away team, lead by Commander Riker, has encountered a strange creature which seems to be able to take many forms, including something which is humanoid.
 PICARD / Go easy, Number One. Let's find out what it is we are dealing with here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Agreed, Captain.
 PICARD / And Number One, I don't believe the location shuttle crash and the proximity of this creature is necessarily a coincidence.
 RIKER / I am Commander William Riker of the USS Enterprise.
 ARMUS / I am ARMUS. Why do you intrude into my space?
 RIKER / We mean you no harm. We have an injured crew in that shuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass?
 ARMUS / That is important to you? That they live?
 RIKER / Yes. Preserving life -- all life -- is very important to us.
 ARMUS / Why?
 RIKER / We believe that everything in the universe has a right to exist.
 ARMUS / Interesting. Irrelevant. But you may now leave if you wish.
 TASHA / We won't without the shuttle crew.
 ARMUS / You will not like it here.
 TASHA / What are you saying -- that you are going to try and deny us access and attempt to force us to leave without our comrades?
 ARMUS / I told you what you can do. You can leave.
 TASHA / Enough. We have people who need attention. We mean you no harm, but do not interfere.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Number One?
 RIKER / The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down.
 DATA / It appears to feed on our phaser energy.
 RIKER / We have no effect on it.
 PICARD / Transporter Room. Get them up. Now!
 BEVERLY / She's dead.
 BEVERLY / I need her in Sickbay right now! Get a gurney.
 PICARD / Yellow Alert, Lieutenant Worf. I'll be in Sickbay.
 PICARD / Status, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / She's dead.
 PICARD / Bring her back.
 BEVERLY / I'm trying.
 PICARD / You've saved people before. You can save her.
 BEVERLY / Neural stimulator.
 RIKER / There. You did it.
 BEVERLY / No. I've got her on total support. There's no independent brain activity.
 BEVERLY / No! Inject norep.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We're going for direct reticular stimulation.
 PICARD / What does that mean?
 BEVERLY / Doesn't matter! Do it!
 PICARD / She moved!
 BEVERLY / Increase to seventy microvolts.
 PICARD / (urgently) Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Eighty-five microvolts.
 BEVERLY / She's gone.
 PICARD / Gone?
 BEVERLY / There's too much synaptic damage. That thing just sucked all the life out of her. There's nothing I can do...
 ARMUS has slithered up the shuttle and covered the / little bit that isn't buried by rubble.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / Your friends have deserted you. They're not coming back.
 TROI / You're wrong.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / I killed one of them.
 TROI / Yes. I know.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / How could you be in there and know that?
 TROI / I felt her die.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / Do you want to know why I killed her?
 TROI / Meaningless. That act had no reason.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / Exactly. I did it because I could.
 TROI / But you felt no satisfaction.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / No, none. It was too easy.
 TROI / You wanted her to suffer. You have a great need.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / I need nothing.
 TROI / Liar. (there is a pause) End this. Let us go.
 ARMUS / Not yet.
 TROI / They won't give you what you want.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / And what is that?
 TROI / To break their spirit.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / Oh, is that what I want?... Then that's what I will have.
 TROI / Never.
 BEVERLY / (enraged) She didn't do anything, Captain. Her phaser was lowered. She only wanted to get to Troi and Lieutenant Prieto.
 RIKER / There was nothing provocative about what she did.
 BEVERLY / It just killed her. No reason. No justification. A senseless, brutal act.
 PICARD / All right. This is very emotional for all of us, but we still have members of this crew down on that planet, so, until the shuttle crew is safely aboard this ship, our feelings will have to wait.
 PICARD / (continuing) Lieutenant Worf, you are now chief of security.
 WORF / I will do my best, sir.
 PICARD / Doctor, what is the status of the shuttle crew?
 BEVERLY / We're still receiving faint life signs. But the sensor readings are fluctuating -- and I don't know how accurate they are.
 DATA / ARMUS is capable of creating / undefined forcefields. In effect, we are powerless to communicate or use our transporter unless it allows us to.
 PICARD / A powerful creature against whom we seem to have no defense. Number One.
 RIKER / This creature that calls itself ARMUS is down on that planet / waiting for us to come back. It wants us to come back. It killed Tasha. It could have just as easily killed us all. It didn't. Troi and Ben Prieto are still alive. For a reason. It wants something -- and it knows we will not leave so long as Troi and Ben are alive.
 PICARD / What does it want?
 RIKER / The only way we're going to find out is to go back down.
 DATA / Sir, request permission to accompany Commander Riker. He may need help -- and ARMUS may allow us through its forcefield only once.
 BEVERLY / I am going too. There are injured people down there.
 GEORDI / Captain, perhaps I can see something in the creature which will be helpful. (to Worf) Worf -- are you coming?
 WORF / I will remain on the ship.
 WORF / (continuing) The object here is not to engage this creature in battle. The goal is the safe return of Counselor Troi and Lieutenant Prieto. I can best accomplish this from the Tactical Station.
 PICARD / Agreed, Lieutenant... Number One, I see no other choice. Prepare your away team.
 RIKER / Is there anything left to say?
 RIKER / Energize.
 The away team MAKES ITS WAY, very cautiously, towards ARMUS. The shroud is still on top of the / shuttlecraft. Riker and the team take an involuntary STEP BACK when they see this.
 RIKER / Enterprise.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Number One.
 RIKER / We're approaching the shuttlecraft. The creature's covering it.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / I lied to you. They came back.
 TROI / Let me talk with them.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / No.
 TROI / Why not? Does the thought of my having contact with them make you uneasy?
 ARMUS (O.S.) / No, it makes them uneasy. They are worried.
 TROI / Yes. Yes, they are worried.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / They care for you. You must be very special.
 TROI / We are members of a community. We all care for one another.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / Equally? None more than another?
 TROI / Yes, equally.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / Now it is you who lie. There is one who is loved more.
 TROI / You were really surprised that they came back.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / Yes.
 TROI / Why? Because the others did not?
 ARMUS (O.S.) / (now it is the creature who is uncomfortable) What others?
 TROI / You can't hide the emptiness from me. The others. The ones who hurt you. Who left you -- alone -- rejected. The ones who make you so angry.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / What do you know of them?
 TROI / Only what you tell me.
 ARMUS SLITHERS OFF the craft and MOVES TOWARDS the away / team.
 RIKER / Enterprise, Armus is moving towards us.
 WESLEY and Worf lean over the Aft console. On the / bridge they spot the change -- and again...
 WORF / Captain. Look at this.
 WORF / (continuing) The force of the energy field around the shuttle just took a dip. It was almost low enough for us to beam them out. Now, as the creature approaches the away team, the energy field increases.
 PICARD / Chart it.
 ARMUS / She said you'd be back, but I didn't think so.
 RIKER / We have no choice.
 ARMUS / I sense anger directed at me.
 RIKER / I'm here to negotiate. What is it you want?
 ARMUS / Maybe I want nothing.
 RIKER / Then you would have killed us all.
 ARMUS / I still might.
 RIKER / Do you want something? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation.
 ARMUS / You would do that even after what I did to the fair one?
 RIKER / Yes.
 ARMUS / If I tell you what it is... will you give it to me?
 RIKER / I don't know... I guess it depends.
 ARMUS / Not good enough.
 BEVERLY / I'm a doctor. I need to treat our injured friends.
 ARMUS / Say please.
 BEVERLY / Please.
 ARMUS / Again.
 BEVERLY / Please.
 ARMUS / You ask nicely. I will allow it.
 ARMUS / (continuing) Stop! Only the "Doctor."
 ARMUS / Stop. I've changed my mind. Talk to her from here.
 BEVERLY / How? (into com) Troi, can you hear me? Troi?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Deanna? Are you all right?
 TROI / Beverly...
 BEVERLY / Are you all right?
 TROI / I'm not sure. Ben's really bad -- I can barely feel his pulse.
 BEVERLY / We have to get you out. It has a forcefield preventing us from transporting you.
 TROI / I know.
 RIKER / She needs our help.
 ARMUS / You have no permission to pass.
 BEVERLY / There are people suffering a few meters away, and you block our path. Why?
 ARMUS / You asked to talk. I allowed it. Wasn't that enough for you?
 BEVERLY / No. I need help to get to them.
 ARMUS / You are ungrateful.
 BEVERLY / You are evil and disgusting. What are you made of?
 DATA / It does not register on my tricorder, Doctor.
 ARMUS / "It?" Does that mean I am not alive?
 DATA / No. Clearly you are some kind of intelligent form.
 ARMUS pulls the tricorder out of Data's hands and sails / it over the horizon.
 ARMUS / Then your instrument lies. It is useless. Perhaps all your instruments are useless.
 ARMUS / (continuing) Don't help him.
 DATA / One meter to your left, Geordi.
 DATA / (continuing) Behind you.
 ARMUS / Aren't you going to lead him to his sight again, robot?
 DATA / No. You will just move it again. I will not help you hurt him.
 RIKER / None of us will help you.
 ARMUS / (disgusted) Then give it to him. I will find something else to do. Wait right here.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / You said I wouldn't enjoy it. You were wrong.
 TROI / Still the great emptiness remains. You sound so alone.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / I am alone. I am the discarded skin of a creature whose beauty dazzles all who see it. But I am its refuse -- left here.
 TROI / You have my pity.
 ARMUS / Your pity! Save that for yourself.
 ARMUS HAS MOVED OFF THE SHUTTLE AND as it APPROACHES / THE GROUP, Riker suddenly feels a great force pull him. He calls out. Data MOVES to help him.
 ARMUS / Touch him and he dies.
 DATA / Enterprise, ARMUS has enveloped and attacked Commander Riker.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I'm beaming you up!
 ARMUS / If any of you leave now, he dies. And so do the survivors of the crash.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. There is grave danger to the crew on Vagra Two. My first officer is missing - attacked by this entity known as "ARMUS."
 WORF / Captain, perhaps you should look at this.
 WORF / (continuing) We have a chart of the energy field surrounding the shuttle.
 PICARD / There are a great deal of fluctuations.
 WORF / Yes - but there is a pattern. Here is when it killed Lieutenant Yar, and here is when it absorbed Commander Riker.
 PICARD / (indicating points on the graph) And here -- and here? Where the energy is lowest?
 WORF / Both times it had enveloped the shuttle and was involved with Counselor Troi.
 PICARD / So when it is provoked in a certain way its forcefield is weakened... Troi must have the answer. I'm beaming down. You have the Conn, Lieutenant.
 WESLEY / Sir, I'd like to...
 PICARD / ... Go with me? No, Wesley. You can be of more help to Lieutenant Worf.
 WESLEY / But...
 PICARD / ...No.
 WESLEY / Tell my Mom... I'm not worried.
 PICARD / I'll tell her, Wes.
 TROI / Imzadi. No... Stop hurting him!
 ARMUS (O.S.) / What will you give me if I stop hurting him?
 TROI / Nothing. I can give you nothing.
 ARMUS (O.S.) / You still resist. Not for much longer.
 ARMUS / Ah. Another human has arrived. A very bold one, too. Perhaps the party is complete.
 ARMUS / You must be the chief.
 PICARD / Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Is Commander Riker dead?
 ARMUS / Guess.
 DATA / (to Picard) I would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment to alleviate its boredom. Therefore, Commander Riker is alive.
 ARMUS / Maybe.
 ARMUS / (continuing) Don't you want to ask me what I want?
 PICARD / No.
 ARMUS / Then, to protect your own existence, maybe you'd better give me a reason. Entertain me. Be creative. Then perhaps I won't kill your assistant. You do care very much about that, don't you?
 PICARD / Yes.
 ARMUS / Robot, how would you feel if you were the instrument of death for your leader?
 PICARD / Don't struggle, Mister Data.
 DATA / I have no control over what you do with the phaser. Therefore, I would not be the instrument of his death.
 ARMUS ignores him - and TURNS THE PHASER ON BEVERLY. / 
 ARMUS / Perhaps the kind doctor would engender more feeling?
 ARMUS / How does it feel facing your own extinction? I won't call it death. You're not alive.
 DATA / It feels -- curious.
 ARMUS stops the game - and DROPS THE PHASER. The / others REACT with quiet relief. Data stares at it.
 DATA / You are capable of great sadism and cruelty. Interesting. No redeeming qualities.
 ARMUS / So what do you think?
 DATA / I think you should be destroyed.
 ARMUS / A moral judgment from something that isn't even alive?
 PICARD / Mister Data... (then:) ARMUS, we are through dealing with / you.
 ARMUS / I have your man in here... and the others.
 PICARD / It doesn't matter. We will no longer amuse you.
 ARMUS / I can kill them.
 PICARD / Yes. You can. But only I can make them perform. They follow my orders.
 ARMUS / Then it is you. Amuse me.
 PICARD / Not until I know if the ones in the shuttle are still alive. I must see them.
 ARMUS / Not possible.
 PICARD / Then our business is complete.
 ARMUS / And you claim you care about your comrades.
 PICARD / I do care.
 ARMUS is silent. / 
 PICARD / (continuing) Shall I tell you what true evil is? It is to submit to you. It is when we surrender our freedom, our dignity instead of defying you. Do what you will. We will take the consequences.
 ARMUS / Wait!
 BEVERLY / He's alive.
 PICARD / But is he all right?
 BEVERLY / Don't move. (to Picard) Everything shows normal, except his skin sustained a mild form of acid bath.
 RIKER / (weakly) So much distortion, so frustrated... it had to get rid of me.
 PICARD / I want you all out of here. (into com) Enterprise, beam up the away team -- immediately.
 ARMUS / You need my permission.
 PICARD / Do I have it?
 ARMUS / Yes. Are you going?
 PICARD / No. Not yet.
 PICARD / Enterprise, four to beam up.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 The four BEAM UP, leaving Picard. Picard APPROACHES ARMUS. / 
 PICARD / I want to see my people on the shuttle.
 ARMUS doesn't answer. ARMUS makes a very slight / motion and Picard DISAPPEARS. (NOTE: This should not look like our transporter effect. the OPTICAL should be BLACKISH.)
 PICARD / Troi.
 TROI / Captain Picard.
 PICARD / We registered a weakening of ARMUS' energy while he was talking / to you. What was going on?
 TROI / ARMUS is very needy, but he can't / deal with that. He denies his rage. I confronted him with it. That must have been when he reacted.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf, I'm going to try and break this impasse. Monitor carefully.
 WORF / Aye sir. (to Wesley) Set the computer. When the energy level reaches two point six point two-oh-five, automatically beam up Troi and Prieto. We'll do a parallel transport of the captain.
 PICARD / How long have you been on this planet?
 ARMUS / Since they left.
 PICARD / Someone was here before?
 ARMUS / Long ago.
 PICARD / They abandoned you. Who were they?
 ARMUS / A race of titans. So they thought. Together, they perfected a method of bringing to the surface all that was evil and negative within them. All this erupted on the outside, spread, and connected. In time, it formed a second skin, dank and vile. They found a way to rid themselves of it, leaving them free of the bonds of destructiveness. Then they left. And here I am.
 PICARD / It must be very lonely.
 ARMUS / You cannot trick me by pretending compassion, captain.
 PICARD / Haven't you seen we humans are capable of compassion?
 ARMUS / Oh, yes. It is revolting. Time and again you rise from despair into hope. From hate into understanding. From aloneness into love. But you are puny. Weak. Vessels that die from a flick of my power.
 PICARD / But our spirit soars. A great poet once said "all spirits are enslaved which serve things evil."
 ARMUS / Picard, it is impossible for you to accept that I am truly evil.
 PICARD / Because you are not.
 ARMUS / I am a skin of evil.
 PICARD / Nothing in the universe is the same as anything else -- but everything has light and dark.
 ARMUS is SILENT. / 
 PICARD / (continuing) They did not leave you because they hated you. They didn't understand you.
 ARMUS / You don't know that.
 WORF / (checking his readings) Energy shields are way down! Computer is beginning transport.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The shuttlecraft has been destroyed to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving the planet. Vagra 2 has been declared an off-limits planet, but the damage has been done. One of the saddest duties I have to perform is ahead of me.
 WESLEY / (to Data) This is where you're supposed to sit.
 DATA / Why?
 WESLEY / I don't know. The captain gave me a seating plan.
 PICARD / We are here together to honor our friend and comrade Lieutenant Natasha Yar. We will have much time to grieve for her in the days ahead, but for now, she has asked that we celebrate her life -- with her. She has left a living will.
 TASHA / Welcome, my friends. You are here now watching this image of me because I have died. It probably happened while I was on duty, and quickly, which is what I expected, and what I wanted. Never forget I died doing exactly what I chose to do.
 TASHA / (continuing) What I want you to know is how much I loved my life... and each of you who shared it with me. You are my "family." (MORE)
 TASHA (Cont'd) / Whoever I was before Starfleet, where I came from, isn't important. I have been blessed with your friendship and your love.
 TASHA / (continuing) Will Riker, you are the best. From the moment you beamed on board, you never failed me. You trusted me, you encouraged me and most of all, you made me laugh.
 TASHA / (continuing; looking at Troi) Deanna... you are capable of so much love, you taught me without ever having to say a word. I realized I could be feminine without losing anything -- something I never thought I could achieve.
 TASHA / (continuing; looking at Worf) Ah, Worf. I hope for your sake I met death with my eyes open. We are so much alike, you and I, both warriors, orphans who found ourselves this family.
 TASHA / (continuing; to Beverly) My friend, Beverly. True to yourself, your ideals. Your fierce devotion comes from within. It can't be diminished. From you I have learned to strive for excellence, no matter what the personal cost.
 TASHA / (continuing; to Wesley) Wesley, I'm sorry that I won't be able to see you grow into the exceptional man you'll be. But I have my vision of who you are and your kindness and innocence is ageless.
 TASHA / (continuing) Geordi, in those moments I felt the most despair, you took my hand and made everything better. Your innate joy taught me to look beyond the moment.
 TASHA / (continuing) Mister Data. Android... automaton... robot. (shakes her head) No. You see things with the wonder of a child, and that makes you more human than any of us. I love you just the way you are.
 TASHA / (continuing) Captain Jean-Luc Picard. I can't say you've been like a father to me, because I never had one and I don't know what it feels like. But if I could choose someone in this universe to be like, someone who I would want to make proud of me, it's you. You who have the heart of an explorer and the soul of a poet. So you will understand when I say "Death is that state in which one exists only in the memory of others... which is why it is not an end." (MORE)
 TASHA (Cont'd) / (beat) No good-byes. Just "au revoir," my friends.
 PICARD / Au revoir, Natasha.
 PICARD / (continuing) The service is concluded.
 DATA / Sir, the purpose of this gathering has eluded me.
 PICARD / Oh? How so?
 DATA / My thoughts are not for Tasha, but for myself. I keep thinking how empty it will feel without her presence. I missed the point.
 PICARD / No, you didn't, Data. You got it.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / All hands, this is the captain. The sun in the Delos system is undergoing large-scale magnetic field changes, producing violent, gigantic flares.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (continuing) We will be studying this star at close range. Even though we will be running with full deflectors, the closeness of the event and its severity are going to create problems.
 PICARD / Intense magnetic fields have a disruptive effect on electrical systems. We can therefore expect an interruption of communications, and potential temporary loss of other systems. As a precaution, we are now going to Yellow Alert...
 PICARD / (continuing) Stay sharp, everyone.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Engineering, this is Ops. Bring all systems on line and direct full power to the shields.
 DATA / All sections secure.
 PICARD / Lieutenant La Forge?
 GEORDI / Course set.
 PICARD / Half impulse.
 GEORDI / Half impulse, aye.
 PICARD / On Main Viewer.
 PICARD / Mask out the photosphere.
 PICARD / Magnify. Quadrant one-seven, sector four-zero-three.
 RIKER / I've never seen anything like this before. The violence of these eruptions is awesome.
 PICARD / And humbling, Number One.
 DATA / Reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptive prominences, sir. The magnetic field is extremely irregular.
 WESLEY / Captain, deflectors are being hit by a huge burst of X-rays.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Wow -- look! (getting professional) Sir, my console seems to be overloading.
 WORF / The X-ray burst is disrupting systems, Captain. I'm adjusting deflectors to compensate.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Increase power to forward deflectors.
 PICARD / Status report.
 WORF / All systems operational, sir.
 TROI / Captain. The level of tension on the ship is mounting.
 PICARD / Understandable. Data?
 DATA / If we are to investigate this unusual solar activity -- we must get closer.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, move us closer.
 PICARD / (continuing) We'll be pushing our deflectors to the limit, but we'll get a good look at this phenomenon.
 WORF / Captain, I have intercepted what seems to be a distress signal.
 PICARD / Let me hear it.
 DATA / The transmission is from a freighter in orbit around the fourth planet of the system. However, the receiving station is on the third planet.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequency.
 TASHA / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / Unidentified freighter, this is the USS Enterprise. May we be of assistance?
 T'JON (V.O) / (a garbled response) Whoever you are, YES! (garbled) .... cannot maintain... (garbled) ... if you can help...
 PICARD / Can't you enhance the image?
 TASHA / Too much interference.
 PICARD / Set a course to intersect with the freighter. Warp two.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Maintain Yellow Alert.
 T'JON (V.O.) / Can't control... (garbled) ... ship is losing orbit... (garbled) ... heading into atmosphere... without help, we'll burn up.
 WORF / It is a freighter -- very old.
 DATA / Captain, our sensors are being severely affected by the sun flares.
 PICARD / Helm -- get us in as close as possible to the freighter's orbit.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 DATA / There are six life forms aboard the freighter.
 WORF / Captain, the freighter's orbit is decaying.
 PICARD / How long until it loses integrity?
 WORF / A matter of minutes.
 PICARD / (he touches his arm-panel) Unidentified freighter, this is the USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / Put this on the Main Viewer.
 TASHA / The visual transmission is still breaking up.
 PICARD / Freighter, this is the Enterprise. What is your situation?
 T'JON (V.O.) / ... (garbled) ... We are...
 SOBI (V.O.) / Get us off here.
 LANGOR (V.O.) / (female) Please -- help us.
 PICARD / This is the Enterprise -- with all this interference it is difficult to copy your transmission -- if you all talk at once... it is impossible. Now -- please -- say again. What is your situation?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / I am T'Jon -- the captain of the Sanction.
 PICARD / (to himself) At last. (to T'Jon) How can we help?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / We have lost -- I don't know... something -- and I am no longer able to maintain this orbit, nor am I able to use main thrusters. Everything's just kind of... you know... dead, I guess. It's all... you know... shut down.
 PICARD / That's very vague. What's the computer analysis?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / The computer's not working very well.
 PICARD / Data... can you tap into their computer and clarify the situation?
 DATA / I will attempt it.
 TASHA / Captain, the tractor beam is available, if you want it.
 RIKER / At least we can pull them out of orbit before they enter the atmosphere.
 PICARD / Yes. Captain T'Jon -- we are going to lock on our tractor beam and pull you out of orbit.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Hey -- that's great.
 TASHA / The solar flares are interfering with the tractor beam, Captain. I am unable to lock on.
 WORF / Captain, the freighter's orbit continues to deteriorate.
 PICARD / Captain T'Jon, we are unable to attach our tractor beam because of the intense solar activity.
 T'JON (V.O.) / (calmly) I understand. (giving up) Thanks for trying.
 DATA / Captain, I have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter.
 PICARD / Enterprise to Sanction. We have analyzed your problem.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Great.
 DATA / Your ship's design uses an electromagnetic coil to constrict the exhaust flow. That coil is misaligned.
 PICARD / Have you the necessary tools to realign the coil?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / I don't think so.
 DATA / Captain, I believe we can provide the freighter with a temporary substitute. Ship's stores contain a coil of the proper type.
 RIKER / (to Tasha) Can we beam it over?
 TASHA / Yes.
 PICARD / Captain T'Jon, we will beam over a replacement coil.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / That's great... and that will fix us up?
 PICARD / Well, once it's installed.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Right. (a beat) ... And how do we do that?
 PICARD / What's the matter with these people? How can he be the captain of the vessel and be ignorant of its simplest functions?
 RIKER / If this weren't so serious it would make you laugh.
 PICARD / Captain T'Jon -- how long have you been in command of the freighter?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Seven years. This is my twenty-sixth voyage to Brekka.
 PICARD / And you don't know how to align a control coil?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / It's never come up.
 RIKER / Is there anyone on board who can do it?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Hold on a minute... I'll ask.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / (continuing) Sorry -- nobody here knows anything about it.
 RIKER / I'll beam over with a team.
 TASHA / Captain -- I strongly recommend against anyone from this ship beaming over. The solar interference is too great.
 WORF / The freighter has entered the planet's atmosphere. Disintegration is imminent.
 RIKER / We are running out of options.
 PICARD / (nods to Tasha and Riker) Let's get them off there.
 PICARD / Captain T'Jon. Prepare to beam over.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / If you think that's best.
 PICARD / Unless you have another option -- yes, I "think that's best."
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / (amiable) Whatever you say.
 TASHA / I can't maintain a positive lock.
 WESLEY / An unusual E-M burst. Readings off scale.
 RIKER / Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise. We are having difficulty getting a fix.
 TASHA / (to Riker) Have them go to their own Transporter Room. It will be tricky, but perhaps I can link the two transporters in series and get them over with the increased power.
 RIKER / It's worth a try. (to intercom) Captain T'Jon -- go immediately to your Transporter Room. Contact me from there.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / (still very calm) Right, Enterprise -- we'll call you from there... but, if you can't get us with your transporter, what makes you think ours will do the job?
 TASHA / I'm going to interconnect them.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / I didn't know you could do that.
 TASHA / Hurry -- we're running out of time.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / We're on the way.
 TASHA / I don't think they're going to make it.
 RIKER / Captain T'Jon doesn't seem to care one way or the other.
 TASHA / (touches the com) Worf -- how much time do we have?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / One minute, twenty-eight seconds.
 TASHA / Captain T'Jon -- are you there?
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Yeah. We're in the transporter room.
 TASHA / Great. Activate your transporter. Set coordinates nine -- seven -- zero -- three... mark two... six... eight.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Did you say... two -- eight -- six... or eight -- eight -- six.
 TASHA / (frustrated almost to the point of anger) TWO -- SIX -- EIGHT.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / Got it.
 WORF / The hull temperature of the freighter is passing three thousand degrees.
 PICARD / What's the holdup, Number One?
 RIKER / We are establishing the link now.
 T'JON'S COM VOICE / We are ready.
 TASHA / Then all six of you get on the transporter platform -- on my signal, energize.
 TASHA / (continuing; to Riker) I've got their initial transporter signal. Interlock complete. (intercom) Energize on my mark. Four -- three -- two -- one -- energize.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Did you get them off?
 RIKER / No. They stayed on the freighter -- and sent their cargo.
 PICARD / Cargo!? Are those people crazy? (a beat) What could possibly be that important?
 WORF / Sir -- the freighter is disintegrating.
 GEORDI / Captain, the freighter is entering the atmosphere. Her hull temperature is building.
 PICARD / Number One -- I don't understand these people. Their lives are in danger and they're sending over cargo?
 RIKER / Unbelievable.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We're losing the freighter. You've got to beam those people over now.
 RIKER / (to Tasha) Clear that cargo. Beam it to a hold.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (to Sanction) Freighter Sanction... this is the Enterprise, get on the transporter pad and... (to Tasha) Forget it. Just lock on to any life forms you can find and get them over.
 TASHA / Trying, sir.
 GEORDI / The freighter is going down.
 PICARD / Transporter Room! You're out of time.
 TASHA / Reading six life forms... (shakes her head) But I can't get a solid lock.
 RIKER / We've no choice. Energize.
 RIKER / You said SIX - where are... (fearing the worst) ... the other two?
 TASHA / (shakes her head) The lock didn't hold, sir.
 RIKER / Re-establish.
 TASHA / It's too late.
 PICARD / Number One!?
 RIKER / Two are lost, sir. But we saved four.
 On the transporter pad are the four humanoids: T'JON, ROMAS, and SOBI (three males) as well as LANGOR (a / female). They are instantly divided into pairs - because of the physical differences, clothing and manner.
 RIKER / I am Commander William Riker of the USS Enterprise. (solemnly) I'm sorry. We were unable to rescue the other two.
 RIKER / Were they with you... (then indicating the other pair) ... or with you?
 T'JON / (nearly frantic) With us.
 RIKER / We did everything we could, if you had come instead of the cargo, you could have all made it.
 T'JON / The cargo... Where is it?
 ROMAS / (also panicking) You did save it, didn't you?
 RIKER / (mystified) Yes, we did. It's in one of our cargo holds. You act like it's more important than your comrades.
 T'JON / May we see it?
 T'JON / Thank you. It's just we thought we had lost it.
 SOBI / (casually) Careful with your choice of words, T'Jon. It's ours, not yours.
 T'JON / (heating up) We paid a fair price for it!
 LANGOR / You offered a fair price, but we have not received it.
 ROMAS / You accepted our goods in trade!
 SOBI / Then where are they? Tell me!
 T'JON / That's not our problem!
 LANGOR / No more than the barrel is your property. It's as simple as this. The goods were never delivered; they were destroyed with your ship.
 SOBI / Hence the deal was incomplete; hence possession of the Felicium remains ours!
 ROMAS / (a plea) We need it.
 SOBI / (to Riker) Commander, I request you transport my associate -- (nods to Langor) -- and myself down to our planet, with our merchandise.
 T'JON / Yes, get them out of here! But the barrel stays.
 LANGOR / (to Sobi) There's no reasoning with you.
 SOBI / (to her) Langor, you expect too much from them. You always have and you are always disappointed. (then to T'Jon with a hard edge) You didn't pay -- so it's not yours.
 T'JON / Damn you, Sobi --
 TASHA / (drawing her phaser) Stop this! Now!
 RIKER / Security to Cargo Bay Eleven!
 TASHA / Behave yourselves, Gentlemen.
 TASHA / (re the aliens) Escort our "visitors" to the Observation Lounge.
 TASHA / (eyeing the aliens) A natural electrical charge... ?
 RIKER / Formidable.
 TASHA / Yes, and a difficult weapon to confiscate.
 T'JON / We have to resolve this. There isn't much time.
 SOBI / What can you offer?
 T'JON / Everything we had went down with the Sanction.
 SOBI / Then it is going to be difficult to accommodate you.
 GEORDI / Solar flares are increasing in magnitude, sir. Deflectors are shaky, but holding.
 PICARD / Maintain. (to Riker) And our rather combative guests, Number One?
 RIKER / Waiting for you in the Observation Lounge, sir.
 PICARD / Data, what can you tell me about the inhabitants of this system?
 DATA / Not very much, sir. The only recorded contact with the Delos system was over two hundred years ago. A scout ship reported two inhabited planets, both technologically just on the edge of acquiring space travel.
 GEORDI / Odd that in two centuries, neither civilization advanced further.
 TROI / Sir, I find it strange that none of our visitors feel much remorse about the two freighter passengers who perished... yet their barrel of cargo is a source of great anxiety to them.
 PICARD / Yes, let us pay a call and get some answers. Counselor, Number One, Mister Data...
 RIKER / Captain, may I present Sobi and Langor from the planet Brekka, which we are now orbiting. And T'Jon and Romas... from the neighboring planet, Ornara.
 PICARD / I am sorry we could not save your ship.
 T'JON / You could have repaired it.
 PICARD / Yes.
 T'JON / We have only two left. Neither works. They are critical to our survival. Could you fix them?
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / Our computer downloaded the specifications for the magnetic coils the freighters depend on, sir. Assuming the malfunction is similar... suitable replacements can be fabricated.
 PICARD / (to Data) Instruct Engineering to proceed.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 T'JON / Now, as for our cargo...
 SOBI / Our cargo, Captain.
 ROMAS / Wrong, Sobi --
 PICARD / My first officer has said ownership of the cargo is in dispute. This is a question which must be settled by whatever legal mechanisms exist between your societies.
 T'JON / Captain Picard, you don't understand. This is a matter of life and death.
 PICARD / Why is that? What is the cargo?
 T'JON / Medicine.
 PICARD / Indeed.
 ROMAS / Our home planet is in desperate need, Captain. Ornara suffers from a lethal plague.
 T'JON / The cargo you have impounded represents the only hope of life for our people.
 PICARD / Is that right?
 SOBI / Yes.
 LANGOR / You must think us heartless brutes, Captain, but look at our side of it. The plant which yields the medicine Felicium grows only in remote areas of our home planet Brekka.
 SOBI / It must be painstakingly cultivated, harvested, and purified... a complex and expensive process.
 LANGOR / That single shipment of Felicium represents an enormous investment. We can't just give it away!
 T'JON / We paid for it. (to Picard) We are asking only for what is ours.
 LANGOR / That is your viewpoint. Ours, of course, differs.
 ROMAS / You are going to hold to that position.
 SOBI / I am constrained to abide by the terms of our agreement.
 ROMAS / (with quiet intensity) Then you condemn us to death!
 T'JON / Romas --
 ROMAS / (to Sobi and Langor) You disgust me! If you saw the suffering the plague has brought, would you still be so heartless?
 ROMAS / (continuing) We are going to get to find out, when you see what the plague does to us.
 PICARD / Romas -- you and T'Jon carry the disease?
 ROMAS / (bitterly) Yes. Every Ornaran does.
 PICARD / Then you may have brought it aboard my ship! (to Riker) Was there a medical scan during transport?
 RIKER / Unverified -- the solar flares may have caused a malfunction in the biofilters --
 PICARD / Red Alert! Medical emergency -- decks twelve and thirteen. Doctor Crusher to the Observation Lounge immediately!
 SOBI / You find us well, I trust?
 BEVERLY / As far as I can tell. Your physiology is somewhat different but I detect no dangerous virus or bacteria.
 LANGOR / I assure you we are in perfect health.
 T'JON / (impatient) We're not! We need our medicine.
 SOBI / (correcting) Our medicine.
 T'JON / We paid for it -- it's ours now!
 BEVERLY / Enough!
 SOBI / (smiling) Of course you are right, Doctor. Could we leave now?
 BEVERLY / I see no reason why not. (to the security guard) Escort them to their quarters.
 LANGOR / Captain, could I talk with you please... in private.
 PICARD / Not right now.
 PICARD / What have you learned?
 BEVERLY / The Brekkians are free of infection. The Ornarans have all the symptoms of a disease -- but I can't find a cause.
 PICARD / Perhaps the transporter filtered it out when they were beamed aboard?
 BEVERLY / (shaking her head) There's no record of it. Then again, the solar flare activity may have caused a transporter malfunction.
 PICARD / Are they going to die?
 BEVERLY / The physiology is somewhat different from ours, so I need to check further, but... my instinct says no.
 PICARD / Do you think we are in danger from this plague?
 BEVERLY / Again, I don't think so, but I need more time to know for sure.
 PICARD / There are some missing pieces to the puzzle, don't you feel that too?
 BEVERLY / What's missing here is a little humanity.
 PICARD / (lightly) Are we losing our professional detachment, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Perhaps. As Captain, I think you should know that I am developing a very active dislike of the Brekkians.
 PICARD / Understandable.
 T'JON / Captain, you must give us back our cargo.
 PICARD / I can't do that.
 T'JON / Why not? It belongs to us.
 PICARD / And the Brekkians insist it is theirs.
 ROMAS / They lie!
 PICARD / Maybe so, but it's not for me to decide.
 ROMAS / (losing his composure) We need some now... NOW! I don't care if it's your 'decision' or not... get us some!
 T'JON silences Romas with a gesture; T'Jon attempts / to speak calmly.
 T'JON / Captain, what's happening to us, is happening to thousands more on Ornara. Please understand the magnitude of the problem.
 ROMAS / (angry) Your people don't need it -- (indicating the Brekkians) -- they don't need it... our people do!
 T'JON / If you don't give it to us, you will be party to murder... not only us, but an entire civilization!
 T'JON / (continuing) Sorry, I did not mean to insult you. I'm feeling very shaky.
 ROMAS / We cannot hold out much longer!
 BEVERLY / No, Captain -- I think they should have it. They believe it will help them. That in itself might control their symptoms.
 PICARD / I'll talk with the Brekkians.
 T'JON / Thank you, Captain. I appreciate anything you can do.
 SOBI / May I say, Captain, how impressed we are with your ship and its facilities.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 LANGOR / And its crew. Everyone is so efficient and professional.
 PICARD / I am glad you are comfortable. I've come to seek your agreement to an Ornaran request.
 SOBI / We cannot --
 LANGOR / (interrupting) Wait. Let the Captain speak. We want to be reasonable.
 PICARD / The Ornarans are quite ill and are insistent that they need Felicium.
 SOBI / That is not surprising.
 PICARD / Then would you object to allowing them enough Felicium for their immediate needs?
 SOBI / Captain, we Brekkians are in business -- we are not in the habit of giving away what has not been paid for.
 PICARD / You would let them die rather than share the medicine?
 LANGOR / We want to be fair, Captain. We agree to permitting them two dosages for immediate use.
 SOBI / (magnanimous) No charge.
 PICARD / I'll have our medical officer handle it.
 LANGOR / I trust you won't mind if we are present while you open the cargo, Captain.
 LANGOR / Point-zero-one milliliters is the proper individual dosage.
 PICARD / (impressed) A very potent substance.
 SOBI / We've perfected our distillation process over the years. In my grandfather's day, the same amount of Felicium would have filled five rooms this size, Captain.
 DATA / No doubt you have applied your technology from other industries to the refinement of this product.
 SOBI / We have no other industry.
 PICARD / None at all?
 LANGOR / We don't need any. The Ornarans provide us everything we need -- in exchange for this.
 DATA / Fascinating. Your society dedicated exclusively to the production of a single product.
 PICARD / A product for which you have no use for, but which the Ornarans can't live without.
 LANGOR / One of the little ironies of life, Captain.
 SOBI / But one we'd be fools not to take advantage of. It is mutually beneficial.
 LANGOR / The Ornarans provide us with the necessities of life and we provide them with the necessities of living. It is a fair exchange.
 PICARD / (interrupting) A most interesting relationship.
 BEVERLY / Excuse me... I'll take this to Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / Can I help?
 ROMAS / (to his friend) Hurry up!
 BEVERLY / You are feeling better?
 T'JON / Yes. Thank you. I'm fine now.
 PICARD / Report, Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY / I may not know Felicium's full effect on Ornaran physiology. But I know how to interpret physical reactions.
 PICARD / Are the Ornarans recovering?
 BEVERLY / Both T'Jon and Romas are fine... in fact, too fine. (a beat) Felicium is a narcotic.
 PICARD / Then T'Jon, Romas -- indeed every Ornaran --
 BEVERLY / -- is a drug addict.
 RIKER / It's a fascinating little tale we've run into of disease -- rescue -- commerce -- and interdependence between two worlds.
 PICARD / You have piqued my interest, Number One -- please continue.
 RIKER / Mister Data.
 DATA / Beginning several thousand years ago, the two worlds took different paths. Ornara became technically sophisticated, Brekka did not. Then two hundred years ago Ornara was stricken by a devastating plague.
 RIKER / Their advanced technology could offer no solution.
 DATA / Somehow, and there is limited information on this point, the cure was found in a plant which is indigenous to only Brekka, and which resisted all attempts at cultivation on Ornara.
 RIKER / In any case a trading situation quickly developed, which still exists.
 DATA / The Ornarans acquire the Felicium from the Brekkians, and in exchange, the Ornarans provide the Brekkians with foods and staples.
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / A nice arrangement for the Brekkians.
 RIKER / And for the Ornarans -- without the medicine they would all die.
 BEVERLY / No they wouldn't. Captain, here are the results of my analysis. Felicium is definitely a powerful and addictive narcotic. What's more, despite what the Ornarans have been saying, it's not a medicine. It was a medicine, and it did cure the plague, two hundred years ago.
 PICARD / And they no longer need it.
 BEVERLY / The plague is irrelevant now: it doesn't exist... and it's not going to recur.
 PICARD / The Ornarans have no medical need for Felicium.
 BEVERLY / No, but their physical and psychological need is very real.
 BEVERLY / What are you going to do?
 PICARD / Based on what we know so far... there is nothing I can do.
 BEVERLY / And you don't think drug addiction and exploitation is sufficient cause?
 PICARD / This situation has existed for a very long time. Those two societies are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship.
 BEVERLY / With one society profiting at the expense of the other.
 PICARD / That's how you see it.
 BEVERLY / I can synthesize a non-addictive substitute which will ease their withdrawal symptoms.
 PICARD / No. We can't do that either.
 BEVERLY / I know this. You can't let them have the Felicium.
 PICARD / Why? Because it goes against our moral sensibilities? Our mission is not to force Federation or Earth values on others in the galaxy.
 BEVERLY / In this case... you're wrong, Captain. One hundred percent wrong.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Captain, I am receiving a call from Ornara.
 PICARD / Patch it in here.
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / The signal's ragged, but I think I can put it on the Viewscreen.
 MARGAN / I am Margan. Are my people on board your ship?
 PICARD / Some of them, yes.
 MARGAN / May I speak with them?
 PICARD / Yes. (touching his com panel) Lieutenant Yar, have the Ornarans brought in... no, wait, I don't want them to have access to the bridge. (then, to Margan) We will contact you in a few minutes. (then to Yar) I will take this in the guest quarters.
 WESLEY / (amazed) I can understand how this could happen to the Ornarans... What I can't understand is why anyone would voluntarily become dependent upon a chemical.
 DATA / (checking readouts) Yet, the voluntary addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in many cultures.
 WESLEY / (nods) As in the twenty-first century... when Earth governments used narcotics to control the military.
 DATA / Or look at the twentieth century. The dangers of drug abuse were well known, yet their use was commonplace.
 WESLEY / Why?
 DATA / That is what I do not understand.
 TASHA / No one wants to become dependent. That happens later.
 WESLEY / But it does happen. So why do people even start?
 TASHA / Oh, lots of reasons... My home planet was a place of great poverty and violence. For some, the only escape was through drugs.
 DATA / I fail to comprehend how a chemical substance can provide an escape.
 TASHA / It doesn't. But it makes you think it does. (a beat) You have to understand -- drugs can make you feel good.
 TASHA / (continuing) They put you on top of the world. You're happy... Sure of yourself. In control. A lot of people never feel that otherwise.
 DATA / But it is artificial.
 TASHA / It doesn't feel artificial. It feels natural, good, and mind expanding. (a beat) Until the drug wears off. Then you pay the price. Once you come down, you're lower than when you started. So you take the drug again -- and it kicks you back up. But not as high this time.
 WESLEY / (catching on) So you take more.
 TASHA / But each peak gets lower and the valleys get deeper. Before you know it -- you're taking the drug not to feel good but to keep from feeling bad.
 WESLEY / And that's the trap.
 TASHA / You think the drug expands your universe -- but it actually shrinks it. Shrinks it to where you and the drug are all that's left. (MORE)
 TASHA (Cont'd) / (a beat) Pretty soon, all you care about is getting your next dosage. You'll lie, cheat, steal -- anything to get that fix.
 DATA / Certainly by then you would realize the danger.
 TASHA / That's the worst of it. You don't care. The drug is your salvation -- your survival. Nothing else is important.
 WESLEY / I guess I just don't understand.
 TASHA / Wesley, I hope you never do.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Yar, we are ready in the guest quarters.
 MARGAN / T'Jon. Have you got it?
 T'JON / Well, it's here, but...
 MARGAN / You've got to get it to us. T'Jon... please... We're dying here. You don't know... this is the worst it's ever been.
 T'JON / I'm doing everything I can. See... what happened was...
 MARGAN / (cuts him off) Stop. I can't listen. T'Jon... we need the medicine. So, many people... so much suffering. You've got to get it to us. I can't... I can't go on. Help, T'Jon... please.
 PICARD / I'm sorry.
 T'JON / Take us to our planet - leave us there with our medicine or this person dies.
 T'JON / (continuing) Don't you see -- I have no choice. We were sent to bring back the Felicium. The suffering on my planet is too great. People are dying. It doesn't matter any more whether we are entitled to the Felicium... we have to have it.
 PICARD / Let him go.
 T'JON / Take us there now -- or give us a shuttle -- but we must have the medicine... if you refuse, this person dies.
 PICARD / I will not be coerced.
 T'JON / I'll do it. I'll kill him.
 PICARD / (calmly) No you won't. You're not a killer and neither am I.
 T'JON / Help us... please... help us.
 PICARD / I'm not sure that I can.
 LANGOR / Captain Picard, we couldn't help overhearing. Could I see you for a moment?
 PICARD / Come with me, Doctor. This could be interesting.
 LANGOR / We have thought about this a great deal.
 SOBI / Both of us feel deeply about what is happening on Ornara.
 LANGOR / Although this is going to cause hardship to us and to our people, we have decided to give the Felicium to them.
 SOBI / They can pay for it when they are able.
 LANGOR / We don't want to cause any suffering.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) I wonder why I expected this.
 LANGOR / Pardon?
 PICARD / It's the other shoe.
 BEVERLY / (to Langor) The Ornarans are not aware, are they?
 LANGOR / Of what?
 BEVERLY / That the plague which nearly destroyed Ornara... infected your world as well.
 LANGOR / You don't know that for sure.
 BEVERLY / It had to.
 PICARD / But somehow, one of your ancestors realized that your desire for the drug continued after the disease had been cured. They made the connection and were able to end their addiction.
 BEVERLY / (scornful) But these same wonderful people also realized that their neighbors never found out. Their need for the drug grew to the point it is now. Your sole source of support comes from providing the narcotic.
 PICARD / And the refinement process of which you are so proud was a way to make Felicium even more addicting... and tighten your grip on the Ornarans even further.
 LANGOR / Are you going to tell them?
 PICARD / No. I can't tell them. You see, I am bound by the rules of the United Federation of Planets, which say I am not to interfere in other worlds, other cultures. To tell them any of this would be interfering and would violate the Prime Directive.
 SOBI / (suspicious) You're talking to us about it...
 PICARD / Telling you things you already know... which changes nothing.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc. I can synthesize something which will alleviate their suffering and make withdrawal painless.
 LANGOR / That won't be necessary, because if I understand the captain, he is going to allow the Ornarans to have the Felicium.
 PICARD / Yes, I am.
 BEVERLY / You can't do that. Some things go beyond words on a page. These Brekkians have knowingly enslaved others. They have caused untold suffering and hardship, just so their pitiful lives could be easier. At least don't give the Ornarans more drugs.
 PICARD / It is not for me to make any of these decisions.
 LANGOR / You are absolutely right, Captain.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, we've arrived at Ornara and assumed standard orbit.
 PICARD / (to intercom) Acknowledged. Thank you.
 PICARD / (continuing) Forgive me for doing what I must. (to T'Jon and Romas) I'm beaming you down to your world... with your Felicium.
 T'JON / Good. I knew it would work out this way.
 ROMAS / You've made the only humanitarian decision, Captain.
 SOBI / (to T'Jon) Langor and I will beam down to Ornara with you.
 LANGOR / We'll work out payment terms for the Felicium.
 T'JON / On behalf of my people, I extend thanks for your benevolent attitude.
 T'JON / (continuing) And I also thank you, Captain, for doing the right thing.
 ROMAS / Your gift of these coils will ensure that our freighters will continue to work.
 PICARD / (firmly) No.
 T'JON / (confused) No.
 PICARD / I will not supply you with spare parts for your freighters. If you want them repaired, you'll have to do that yourself.
 ROMAS / In a short time our freighters will be inoperable.
 PICARD / Quite possibly.
 T'JON / But we depend on those freighters! We must have those parts.
 SOBI / If you withhold those coils, you're disrupting the stability of both our planets --
 LANGOR / -- and interfering with a trade arrangement that has lasted for generations! What of this Prime Directive of yours?
 PICARD / Nothing in the Prime Directive compels me to help you.
 ROMAS / You're an executioner, Captain. You want our world to perish.
 PICARD / No. That's not what I want.
 T'JON / But without our freighters, there will be no more shipments of Felicium! We will die!
 BEVERLY / You must trust in yourselves. There are... other options.
 PICARD / And you must understand that my oath as a Starfleet officer gives me no choice in the matter.
 PICARD / (continuing) Transporter Room. Lock onto our guests and their cargo and beam them down to Ornara.
 T'JON / (stiffly) Captain, I hope you realize what you've done to us.
 PICARD / Of that, you can be sure. (a beat) Good luck.
 BEVERLY / When the Felicium runs out, the people of Ornara will suffer horrible withdrawal pains.
 PICARD / No doubt.
 BEVERLY / We could have made their burden easier.
 PICARD / Only in the short run. Painful as it will be, the people of Ornara -- and the people of Brekka -- must shape their own destinies.
 BEVERLY / It sounds so... heartless.
 PICARD / Doctor, it was not an easy decision.
 BEVERLY / I just hope it was the right one.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, take us out of orbit.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. Course laid in.
 PICARD / Engage.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41886.9. We are en route to Sarona 8 for much needed R and R. The entire crew is looking forward to the diversion. On a personal note, I have allowed myself the luxury of a head start.
 PICARD MOVES HIS / 
 PICARD / En garde.
 PICARD STEPS FORWARD / 
 THEIR BLADES CROSS / 
 PICARD SNAPS AND BEATS / 
 RIKER HIGH BLOCKS / 
 RIKER SCORES / 
 THEIR MASKS / 
 RIKER / I took advantage...
 PICARD / No, no. The advantage was yours, Number One. I'm out of practice... too much time on the bridge. En garde!
 PICARD REPLACES HIS MASK / 
 PICARD FAKES RIKER / 
 PICARD SCORES / 
 RIKER / Interesting move. What technique was that?
 PICARD / The technique of a desperate man. Shall we...
 PICARD AND RIKER HURRY TO / 
 PICARD / Picard to bridge. Report.
 DATA / It is not an attack that we know of, Captain. Origin unknown. Sensors did not detect the force until immediately prior to impact. Shields did not have time to respond. Damages unknown.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We're on our way, Mister Data.
 WORF / Damage reports from all decks coming in, sir.
 DATA / Injuries?
 WORF / Minor.
 DATA LOOKS AT HIS / 
 DATA / I still am unable to determine the cause of the energy force. There is nothing within a reasonable distance of this ship powerful enough to cause an impact of that magnitude.
 RIKER / Mister Data?
 DATA / Damages and injuries are minimal.
 PICARD / Where did it come from?
 DATA / I am still checking, sir.
 PICARD / Hazard a guess, Mister Data.
 DATA / It appears to originate from the Pegos Minor sector.
 PICARD / That far?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD TAKES / 
 PICARD / Lieutenant La Forge, set coordinates for that sector. Shields at full power.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. Coordinates laid in.
 WORF / Sir, I am receiving a transmission from Pegos Minor. It's an S.O.S.
 PICARD / Put it on audio, Lieutenant.
 WORF / I can't get through, Captain.
 PICARD / Turn it off. Lay in a course for those coordinates, La Forge. Warp eight.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. Plotted and laid in.
 DATA / Estimated arrival four hours, seventeen minutes, thirty-five seconds.
 RIKER / Isn't Manheim the one who was thrown out of the Institute for unauthorized experiments?
 DATA / Quite the contrary, Commander. He left of his own volition. Professor Manheim is the most highly reputed scientist within the Federation. A brilliant visionary who...
 PICARD STANDS UP / 
 PICARD / ... Who disappeared over fifteen years ago. Along with his wife, Laura.
 RIKER / Did you know him, Captain?
 PICARD / No. He was teaching at the University when I was in Paris, but I never had the pleasure. Number One, you have the Conn. Inform me half an hour before we reach the coordinates.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD LEAVES / 
 PICARD / Computer, this is Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Paris. Twenty-two years ago. A warm spring day. April ninth. Eighteen hundred hours -- three o'clock.
 EDOUARD /  / Monsieur, welcome to Cafe Des Artistes. Is this your first time in Paris?
 PICARD / No, I've been here before.
 PICARD / (continuing) That table.
 EDOUARD /  / Mais oui, we are here to please you.
 PICARD / I've been away far too long.
 PICARD APPRECIATES / 
 EDOUARD /  / Some wine, some cheese, a perfect tarte tatin...
 PICARD / I'm afraid I'm not hungry. I really came for the view.
 EDOUARD /  / Perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu?
 PICARD / Perhaps not. It was many years ago, I had a rendezvous -- I was to meet someone, a young woman, here, at this very table.
 EDOUARD /  / She did not come?
 PICARD / I don't know, actually. I've always imagined that she did.
 EDOUARD /  / You, however, did not. Trust Edouard. I will bring something special, just for you.
 FRANCINE, stands and throws some money on the table. / 
 FRANCINE / I'm not staying if all you're going to do is talk about him.
 GABRIELLE / What is this for?
 FRANCINE / My lunch. Feed it to the birds.
 FRANCINE LEAVES / 
 GABRIELLE SIGHS AND STARES / 
 GABRIELLE / He will come. He will.
 PICARD HEARS THIS / 
 PICARD / Yes, I'm sure he will.
 GABRIELLE LOOKS AT / 
 GABRIELLE / He's a military man, just like you. We're going to get married and he's going to stay here in Paris and never leave me.
 PICARD / He's stationed here?
 GABRIELLE / Not yet, but that's the way I've got it planned. Last night, well, after last night, he just couldn't leave. He couldn't.
 PICARD CANNOT BEAR / 
 PICARD / If he's as young as you are, maybe he doesn't know yet exactly what he wants to do.
 GABRIELLE / You're an important Starfleet officer -- what would you advise my lover to do -- go off and explore the galaxy or stay here and explore something which has no boundaries -- love?
 PICARD / I would tell him that he must be the person he is meant to be... and that you deserve nothing less than that.
 EDOUARD /  / Bordeaux, a very passionate year.
 PICARD / A glass for the young lady.
 GABRIELLE RISES AND MOVES / 
 GABRIELLE / Do I remind you of the girl you left behind?
 PICARD / No. Yes, you do. It's hard to say, it has been many years.
 GABRIELLE / Then you have forgotten her face.
 PICARD STARES THROUGH GABRIELLE / 
 PICARD / Not a single detail. I can see every inch of her to this day and being here -- I can feel the softness of her in the breeze, smell the fragrance of her in the flowers. I have not forgotten.
 GABRIELLE / What was her name?
 PICARD / Laura.
 PICARD / You've been at that console twice as long as you estimated.
 DATA / My estimation was incorrect, Captain.
 DATA SWIVELS IN HIS CHAIR / 
 DATA / (continuing) And I think it would be best if what I am about to tell you were also incorrect.
 PICARD / Nonsense. Out with it.
 DATA / Someone, I would assume Professor Manheim, opened up a window. A window into another dimension.
 PICARD / You don't know how?
 RIKER / You don't know what it is?
 PICARD / What came through this window?
 PICARD / (continuing) A window, that's all you know.
 DATA / Sir, the answers to your questions will be the most important scientific answers of the twenty-fourth century.
 PICARD LOOKS TO THE VIEWSCREEN / 
 PICARD / Manheim.
 GEORDI / Captain, we've reached the coordinates specified. There's nothing here.
 WORF / I am receiving new coordinates. It's a relay signal, the same source as the first one.
 PICARD / Set course for the new coordinates.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Why would someone make it this difficult to find him if he truly wants to be found?
 WORF / A failsafe, I would imagine.
 GEORDI / Captain, my sensors are picking up what appears to be a small planet.
 PICARD NODS / 
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, standard orbit. Give me a visual.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 WORF / Viewscreen on.
 WORF / There's a forcefield of some kind surrounding the planet, sir.
 PICARD / Penetrable?
 DATA / No, sir.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open, sir.
 PICARD / This is the USS Enterprise responding to your signal for help.
 LAURA (V.O.) / Help. Please help me. I don't know what to do. It's only the two of us. He's shaking. Please.
 PICARD'S FACE / 
 PICARD / Can you lock onto her coordinates?
 GEORDI / No, sir. The forcefield is preventing any kind of contact other than audio.
 PICARD / Mrs. Manheim, this is... the captain of the Enterprise. Is your husband conscious?
 LAURA (V.O.) / No. You've got to help him.
 PICARD / There's a force field surrounding your planet.
 LAURA (V.O.) / Yes. I know.
 PICARD / Good. Then you must be very brave and leave his side long enough to shut down the system that is preventing us from helping you.
 PICARD / (continuing) Good. (to crew) Lock onto their coordinates and beam them up.
 PICARD SITS IN HIS CHAIR / 
 RIKER / I'd like extra decontamination precautions, Captain.
 PICARD / Fine, Number One.
 RIKER / The professor seems to be going in and out of consciousness.
 PICARD / Well, the first time he's "in" be sure you find out what the hell he was up to down there.
 RIKER / Is anything wrong, sir?
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD LOOKS UP / 
 PICARD'S POV - LAURA / 
 LAURA STEADIES HERSELF / 
 LAURA / Jean-Luc?
 PICARD / Laura.
 BEVERLY hurriedly takes readings of the uncontrollably / shaking body of Paul Manheim.
 BEVERLY LOOKS UP / 
 BEVERLY / It's not good.
 RIKER / When will I be able to question him?
 BEVERLY / I don't know.
 PICARD AND LAURA ENTER SICKBAY / 
 LAURA / Is he dead?
 BEVERLY / No. I've sedated him.
 BEVERLY / I'll do everything I can to save him.
 RIKER / Doctor, we need to talk to this man as soon as we can.
 LAURA STARTS TO CRY / 
 BEVERLY WATCHES THIS SHOW / 
 BEVERLY / I'll let you know as soon as he regains consciousness.
 LAURA / Thank you. Thank you, all.
 PICARD STEADIES / 
 PICARD / Bridge, Picard. Status report.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Shields are holding, Captain. Ten percent loss of power. Minimal damage, all decks.
 PICARD IMPATIENTLY / 
 PICARD / We can't wait for this man to wake up to find out what's going on here. Clearly, whatever this window is, it's still open.
 RIKER / Agreed, Captain. I'll have Data start immediately on a thorough evaluation of all of Doctor Manheim's theories.
 LAURA RUSHES TO HIS / 
 BEVERLY GIVES HIM / 
 PICARD / When did this start?
 LAURA / Right before he sent out the S.O.S. -- after he -- well, he'd been in the lab for at least three days.
 PICARD AND BEVERLY / 
 PICARD / Laura, I'm afraid I need to ask you a number of questions - and time is of the essence.
 BEVERLY / You can use my office.
 BEVERLY'S EYES FOLLOW / 
 LAURA SMILES BITTERSWEETLY / 
 LAURA / This is not how I imagined it.
 PICARD / Nor I.
 LAURA / You've done well. Exactly as you'd hoped.
 PICARD STRUGGLES / 
 PICARD / Not exactly. Nothing works just as you hope... Laura, I'm sorry about your husband. (beat) I need some information from you.
 LAURA SENSES THE / 
 LAURA / I don't know what I can tell you, Jean-Luc. At best, I'm a glorified laboratory assistant. Paul's mental capabilities are so far beyond yours and mine, he couldn't discuss his work with me.
 PICARD / But you must know something of the nature of his experiments.
 LAURA SHRUGS / 
 LAURA / He lectures me, he practices on me, but he doesn't confide in me. I stopped listening long ago.
 PICARD / Why did he come here? Why Vandor?
 LAURA / He said it was because it was far enough away, no one would or could steal his theories... or stop him from trying to prove them.
 PICARD / What he was working on is unquestionably quite dangerous as well as out of control.
 LAURA STARES AT / 
 LAURA / He's a little like you, Jean-Luc. He loves, he needs the challenges of the unknown... all I do know is that he's been very close to a major breakthrough. He's been excited and agitated and working around the clock for the past few months.
 PICARD LOOKS QUESTIONINGLY / 
 PICARD / Why weren't you affected?
 LAURA / Every time he began an experiment, he insisted I stay in what he said was a protected room. I guess he was right.
 PICARD BEGINS TO PACE / 
 PICARD / Fifteen years here? By yourself?
 LAURA / There was no place left for Paul to go -- and I am his wife. (beat) Our destiny isn't always exactly what we expect. Isn't that what you just said?
 PICARD STEPS BACK / 
 PICARD / I must send a team to the planet.
 LAURA / You can't. It's protected. Paul's made sure no one can get in.
 PICARD PUTS HIS ARMS / 
 BEVERLY STRIDES INTO / 
 BEVERLY / Excuse me.
 LAURA / Is he worse?
 BEVERLY / He's resting. I'd like to have you undergo some tests as well.
 BEVERLY GESTURES TO THE / 
 BEVERLY / (continuing) He'll start them.
 LAURA / Thank you for your kindness, Doctor.
 LAURA LOOKS BACK / 
 BEVERLY UNCOMFORTABLY / 
 PICARD / She's an old friend.
 BEVERLY / I gathered that. It's her husband I'm more concerned with at the moment.
 PICARD / What's his prognosis?
 BEVERLY / So far, he's dying and there's nothing I can do about it. His entire genetic structure is altering -- constantly. I don't know how or why. I've never encountered anything like it before.
 PICARD / How long does he have?
 BEVERLY / Maybe a couple of days. It's not predictable. All I can do is attempt to maintain him until we find out what's causing the damage.
 PICARD / Can I talk to him?
 BEVERLY / You may never be able to talk to him. He may never be coherent again.
 BEVERLY STARTS BACK / 
 PICARD / Doctor.
 PICARD / (continuing) I haven't seen Mrs. Manheim since Paris.
 BEVERLY / You needn't explain, Captain.
 PICARD / It was a very long time ago.
 BEVERLY / Yes. She's a lovely woman.
 RIKER / Were you able to get any information, sir?
 PICARD SHAKES HIS / 
 PICARD / Mrs. Manheim is in the dark about her husband's work. And he may never come out of the state he's in. What have you found out?
 DATA / Sensors show there's an immense volume of energy being reflected from a small point on the planet's surface... near the main Laboratory.
 PICARD / Reflecting what?
 DATA / We do not know yet, sir. It appears to be moving from a thin beam into wider beams and back again in an unstructured manner.
 PICARD PUSHES / 
 PICARD / Is this "beam" responsible for the jolt we just felt?
 DATA / Not directly, sir. It is possible the beam is responsible for opening the "window."
 RIKER / But that's pure assumption. We still know virtually nothing about Manheim's work.
 DATA / About this particular work, sir. Professor Manheim is renowned for his work in perfecting subspace communications, and thermodynamics, but those particular achievements seem to have no bearing on what he is trying to do on Vandor.
 PICARD IS / 
 PICARD / To the point, Mister Data.
 DATA / When he disappeared fifteen years ago, he had been working on theories of non-linear time. His colleagues apparently questioned his obsession -- and his methodology.
 PICARD / How far did he get?
 DATA / No one knows. He became angry about their doubts that he could enter other dimensions. He left the Institute. That is the last anyone heard of him until now.
 RIKER / Can we deal with what's happening down there from the ship?
 DATA / Unlikely. I would need to see the Doctor's notes. And even then, his mind is of such unparalleled brilliance, I am not sure I could decipher them.
 PICARD REACTS / 
 PICARD / There is an elaborate defense system to protect his work.
 WORF STANDS TO / 
 WORF / We can get through any system.
 RIKER / It's worth a try.
 PICARD / Agreed. Take a small away team. See what you can find down there.
 RIKER GETS UP / 
 RIKER / Worf. Data.
 PICARD LOOKS AFTER / 
 RIKER / Energize.
 PICARD / I don't care if you have a signal or not -- bring them back!
 TROI SEEMS TO WILL / 
 TROI / They will return. Please, they've got to.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / I have a reading, it's not much, not complete...
 PICARD / ... Lock on, man. Beam them back!
 RIKER AND DATA / 
 PICARD AND TROI WAIT MOTIONLESS / 
 WORF REAPPEARS / 
 PICARD / Medical Emergency Team in Transporter Sixteen.
 PICARD HOLDS WORF'S / 
 PICARD / Good God, what happened out there?
 RIKER AND DATA / 
 PICARD / One at a time.
 WORF STIRS SLIGHTLY / 
 PICARD / Stop! I'll wait for Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / I'm all right!
 PICARD / I'll see you all in my Ready Room.
 PICARD / A dragon?
 WORF / Not exactly, sir, but a monster that...
 RIKER / (interrupts) ... It wasn't anything at all like that. It was beautiful -- godlike.
 DATA / It was completely logical in the most disorganized way possible. Colors, sounds, lights. Not light you see, but light you feel.
 PICARD / You each experienced something different and it affect you in dissimilar ways.
 TROI / Sir, Worf is a warrior. He probably confronted his dragon and fought with it. Professor Manheim also tried to analyze whatever it is that comes through this window. They were both struck down.
 RIKER / I experienced it.
 DATA / I observed.
 PICARD / However interesting this may be, it is not, as far as I can tell, bringing us any closer to closing that damn window.
 PICARD TURNS TO DATA / 
 PICARD / Check and re-check all the sensor readings that were taken while you were "out there."
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD TURNS TO RIKER / 
 PICARD / Number One, are you clear-headed enough to do some research?
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Good, then go over all the material that Mister Data collected on Manheim's various theories. Maybe you'll be able to see something that ties in. Something that explains the experience you just had.
 RIKER / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf... go to your quarters and rest...
 WORF / ... I feel fine, Captain.
 PICARD / That's an order. There will be plenty of "dragons" left when you awaken.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 WORF MARCHES OUT / 
 PICARD / This has nothing to do with their subconscious fears and dreams?
 TROI / I'm afraid not, sir. This is real.
 PICARD / That's what I was afraid you'd say, Counselor.
 LAURA RUSHES TO HIS SIDE / 
 LAURA / Thank God. We're on the USS Enterprise. They answered your distress signal.
 LAURA / Yes. Oh, Paul, you're going to be fine.
 BEVERLY SEES WHAT'S HAPPENING / 
 BEVERLY / Professor Manheim is conscious.
 LAURA PULLS AWAY / 
 LAURA / The Board was right. We should have stayed at the Institute.
 LAURA / What are you talking about?
 BEVERLY HEARS THIS / 
 LAURA / But, how could you know, I never told you about Jean-Luc?
 LAURA TURNS AWAY / 
 BEVERLY IS AFRAID / 
 BEVERLY / Doctor Manheim, please try to stay calm. There are many questions we need to ask you.
 PICARD BURSTS INTO / 
 PICARD / Professor Manheim.
 PICARD / We need your help. The situation is not good.
 PICARD / We intend to. What exactly were you working on when this window to another dimension was opened?
 PICARD / We are not totally without resources.
 PICARD ISN'T THREATENED / 
 DATA / Lieutenant Commander Data at your service, Professor.
 DATA / I suspected it but I could not be sure.
 DATA / We had the privilege of running into one of them when we tried to beam down.
 PICARD / What about time_gravity?
 PICARD / I'd rather hear it from you personally, a condensed version.
 PICARD WANTS TO KNOCK / 
 DATA IS TRANSFIXED / 
 PICARD / So -- this energy, directed into space, then what?
 PICARD / Fine. My scientific knowledge isn't the issue here -- yours is. You opened it. Are you brilliant enough to close it?
 DATA AND PICARD / 
 TROI / I'm sorry Captain, my powers appear to be quite useless in this particular instance. Whatever Professor Manheim is going through is to feelings what white is to color. I cannot distinguish one feeling from another. They are all there.
 PICARD / Certainly hostility.
 TROI / It would seem he has reason to feel hostile to you, sir, his wife...
 PICARD / Yes, Counselor, let's stick to the important issues. Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / Yes, sir?
 PICARD / I want every heading that Manheim gave Mister Data checked out and then rechecked. No one's beaming down to Vandor until we can be reasonably sure they'll make it through.
 WORF / Right away, sir.
 WORF AND DATA LEAVE / 
 PICARD TURNS TO RIKER / 
 PICARD / I'll be in my quarters, Number One.
 RIKER / Everything's under control, Captain.
 PICARD LOOKS AT RIKER / 
 PICARD LEAVES / 
 TROI TURNS TO RIKER / 
 TROI / He has had a great emotional shock. This, coupled with the strain of command, is wearing on him.
 RIKER / Women!
 TROI IS ANGRY / 
 RIKER SMILES THAT / 
 TROI GATHERS HER PAPERS / 
 TROI / I would think that someone who has so recently seen God would be a little more... well...
 RIKER / ... No one ever said that God didn't have a sense of humor.
 RIKER / Did you ever hear the one about...
 LAURA (O.S.) / You saved it. All these years.
 PICARD TURNS TOWARD HER / 
 PICARD / I wondered when you would come.
 PICARD'S POV - LAURA / 
 PICARD SETS THE FIGURINE / 
 PICARD / You are so beautiful, my throat feels as if it will close and I will never be able to tell you how beautiful you truly are.
 LAURA'S EYES SWIM IN TEARS / 
 LAURA / My love, why didn't you come to meet me that last day in Paris?
 PICARD CAN'T LOOK AT HER. / 
 PICARD / Fear. Fear of losing you. Fear of staying and losing myself.
 LAURA TILTS HIS / 
 LAURA / Not a day went by that I didn't look up into the sky and will you to know...
 LAURA (Cont'd) / (beat) ... to know that I loved you still. I always did and Jean-Luc, I always will.
 PICARD TENDERLY KISSES HER / 
 THEIR KISSES REKINDLE / 
 PICARD / My love. I cannot live without you.
 LAURA / I'll never leave you again.
 PICARD HOLDS LAURA / 
 THEIR EYES NEVER WAVER / 
 BEVERLY / I'm Doctor Crusher and I'm trying...
 BEVERLY / Try to rest.
 BEVERLY / I wish I could talk to you -- Professor Manheim. I bet you were really something.
 TROI QUIETLY ENTERS / 
 BEVERLY / Deanna?
 TROI / I wanted to see how he was doing.
 BEVERLY / The same. Nothing I do seems to make any difference.
 BEVERLY SMILES / 
 BEVERLY / That's not why you're here.
 TROI SHAKES / 
 TROI / I'm supposed to be the empath.
 TROI / Are you all right?
 BEVERLY / Why wouldn't I be? I've got one of the medical wonders of the galaxy dying in my Sickbay.
 TROI / That isn't what I meant.
 BEVERLY / I don't think I want to talk about what I think you mean.
 BEVERLY BUMPS INTO / 
 TROI / You're not helping the situation by pretending it doesn't exist.
 BEVERLY WHIRLS AROUND / 
 BEVERLY / I'm making it worse?
 TROI / I didn't say that. I said you're not helping it. Or yourself. Or the captain.
 BEVERLY / That's his problem.
 BEVERLY MOVES THINGS / 
 BEVERLY / All right. I'm still not sure how I feel about him. Now it looks as if I'll never know... are you happy? I said it.
 TROI / Talk to him.
 BEVERLY / No. I can't compete with a ghost from his past. No one could.
 TROI / She's not a ghost. She's here right now.
 BEVERLY / She may be in the here and now, but it's the ghost he sees. No Deanna, he'll have to work it through without my... input.
 BEVERLY / There. Now I feel better. thanks, Deanna.
 TROI STARES KNOWINGLY AFTER / 
 PICARD / How soon, Mister Data?
 DATA / I am almost through comparing the calculations, Captain.
 PICARD IS STARTLED / 
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Bridge, this is Sickbay. Doctor Manheim is awake and asking to speak with you, Captain. Alone.
 PICARD / On my way, Doctor.
 RIKER AND DATA / 
 RIKER / Can we do it?
 DATA / I believe so. But it must be soon. Sensors indicate a rapid deterioration of the atmosphere.
 RIKER LOOKS AT / 
 DATA / I cannot be more sure than that, Commander. Not until I see what is in Professor Manheim's laboratory.
 RIKER / Okay. Let's get ready. Worf.
 PICARD WALKS BRISKLY / 
 PICARD / You asked for me.
 PICARD IS FURIOUS / 
 PICARD / I did not come here to discuss her. I will not discuss her with you until your irresponsible actions are checked and until my away team is back on this ship safe and sound.
 PICARD / Then she is wrong. We are very different, you and I. For which I am grateful.
 PICARD STRIDES TOWARDS / 
 GEORDI / I have the coordinates exactly in the corridor the Professor specified.
 RIKER / We're ready.
 GEORDI / Good luck.
 RIKER / Respirators on.
 GEORDI / Shields barely holding, sir. Damage reports coming in.
 PICARD / Contact the away team!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Maintain an open frequency, Number One.
 RIKER / Frequency open, sir.
 DATA FINISHES ENTERING / 
 WORF / Look out!
 RIKER / Manheim forgot to mention that one.
 WORF / What is it?
 DATA / Hopefully, an easily deactivated alarm system.
 RIKER / More surprises.
 DATA IS ALREADY / 
 RIKER / Captain, a problem with Manheim's security. Any chance he's awake?
 PICARD / No, Commander. Doctor Crusher is under orders to inform me if the professor regains consciousness. (beat) What's the problem?
 DATA FINISHES TAKING / 
 DATA / Professor Manheim's state of consciousness is of little use to us.
 PICARD / Explain.
 DATA / It appears, sir, he was more interested in making certain his notes were destroyed than in our safety. When we came into the lab we triggered an explosive device. In less than ten minutes the lab and whoever is in it will cease to exist.
 PICARD / I'd like to wake him up myself.
 DATA / Do not bother, sir. Manheim himself could not stop this. It is deactivated by a photogenetic code. Manheim's is altered.
 RIKER / My suggestion is to continue the mission posthaste.
 PICARD / You've got seven minutes. I don't care what you've found or what you're doing, clear?
 RIKER / Yes, sir. Worf check the outer perimeter -- carefully. And Data...
 DATA IS ALREADY / 
 DATA / Truly incredible.
 GEORDI / Sir, the sensor findings from the last blast are in.
 PICARD / And?
 GEORDI / They're different from all previous waves.
 PICARD / In magnitude, in energy mass, in composition?
 GEORDI / In every way, sir. It would seem we are dealing with something that's not even remotely easy to classify. We might sit here for the next hundred years being blasted daily, and no two blasts would be the same.
 TROI / Anything could happen. We're dealing with another dimension.
 PICARD / Are you saying it could arbitrarily, or even with fine methodology, change direction and instead of blasting us, draw us in... suck us through the window?
 GEORDI / That would certainly be a viable possibility, sir. One of trillions.
 TROI / With so much to fear, there is truly nothing to do but remain calm.
 DATA CALMLY WORKS / 
 DATA / It is the only chance we have.
 RIKER / What is?
 DATA / A reversal of the same effect Doctor Manheim has programmed into the computer.
 WORF / How?
 DATA / There is no time to reprogram. You will need to physically change microchips the same time I program the correct instructions here.
 RIKER / Captain, we have a plan.
 PICARD / Proceed, and report at regular intervals.
 DATA IS UP AND OPENS / 
 DATA POINTS UP / 
 THEIR POV - UP / 
 DATA (O.S.) / Someone must climb to the top. The circuits we need to change are in that panel.
 RIKER AND WORF / 
 DATA / Whoever goes will be in more danger than falling. A great heat is generated in this chamber. Enough to disintegrate any of us in seconds.
 RIKER / What about the doors, the ones we came in? If they stay open, would the system short out? Heat of that magnitude requires a seal of some sort, doesn't it?
 DATA / We cannot do it electronically. I need to use full power to reverse the effect.
 WORF / I will keep the doors from closing.
 RIKER TAKES HIGH-TECH CLIMBING GEAR / 
 WORF READIES HIMSELF / 
 PICARD / Away team, report.
 DATA / Sir, we are executing the plan.
 RIKER CLIMBS / 
 PICARD / You've got three minutes, no more. Transporter Room, lock onto their coordinates and be ready to beam them up the instant of my command.
 DATA WAITS AT THE COMPUTER / 
 WORF LOOKS UP / 
 WORF / He's past the halfway mark.
 RIKER HANGS BREATHLESS / 
 RIKER / Captain, I need more time.
 PICARD / You haven't got it.
 RIKER PRESSES FORWARD QUICKLY / 
 WORF / (to Data) He's almost there.
 WORF PRESSES HIS MASSIVE / 
 DATA TOUCHES A BUTTON / 
 WORF STRAINS WITH EVERY CELL / 
 RIKER REACHES THE TOP / 
 RIKER / Go, Data.
 DATA BEGINS THE PROGRAM / 
 DATA / Remember Commander -- it is the blue chip you switch with the yellow chip.
 WORF STRAINS, SWEAT / 
 DATA / (continuing) Ready, five, four, three, two, one.
 RIKER SWITCHES THE CHIPS / 
 WORF EXHALES / 
 PICARD / Beam them back.
 RIKER / Did it work?
 DATA / It is well patched... Closed in this sense would be an equation...
 RIKER / Patched is good enough.
 DATA TILTS HIS / 
 DATA / By my calculation, the laboratory just disintegrated.
 BEVERLY / But this is amazing. All your readings are completely normal. There's even been a complete nerve regeneration.
 PICARD AND LAURA ENTER / 
 LAURA / Paul?
 BEVERLY / There are no residual effects.
 PICARD / I'm sure the Federation will want to help you in any way they can, as long as you are willing to now be a part of the Federation.
 PICARD / The science team will be arranged.
 PICARD WATCHING HER / 
 LAURA WALKS INTO / 
 LAURA / I hope you don't mind. I convinced the technician you wouldn't.
 PICARD TURNS TO HER / 
 LAURA / Oh, no, I won't be staying.
 PICARD / I know.
 LAURA / I wanted to say good-bye here, not in the Transporter Room.
 PICARD / You have more courage than I did.
 LAURA / More courage than a young man in first love, yes. More courage than Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the USS Enterprise -- I doubt there are many who could boast that.
 PICARD / I eat, sleep and dream your softness -- could it be enough?
 LAURA / We would have been the richest, most gloriously happy two people in all the worlds.
 PICARD WATCHES HER LEAVE / 
 PICARD / I cannot say good-bye to you.
 PICARD / Is anything wrong?
 RIKER / No, sir.
 PICARD / Then set course for Sarona Eight. As I remember we were on our way for some much needed R and R.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. Course set and laid in.
 PICARD / Warp five. Engage.
 GEORDI MAKES THE / 
 RIKER / I've only been there once, but there's this great bar -- I can't remember the name of it, they serve these blue concoctions...
 TROI / ... It's across the square from the Zanza Men's Dance Palace.
 PICARD LOOKS FORWARD / 
 PICARD / It's called the Blue Parrot Cafe -- and you're buying.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, stardate 41775.5. We are en route to the ocean world known as Pacifica...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) Our mission is routinely scientific in nature. We look forward to seeing the warm blue waters and fine white beaches that make Pacifica a treasured jewel of the galaxy.
 GEORDI / (grinning) ... So the guy staggers to his feet and goes back to the girl. She smiles, looks him right in the eye and says "Just try that in hyperspace!"
 DATA / (thoughtful) Ah, I see. So the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning in a zero gravity environment, coupled with the adverse effect it would have on the psychological well being of the average human male, is what makes this anecdote so amusing. Yes. Very humorous indeed. Hysterical, in fact.
 RIKER / What's our e.t.a. at Pacifica, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / Twenty two hours, fourteen minutes.
 RIKER / Increase to warp six.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 RIKER / (to Troi, mischievous) Think anyone'll mind if we arrive a little ahead of schedule?
 TROI / (warm smile) I know I won't. I've been looking forward to a nice swim.
 DATA / You are aware Counselor, that the Holodeck can be programed to recreate an oceanic environment.
 TROI / It's just not the same, Data. Have you ever gone for a real moonlight swim?
 DATA / (deeply puzzled) One can swim in moonlight?
 TROI / How about you, Worf?
 WORF / (shaking head) Swimming is too much like bathing.
 DATA / -- Commander Riker.
 DATA / (continuing) I am receiving a Code Forty-Seven.
 RIKER / Verify.
 DATA / (astounded) It is a Code Forty-Seven, sir. Starfleet emergency frequency.
 TROI / Code Forty-Seven... Captain's eyes only.
 RIKER / Riker on the bridge, Captain. I'm sorry to disturb you.
 PICARD / What is it, Number One?
 RIKER / An incoming message -- Code Forty Seven, sir.
 PICARD / Pipe it through.
 RIKER'S IMAGE IS instantly REPLACED BY THE official / SEAL OF STARFLEET and the United Federation of Planets. A FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE addresses Picard...
 PICARD / Understood.
 PICARD / Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / (half-whisper) Walker...
 PICARD / Too long, my friend. Why are you contacting me on this frequency?
 PICARD / Risk?!
 PICARD / I don't understand.
 PICARD / You're using a Code Forty-Seven! I have to know what this is all about.
 PICARD / For God's sake Walker, you know this is a secure channel --
 PICARD / (thinking it over) When?
 PICARD / Impossible. We're expected at Pacifica --
 PICARD / What is?
 PICARD / Walker --
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Are you familiar with Dytallix B, Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / Uh, well...
 DATA / If I may, sir? Dytallix B is one of seven uninhabited worlds mined for the Federation by the Dytallix Mining Company. I believe B is in the nearby Mira system.
 PICARD / Fine. Chart a course for it immediately, warp seven. And there will be no records or logs mentioning any aspect of this diversion.
 RIKER / Captain, they're expecting us at Pacifica. Shouldn't we contact them to let them know --
 PICARD / -- Negative, Will. Nothing goes out without specific orders from me.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Hopefully our delay will be minimal.
 DATA / I have the readout on Dytallix B, Commander.
 RIKER / On screen.
 DATA / Dytallix B is the fifth of six planets circling the red giant known as Mira.
 DATA / (continuing) One side always faces the sun -- where temperatures reach up to one hundred and eighty degrees Celsius. The mines line the temperate zone between the day and night sides, but they are long deserted.
 RIKER / Why the devil would we be going there? Are there any miners or indigenous life forms on the planet?
 DATA / I believe the answer is negative to both questions, sir. In a manner of speaking, it is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock, a useless ball of mud, a worthless chunk of --
 RIKER / Thank you, Data. I get the idea. (into com) Captain, we're approaching Dytallix B.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Very good, Number One. I'm on my way.
 WORF / Captain, sensors are detecting three Federation starships already in orbit around the planet.
 PICARD / Identify.
 WORF / Two are frigates: the Renegade commanded by Tryla Scott, and the Thomas Paine, Captain Rixx commanding.
 DATA / (studying his console) The third is just coming into range now, sir... It is an Ambassador Class heavy cruiser... The USS Horatio.
 RIKER / Horatio? (to Picard) Isn't that Walker Keel's ship?
 WORF / Attempts at communication have been ignored by all three vessels.
 PICARD / You will make no further attempts, Mister Worf. Any life-form readings on the surface, Mister Data?
 DATA / Three sir. All gathered inside what appears to be the entrance to a mining tunnel.
 PICARD / (moving toward turbolift) Very well. Relay those coordinates to the Transporter Room. I'm beaming down.
 RIKER / (a bit alarmed) Alone, Captain?
 PICARD / Alone, Number One.
 PICARD / This is some greeting, "old friend."
 PICARD / On Tau Ceti III. It was a bar -- Quite an exotic one at that. (looks at Bolian) What do I win?
 PICARD / You know full well I hadn't even met Beverly then. You introduced them.
 PICARD / (losing patience) You don't have a brother -- two sisters, Anne and Melissa. Now what the hell's this all about?!
 PICARD / Walker, what's going on?
 PICARD / I believe we've met... The Altairian conference?
 PICARD / Tryla Scott. It's said you made captain faster than anyone in Starfleet history, present company included. (pause) Are you that good?
 PICARD / Starfleet's finest. (looks around shaft) Fancy meeting you here.
 PICARD / What threat?
 PICARD / (thinking about it) No. We've been on the outer rim for awhile. Haven't had much contact with them.
 PICARD / (quietly stunned) All dead?
 PICARD / (incredulous) Targeted for what? By whom?
 PICARD / (turning, angry) You've given me nothing to believe in! Just vague talk of wild schemes. Who's behind it, and for what purpose? How are people being changed?
 PICARD / (exasperated) Walker --
 PICARD / That's sound advice at any time, Captain.
 TROI / It seems you're in turmoil.
 PICARD / Friends... close friends, are few and far between. I'm a private man, Deanna. My Starfleet duties have shielded me from social circles. My two oldest and closest friends were Jack Crusher, may he rest in peace, and Walker Keel. Until various missions split us apart, we were almost inseparable. (pause) I trust Keel completely. If he felt it necessary to violate regulations, I know he must have a good reason.
 TROI / And you are about to put your career at risk for him.
 PICARD / Isn't that what friendship's all about, Counselor?
 TROI / -- They illicitly used the emergency channel to draw you here. Then they asked you to keep secrets from your superiors. Effectively, to disobey Starfleet regulations.
 PICARD / The people involved are all of the highest caliber. If I didn't believe in their loyalty, I wouldn't have gone this far.
 TROI / Don't you think you should tell the rest of the crew?
 PICARD / No. I won't risk implicating them. Not until we have solid evidence that something really is wrong.
 PICARD / (moving to Command) Take us out of orbit, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Resume heading to Pacifica, warp factor eight.
 GEORDI / Aye sir, warp eight.
 DATA / At that speed sir, we should arrive nine point six three hours behind the original schedule.
 PICARD / Very well. Data, I have an assignment for you. One especially suited to your talents.
 DATA / Computer -- this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Access all Starfleet Command orders to starships, starbases and colonies, for the past six months.
 BEVERLY / (serious) I understand the Horatio was in orbit around Dytallix. Did you see Walker?
 PICARD / Yes. He asked me to say hello to you.
 BEVERLY / I would have liked to have seen him --
 PICARD / (stern) -- That wasn't possible, Doctor.
 WORF / (puzzled) Captain... I'm picking up an unusual disturbance in a nearby quadrant.
 GEORDI / Confirmed, sir. Sector sixty-three.
 PICARD / Specify. What kind of disturbance?
 WORF / Hard to say at this distance, Captain.
 RIKER / I suppose Pacifica can wait a little longer.
 PICARD / Yes. Let's investigate. Maintain speed and alter course accordingly.
 GEORDI / Aye sir, changing course to three-five-one mark four.
 GEORDI / Approaching Sector sixty-three, sir.
 PICARD / Slow to impulse, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Aye sir, slowing to impulse.
 WORF / Sensors beginning to pick up small objects, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / Doesn't look natural.
 PICARD / (concerned) Agreed. (to Worf) Enlarge and identify.
 WORF / (checking scanners) It looks like... debris. (looking up, surprised) From a space vessel of some kind.
 RIKER / It could be one of the ships that was orbiting Dytallix.
 GEORDI / Agreed, sir. This sector is in close proximity to that planet.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Any identifying marks, Worf?
 WORF / (checking scanners) Nothing so far... Sensors not detecting any bodies in the flotsam... but judging from the amount of wreckage...
 WORF / ... I'm sorry sir. (pause) It can only be the Horatio. She's been totally destroyed.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's personal log, stardate 41776.1. The death of my friend Walker Keel, has had a powerful impact on me. I now believe there may be a cancer growing within the ranks of Starfleet.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) I've decided to alert my executive officer to the suspicions voiced by Keel and the other two captains.
 RIKER / There is no proof of anything.
 PICARD / The last time I saw Admiral Quinn he tried to warn me of a subversion inside the Federation. Then Walker tried, and now he's dead.
 RIKER / Subversion? Personally I don't believe in conspiracy theories.
 DATA / Startling. Quite extraordinary, in fact.
 DATA / That was not a request. I was simply... talking to myself. (smiles, pleased) A human idiosyncrasy triggered by fascination with a particular set of facts. Or sometimes brought about by senility. Or, used as a means of weighing information before reaching a conclusion. Or, as a --
 DATA / Intriguing.
 PICARD / I do not think the explosion of the Horatio was an accident. It was sabotage.
 RIKER / But we can't be certain.
 DATA (O.S.) / Perhaps we can.
 DATA / My orders were to search for abnormal patterns in Starfleet's directives. I believe I have found just that.
 DATA / These are various outposts and starbases where I have detected unusual activity over the past few months.
 PICARD / What sort of activity?
 DATA / An uncustomary reshuffling of personnel, usually in the command areas. The new officers have had abnormally frequent contact with the highest levels of Starfleet Command.
 RIKER / (concerned) Why hasn't anybody noticed this before?
 DATA / The orders were given with great subtlety. To use an aphorism, Starfleet's left hand did not know what its right hand was doing.
 PICARD / Can you speculate as to the purpose of these reassignments?
 DATA / I believe it is a clandestine attempt to control vital sectors of Federation territory.
 RIKER / It could be a prelude to invasion. But who's behind it?
 DATA / There is insufficient data to make such an assesment.
 RIKER / What do you suggest we do, warp over to Starfleet headquarters and demand to know what's going on?
 DATA / Why not?!
 PICARD / Yes... (thoughtful pause) ... Why not indeed?
 PICARD / (continuing) We're talking about a threat to the entire future of the Federation. I don't think any of us can rest easy until we've gone to the source.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's personal log, supplemental. We have altered course and are traveling toward Earth. I have apprised the remaining bridge crew of our situation.
 GEORDI / Approaching Earth, sir.
 PICARD / Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Standard orbit, sir.
 PICARD / Any word from Starfleet Command, Mister Data?
 DATA / Nothing so far, sir.
 PICARD / Strange...
 DATA / I have a message coming in from Starfleet Command, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 where a trio of admirals APPEAR. SAVAR (suh-vaar) is a regal Vulcan. AARON is old and lean -- hollow cheeks and cold, piercing eyes, beneath a shock of white hair. QUINN looks much the same as he did in "Coming Of Age." / 
 PICARD / Yes. Good to see you again, Admiral.
 QUINN / (smiling) And you, Captain.
 PICARD / Yes sir, I can imagine you would be.
 PICARD / It is, sir.
 PICARD / That... is something I'd rather discuss in person, Admiral.
 RIKER / They seem normal enough.
 PICARD / On the surface. Any thoughts counselor?
 TROI / Hard to say, sir. I sense that someone is hiding something, but I can't tell who or what.
 RIKER / I can't say I'm overjoyed to see Remmick again.
 GEORDI / Considering what we've done, their response has been pretty temperate.
 WORF / I don't like it, Captain. We can't trust --
 PICARD / (smiling after a brief hesitation) We accept your gracious offer.
 PICARD / Fine.
 QUINN / I, uh, won't be able to attend the dinner I'm afraid. But I would like to see the ship and say hello again, Captain.
 PICARD / Of course. Looking forward to seeing you. Enterprise out.
 PICARD / (quietly to Riker) Quinn wants to see us alone -- at least we know he's still on our side.
 REMMICK / Are you ready to beam up to the Enterprise sir?
 QUINN / Yes, Commander, quite ready.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard, Greg. You remember Commander Riker.
 QUINN / (warmly) Yes, hello again Commander.
 PICARD / I must say, you're looking well.
 QUINN / Never felt better in my life.
 PICARD / Last time we met you told me how tired you'd been feeling.
 QUINN / (laughing) Tired of life, I was. But not anymore. I look forward to new challenges now. (pats Picard on the back) I'd sure like to see some more of the ship.
 PICARD / Remember what you told me back at Relva 7? About the threat you perceived to the very fabric of the Federation?
 QUINN / Is that why you're here? Because of what I said?
 PICARD / That's one of the reasons.
 QUINN / (grinning broadly) Jean-Luc! You took me far too literally. I was only referring to the difficulty involved in assimilating new races into the Federation.
 QUINN (O.S.) / It's an ongoing and tumultuous process that can cause stress and strain on all aspects of our alliance.
 PICARD / (quietly) I'm sorry... I must have misunderstood.
 QUINN / (boisterous) I'm the one who should be apologizing. (chuckles) If I led you down the garden path, I humbly ask forgiveness.
 PICARD / (softly, thoughtful) Of course.
 QUINN / Now gentlemen, I believe you have a dinner to attend, while I would like to freshen up a bit before looking around some more.
 RIKER / We have a guest accommodation at your disposal, sir.
 QUINN / Outstanding.
 PICARD / (still a bit dazed) I should be getting down to the planet. Commander Riker will be at your disposal to show you anything you'd like to see.
 QUINN / That's really not necessary --
 PICARD / -- I insist. (to Riker) You can join me on Earth when the admiral's tour is completed.
 QUINN / I may want to stay a while, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / (eyes narrowing) Of course, Admiral. Stay as long as you wish.
 PICARD / (adamant) That's not Gregory Quinn. He may look like him and sound like him... but it isn't him.
 RIKER / Can you be absolutely certain, sir.
 PICARD / I am certain, Number One. I want you to go back to that cabin and keep your eye on his every move. Have Beverly concoct a reason for a complete medical examination.
 RIKER / How?
 PICARD / I don't care how! Just do it! Use force if necessary.
 RIKER / He's a senior admiral.
 PICARD / (grasping Riker's shoulders) It's not him, Will. I know that now. What we need to find out is how he's been duplicated. (pause) And who or what's behind it.
 RIKER / Captain... if you're right --
 PICARD / -- I am right.
 RIKER / -- Should you be beaming down alone? Unarmed?
 PICARD / I'll take care. Find out what you can, and then join me -- in force if you believe it's warranted. (nods at Riker) Energize.
 RIKER / Good luck, sir.
 Picard MATERIALIZES into the impressive hallway. Savar and Aaron are there to greet him. LIEUTENANT COMMANDER DEXTER REMMICK stands in the background, but the hall / seems strangely empty...
 PICARD / Thank you, sir. My first officer will be joining us shortly.
 REMMICK / (soft, friendly) Under less than ideal circumstances. It is nice to see you again, Captain.
 PICARD / I'm honored. (pause) Tell me, why is it so quiet here? The last time I saw this corridor it was bustling with activity.
 REMMICK / It often is. Tonight's a quiet night.
 PICARD / I see you keep up with our duty roster.
 RIKER / Ready for your tour, Admiral?
 QUINN / Quite ready, Commander.
 RIKER / What's in the case?
 QUINN / (thoughtful) Actually... I brought this for Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd like you to see it first?
 RIKER / (slowly moving closer) What is it?
 QUINN / A form of life. Discovered quite accidentally by a survey team on a distant uncharted planet.
 RIKER / Why haven't we heard anything about that?
 QUINN / Oh, you'll be hearing more about it shortly. But first there is much scientific study to be done. After all, this is a superior lifeform.
 RIKER / Superior?
 QUINN / Totally. (voice grows hard) Now come, Riker. Take a good look.
 RIKER / I think I'll summon our science officer --
 QUINN / It won't like your science officer. It likes you. (rises, grabs Riker's arm) Now look!
 QUINN / (dark smile) Vitamins. They do wonders for the body.
 RIKER CRIES OUT -- it feels like Quinn is crushing his / arm. Unable to break free, HE RAISES HIS OTHER ARM TO STRIKE the admiral. Riker's BLOW IS BLOCKED and QUINN responds by effortlessly THROWING HIM backwards / toward the wall. The FIRST OFFICER hits it at breakneck speed and CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR, severely dazed...
 QUINN / (dry -- evil smile) Ahh, your life is so painful now. But soon you'll be one of us.
 RIKER / (pained, weak) Riker to Security. Emergency --
 QUINN'S final blow KNOCKS RIKER OUT before he can say / another word...
 PICARD / I'd like to begin the discussion of why I'm here.
 PICARD / It's interesting you mention the Horatio. That's one of the things I wanted to discuss.
 PICARD / Has the cause of her destruction been ascertained?
 QUINN / It's good that you're here. He slipped and hit his head.
 GEORDI / (into intercom) This is Lieutenant La Forge in Guest Quarter Sixteen. We have a possible medical emergency.
 QUINN / Your Doctor Crusher is most capable; I'm sure he'll be all right. Now if you'll excuse me, my time here is limited...
 QUINN / (evil smile) Come on, Klingon. It's just you and me now...
 QUINN / Do Klingons fear death as much as humans? I could snap your neck in a second, but that wouldn't be as much fun.
 QUINN GRABS WORF'S STOMACH -- his hands digging deep / into the flesh. WORF BELLOWS in pain as QUINN LIFTS HIM off the ground by his stomach muscles. The old man's strength is mind- boggling.
 WORF / Are you all right?
 GEORDI / (groaning) If I could see... I'd be seeing stars.
 WORF / Who... what is he?
 BEVERLY / Let's find out.
 BEVERLY / (disturbed) Retinal scans are an exact match ... It really is Quinn!
 GEORDI / How can that be? He picked me up like a rag doll.
 BEVERLY / I'm going to run a complete internal scan.
 GEORDI / Keep me posted, Doctor. I'll be on the bridge.
 BEVERLY / (to Worf) What is this?
 PICARD / (surprised by the question) Not nearly enough I suppose.
 REMMICK / Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is served.
 PICARD / I'd like to contact my ship. To inform Commander Riker that we're ready to sit down.
 PICARD / Picard to Riker.
 BEVERLY / Doctor Crusher here, Captain. May I speak freely?
 PICARD / (looking around) I suppose we have no choice. Where's Riker?
 BEVERLY / He was attacked by Quinn. Or what We thought was Quinn.
 PICARD / Specify, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / A parasitic being has invaded his body. It has complete control over all brain functions. It seems to breath through a small "gill" protruding through the back of Quinn's neck. Look for this, Captain. I believe it will be visible on anyone who has been compromised.
 PICARD / Any idea what it is or where it comes from?
 BEVERLY / Negative. I've never seen anything like it before.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf. If the situation is under control, we could use you on the bridge.
 BEVERLY / (looks to Worf) It's okay. He won't be waking up for a long time.
 PICARD / Continue, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / By the placement of the tendrils, the parasite appears to stimulate the vicim's adrenal glands which generate great strength and resistence to --
 PICARD / -- Spare me the medical details, Doctor. Just tell me if you can remove it.
 BEVERLY / Not without killing the patient.
 BEVERLY / You must set your phaser on kill, Captain. Stun has little effect --
 PICARD / Doctor, one does not beam into Starfleet Headquarters armed.
 REMMICK / (as he passes) Your food is getting cold, Captain.
 PICARD / About to go to dinner now, Doctor. Have Riker join me when he's available. Picard out.
 RIKER / You're not going anywhere.
 RIKER / (continuing; to Picard) You'll be one of us soon.
 RIKER / It couldn't be helped. Riker walked in on us unexpectedly.
 PICARD / (shellshocked) What exactly is your race? Where do you come from?
 RIKER / (cold) You'll understand soon, Picard.
 RIKER / (to Picard) And it is too late. For you, that is.
 PICARD / Aaron!
 RIKER / (calling out) Hold it, Aaron!
 PICARD / (to Riker) Come on!
 REMMICK / Can I help you, gentlemen?
 REMMICK / Is there any trouble? Perhaps if you'd tell me what it is --
 PICARD / -- Remmick!
 PICARD / No, Will!
 REMMICK / (calm, sincere) You don't understand.
 REMMICK / (voice distorted) We mean you no harm. We seek co-existence.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 41780.2. Admiral Quinn is expected to make a full recovery...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) There is no trace of the parasite which took control of him. We'll never know how many of these life-forms infiltrated Starfleet, but it seems they could not survive without the "mother creature" which had taken over Commander Remmick...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... Still, the haunting question remains... Who were these beings... and will we ever have to face them again?
 RIKER / (to Picard) It was Doctor Crusher's idea to simulate the blue splinter. We had to make sure it would fool everyone, including you.
 PICARD / That it did, Number One. Rest assured.
 DATA / I have attempted to trace the message Remmick was sending. I believe it was aimed at an unexplored quadrant of our galaxy.
 GEORDI / Any idea what the message was, Data?
 DATA / Well... I believe it was a beacon.
 PICARD / (half-whisper) A beacon?
 DATA / Yes, Captain. A homing beacon... sent from Earth.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, stardate 41986.0. The captain has left the ship for a conference and we are awaiting his return. It is unusual for us to be motionless, and a unique experience for everyone concerned.
 GEORDI is at Conn - WORF at Tactical - DATA at Science / One, RIKER is in the Command position. Troi is off the bridge in her office. Everyone is looking at the viewscreen.
 DATA / This is quite intriguing. It is transmitting a carrier signal on a frequency which has not been used for centuries.
 RIKER / Is there a message?
 DATA / None. Just the carrier, possibly intended for encoded computer or telemetry information.
 WORF / I have never seen a space vehicle like it.
 DATA / Strictly speaking, it is not a "space vehicle." It appears to be a satellite, similar in its rudimentary design to those which orbited Earth in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.
 RIKER / Three hundred years ago. (mostly as a joke) Then there probably aren't any life signs?
 DATA / None.
 DATA / (continuing) The power is solar... quite primitive. There is however minimum life support.
 GEORDI / I wonder how it got out here. If it was in orbit around Earth, even at maximum impulse -- and there's no way it could travel any faster, it would have taken a dozen centuries to get here.
 WORF / At its present speed and heading, the vehicle will eventually enter the Kazis Binary system and will certainly be destroyed.
 WORF / (continuing) Sir, I could attach a tractor beam and adjust its heading.
 RIKER / I think not, Mister Worf. It's just a piece of space debris. If we weren't sitting here waiting for the captain, we wouldn't have even noticed it. Leave it be. Let nature take its course. How long until Captain Picard returns?
 WORF / The last communication indicated it would be several hours.
 DATA / Commander, request permission to investigate this vehicle.
 RIKER / Why, Data? It's just a derelict.
 DATA / It is a piece of history. The opportunity to examine such an ancient vehicle does not come around very often, and as you pointed out, we do have the time.
 RIKER / All right, Data. But be ready to beam back before the captain returns.
 DATA / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Worf -- go with him.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Minimal oxygen atmosphere. (indicates) An ancient solar generator, still operating.
 WORF / Computer -- status report.
 WORF / (continuing) Computer...
 DATA / In the late twentieth century, computers were not voice activated, Worf.
 DATA / (continuing) Notice the readouts -- dials, needle machines, gauges. Remarkable what they used three centuries ago. The on-board computers have ceased functioning. I may be able to download this old style disk drive back to the Enterprise.
 WORF / It must be sealed -- probably with age. I will blast it open.
 DATA / Not necessary.
 RIKER / Data, this is Riker. What have you found?
 DATA / Very little so far.
 GEORDI / I have picked up the captain's shuttle.
 RIKER / E.T.A.?
 GEORDI / Twelve minutes, sir.
 RIKER / Alert Main Shuttle Bay.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 DATA / The seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted.
 WORF / Here's another.
 DATA / This one is empty.
 DATA / (continuing) It has been forced open and the occupant removed.
 WORF / Commander. Look at this.
 WORF / Has she been frozen for an extended journey?
 DATA / If that were the purpose, there would be evidence of a more sophisticated monitoring system. This container is designed solely for refrigeration.
 WORF / What is the destination?
 DATA / I do not believe they were going anywhere. This vehicle should still be in Earth orbit.
 WORF / There is no way it could break orbit and travel this distance on its own power. Not in three hundred years -- not in three thousand. Some intelligent lifeform must have brought it to this section of the galaxy.
 DATA / (indicating the crypts with the shriveled forms) These crypts were opened. (indicating the empty crypts) The occupants in those were taken.
 WORF / Why take some of them, destroy others, and leave her apparently untouched?
 DATA / Perhaps they learned all they could from the others. We may never know.
 GEORDI / The captain's shuttle is approaching Main Shuttle Bay.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Enterprise, this is the captain. Number One, I want to get underway as soon as the shuttle is secure.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. We will make all preparations. (to the Away Team) Commander Data, return to the Enterprise -- immediately.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / We have run into an unusual situation here. There are people on-board. Frozen.
 RIKER / Frozen. How many?
 DATA / Three. What should I do? The vehicle has suffered severe damage. Most of the systems have failed.
 RIKER / Are you recommending they be transferred to the Enterprise?
 DATA / I do not think we should leave them here. With your permission, sir, we will be returning with three containers.
 RIKER / Whatever you do, do it quickly.
 PICARD / Number One, I want a meeting on the Observation Deck. Mister La Forge, set course zero-five-eight, mark nine-seven-three.
 GEORDI / Aye -- laying in the course now. (pause) Captain, those coordinates will take us to the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / That's correct Mister La Forge, warp factor eight.
 GEORDI / Warp eight.
 PICARD / Engage. Mister La Forge, you have the bridge.
 PICARD / Two Federation outposts in Sector three-zero have been destroyed. There has been no communication with any Federation starbases in Sector three-one since stardate 41903.2.
 WORF / Romulans.
 PICARD / That is the assumption.
 RIKER / There's been no direct contact with the Romulans since the Tomed Incident.
 PICARD / The question is: Why here? Why now? What's their objective, if indeed they have one? For half a century there's barely a whisper about them and now for no apparent reason they seem to be back with a roar. Why?
 RIKER / Almost everything we know about them is based on rumor and conjecture.
 PICARD / The strategic decision is to send one ship.
 RIKER / The Enterprise.
 PICARD / Yes.
 WORF / There is a risk. We could get out there and find ourselves greatly over-matched.
 PICARD / True enough -- it is a gamble.
 19   CONTINUED: RIKER / This first encounter... coming so suddenly after all this time. There's a very good chance it's a setup.
 DATA / Perhaps the Romulans are probing. They want to see how we react.
 WORF / Captain, we should expect hostilities.
 PICARD / Prepare as always. If force is needed we will use it, but that will mean we have failed. Our goal here is to establish some kind of relations with the Romulans -- failing that -- to convince them of our resolve and to do this without resorting to force. Right now, the general feeling is that they are seeking a confrontation. They may want to test themselves in battle against a Federation starship to gauge how much we have advanced. Personally, I think it is possible they have different motives altogether based on needs which we have not identified. If that's the case... I must know it. (to Troi) Counselor -- I will need a complete profile on them.
 TROI / There is limited information, but I will prepare something.
 PICARD / Data. Extrapolate for me the logical progression of their technical advancement; specifically, but not restricted to -- weapons.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to everybody) I want this thought through completely. Anticipate, as much as you can, all the possible permutations.
 PICARD / (continuing) Computer, how long before we arrive at the Neutral Zone?
 PICARD / We will reassemble in six hours. Let's be smart. No surprises. I would much rather outthink them, than outfight them. Questions?
 GEORDI / (as he gets up) Captain. (then:) Doctor Crusher said she would like to talk with you, when you finished your meeting.
 PICARD / Thank you. (on Com) Doctor Crusher, this is the captain.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Oh, good. Captain, could you possibly join me in Sickbay?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / (continuing) I would not ask you if it wasn't important.
 PICARD / I will be right there. (to Riker) Take the Conn, Number One. I won't be long.
 PICARD / What is it, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / It's the people from the capsule.
 PICARD / Capsule? People? What people?
 BEVERLY / The people Data beamed over.
 PICARD / I wasn't aware he had.
 BEVERLY / Well, he did and they were frozen. I thawed them.
 PICARD / You what?
 BEVERLY / I didn't know what else to do. The crypts in which they had been frozen were literally falling apart. It was either that... or...
 PICARD / What's their condition?
 BEVERLY / Right now they are all sleeping. Each of them needed minor medical attention... minor "now", but "then" their conditions were obviously terminal. One had a heart problem, another had an advanced case of emphysema and extensive liver damage. But the most surprising thing, is that each of them had been frozen after they died.
 PICARD / After they died?
 BEVERLY / Exactly. Cryonics. It was a kind of fad in the late twentieth century. People feared dying. It terrified them. At the moment of death, they would be frozen, so that later... some time in the future, when presumably medical science had a cure for whatever killed them, they would be thawed back to life, healed and sent on about their business.
 PICARD / Well, for this group, apparently it worked.
 PICARD / (continuing) Lieutenant Commander Data, please report to Sickbay -- immediately.
 DATA / Permission to leave the bridge.
 RIKER / Granted.
 PICARD / I am never critical of any member of my staff being curious, but... the timing is just so...
 DATA / I could not leave them there, Captain. The condition of the vehicle was deteriorating.
 PICARD / But, Data -- they were already dead. I mean... what more could have happened to them?
 DATA / I see your point, Captain, but at the time...
 PICARD / You're right -- under the circumstances I would have done exactly the same.
 BEVERLY / When they arrived... what was I supposed to do? Not help them?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) My question is: What do we do with them now?
 PICARD / What are the options?
 DATA / We cannot go back and return them to their ship.
 BEVERLY / We can't refreeze them.
 PICARD / They are alive now, so we have to treat them as living human beings.
 BEVERLY / Alive and well, just waiting to be awakened.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I have them sedated but they should be up and about as soon as possible.
 PICARD / Well...
 PICARD / (continuing) Then, there really is no choice.
 BEVERLY / None that I can see.
 PICARD / Before you wake them, I want Security here. (touching com) Mister Worf, report to Sickbay.
 PICARD / ... Welcome to the twenty-fourth century.
 DATA / I was able to retrieve some information from the ancient disk I removed from the module's computer. Based on that...
 DATA / Her name is Clare Raymond, age thirty-five; occupation, homemaker... must be some kind of construction work.
 BEVERLY / She died of an embolism. It probably happened very suddenly, otherwise her physical condition was excellent.
 CLARE RAYMOND is handsome, not pretty. A solid, / no-nonsense person. This time she stays awake, as she takes in the room, everything and everyone in it. They move to:
 DATA / His name is Ralph Offenhouse, age sixty-three; occupation, financier.
 BEVERLY / Advanced cardiomyopathy, inoperable at the time, but easily correctable now. He must have known for some time his condition was terminal.
 RALPH OFFENHOUSE was a power broker on both coasts / who came up hard -- is used to being absolutely in charge. He too, is disoriented -- confused -- unsure. They MOVE to the last:
 DATA / Much of his file could not be retrieved. His name is L. Q. "Sonny" Clemonds. Apparently his occupation had something to do with music.
 BEVERLY / There was marked deterioration of every system in his body. Probably due to massive chemical abuse. Unbelievable.
 PICARD / That sounds like someone who hated life -- yet he had himself frozen so presumably he could go through it all again.
 BEVERLY / Fear. Too afraid to live... too scared to die.
 PICARD / Doctor, this seems to be a situation more suited to your talents. I will leave it in your hands.
 PICARD / (continuing) I'll be on the bridge.
 BEVERLY / I know you have a lot of questions, but I would like you to wait. You are feeling a certain amount of disorientation. In a little while it should pass; then we can fully discuss what has happened. Nurse Wright will furnish you with anything you need.
 RALPH / Not so fast. Is this part of the service or is it extra?
 BEVERLY / I think it would be best if...
 RALPH / I demand to know the cost of anything you do before the procedure is approved.
 BEVERLY / I have no idea what you're talking about. (then, mostly for the others) Just take it slowly. Everything is fine. Worf, would you show them to the guest quarters.
 WORF / This way.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Number One, kindly take charge of our guests until we have time to decide what we are going to do with them.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / ... and keep them out of my way.
 DATA / (requesting to join Riker) Sir?
 RIKER / I know this is all very confusing to you so I'll attempt to explain. First -- you are on the starship -- USS Enterprise.
 RALPH / American?
 RIKER / No -- we are a vessel of the United Federation of Planets. Earth is a member.
 RALPH / What year is this?
 DATA / By your calendar... two thousand three hundred sixty-four.
 RALPH / (very excited) What? (then, holding back) My heart? Is it...
 BEVERLY / It's perfectly fine. In fact, you are all now in excellent health.
 RALPH / I made it... It worked. I never believed this was...
 SONNY / (pointing to Data) What's that?
 RIKER / An android.
 SONNY / You mean a robot?
 DATA / Actually there is a distinct difference between a robot and an android.
 CLARE / And him? The one I saw before with the... head.
 BEVERLY / She means Worf.
 RIKER / Oh, he's a Klingon, and that requires a little more explanation.
 SONNY / Guys... listen. I paid some idiot a lot of money to freeze me when I died. I need to hear the words... Am I alive?
 RIKER / Oh, yes... absolutely.
 SONNY / And the liver that was about to explode in my face.
 BEVERLY / Perfectly sound.
 SONNY / Great...
 CLARE / (who has remained confused through it all) Excuse me. Would someone tell me what's going on?
 BEVERLY / Well... About three hundred and seventy years ago you died of a massive embolism.
 CLARE / I don't remember anything about it.
 BEVERLY / You and the others were frozen.
 SONNY / Cryonics -- you know... freeze you now... heal you later.
 CLARE / I've heard about it; I just never paid it much mind. How did we get here?
 DATA / Why were you in a module?
 SONNY / The whacko who sold me this scam said that by putting us in orbit there would be no chance of brown out.
 RALPH / Several cryonics companies had fallen into disrepute because of power failures which adversely affected their refrigeration system. Their stocks were severely depressed.
 SONNY / The whole deal was a long shot... but I figured... what the hell, might as well give them the dough instead of leaving it to my ex-wives. (to Data) But you know, son, I figured it was just so much hooey.
 DATA / Hooey? Accessing. (pause) Ah, as in malarkey... jive... bull... hogwash... an intentional fabrication.
 SONNY / There you go, now you got it.
 RIKER / (to Clare) If you didn't contract for this, who did?
 CLARE / It must have been Donald -- my husband. If it was new and foolish, he'd have popped for it. Well, I'll say this. It's the first thing he ever bought into that worked.
 RALPH / I, for one, never had a doubt. My stock in this company must have split a dozen times by now.
 DATA / Actually the process of cryonics was never more than a fad, and did not continue much beyond the mid-twenty-first century.
 RALPH / I need to make a phone call as soon as possible.
 RIKER / A phone call?
 RALPH / I have provided for myself. I have a substantial portfolio. It's critical I check on it. Let the bank know that I am alive and well.
 RIKER / That's ah... going to be a little difficult right at the moment.
 RALPH / Do you at least have a copy of The Wall Street Journal?
 RIKER / I think we should take the doctor's advice and go slowly. Get adjusted to your new... ah... whatever, and then we'll talk to the captain.
 TROI / As you know, there is very little available on the Romulans
 PICARD / Anything will help.
 TROI / They seem to be creatures of extremes. One moment violent beyond description, the next -- tender. They're related to the Vulcans but as each developed, their differences grew wider. They are intensely curious. Their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance. For some reason they have exhibited a fascination with humans and that fascination, more than anything else, has kept the peace. One other thing, they will not initiate. They will wait for you to commit yourself.
 PICARD / (to himself) Counterpunches... (to Troi) Thank you, Counselor. This is quite helpful.
 SONNY / I don't know about you all... but me -- I'm going to find the bar. After all of this -- I need me a drink.
 RIKER / There is nothing of that nature on board the Enterprise.
 SONNY / No bars?! Don't tell me that, son. Well, where's the restaurant? I'm so hungry.
 RIKER / We have food stations. (he indicates the computer) Simply tell the computer what you want and it will be provided.
 SONNY / Where do you eat it?
 RIKER / Why... here... or anywhere. We're not that structured.
 SONNY / Now what?
 DATA / Talk.
 SONNY / I'd like me a thick Kansas City steak - country fried potatoes -- a mess of greens -- and... Oh, hell... forget all of that. Let me have a martini - -straight up... two olives. (he winks at Data) ... for the vitamins.
 DATA / Is there something wrong?
 SONNY / Wrong? Only that your computer here fixed just about the best martini I have ever had. (with a nod to Data) I just might get to like this place. Let's see if the Braves are on. How do you turn on this here teevee?
 RIKER / Teevee?
 SONNY / Yeah, boob-tube... you know. I'd like to find out how the Braves are doin' after all this time. Probably still finding ways to lose.
 DATA / (to Riker) Oh -- I think he means television, sir.
 SONNY / Or maybe catch up on the soaps.
 DATA / (to Sonny) That particular form of entertainment did not last much beyond the year Two Thousand Forty.
 SONNY / So, what do you guys do? I mean, you don't drink -- no teevee -- kind of boring, isn't it?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Number One.
 RIKER / Riker here.
 PICARD / Would you and Mister Data report to the bridge?
 RIKER / On the way.
 RALPH / With whom were you speaking?
 RIKER / The captain.
 RALPH / Ah... good. Tell him I would like to see him as soon as it's convenient.
 CLARE / What is going to happen to us? Do we stay here with you? Do we go back to Earth?
 RIKER / That will be up to the captain.
 RALPH / Well, get him in here. I have to phone Geneva right away about my accounts. The interest alone could be enough to buy even this ship.
 SONNY / The Yankee's right. Let's get the big boy in here.
 RIKER / (smiles) I'll pass on your request. Now, if you'll excuse us.
 SONNY / Duty calls -- hey, I understand... (then, to Data) ... come back later -- you and me can find us a couple of low-mileage pit woffies, and help them build a memory.
 DATA / What is to be done with them?
 RIKER / I don't know.
 DATA / Commander. What is a "low-mileage-pit-woffie"?
 RIKER / This time you have me, Data. I haven't a clue.
 DATA / These are not like any other humans I have ever encountered. I find them fascinating.
 RIKER / From what I have already seen of our "guests", there is very little to redeem them. In fact, it makes me wonder, how our species ever survived the twenty-first century.
 PICARD / Report.
 WORF / We are six hours from the Neutral Zone. I have been unable to establish communications with any Federation colony or station in this vicinity.
 PICARD / How many outposts are there in this sector?
 WORF / Nine.
 RIKER / I think we should go on the presumption that they've all been destroyed.
 GEORDI / By the Romulans?
 RIKER / It fits their historical pattern.
 DATA / Since there has been no contact with the Romulans for fifty-three years, seven months, eighteen days, we must consider that the information we do have, is out of date.
 RIKER / The positive side of that is their information about us is also out of date. Captain, I believe that lack of information is what this is all about.
 PICARD / Continue, Number One.
 RIKER / In my opinion, the Romulans want a confrontation... specifically against us.
 PICARD / The Enterprise?
 RIKER / Not by name; but yes, against us. They know the Federation will send their best -- this will be a perfect chance for them to learn firsthand, how much we have advanced in both technology, and technique.
 PICARD / And your recommendation.
 RIKER / I don't know if I have a specific recommendation. Perhaps we should consider taking the initiative.
 WORF / I agree with Commander Riker. We may only have one opportunity; we should seize it.
 PICARD / Data.
 DATA / That strategy is built on a single premise. The hostile intent of the Romulans. If the premise is sound, so is the proposal.
 GEORDI / If their intention isn't hostile, what is it?
 RALPH'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard?
 PICARD / This is the captain, to whom am I speaking?
 RALPH'S COM VOICE / Ralph Offenhouse. Captain, I need to talk to you.
 PICARD / What's going on here, Number One? Did you give him permission to contact me?
 RIKER / No, sir. He must have seen me use the com panel.
 PICARD / Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We are in a very important conference right now and...
 RALPH'S COM VOICE / I am sick and tired of being put off by you and your staff. This is the worst run ship I have ever been on. You could take some lessons from the Q-E Two. Now that's an efficient operation.
 PICARD / Data -- identify -- what's the Q-E-Two?
 DATA / It was a passenger liner which mostly traveled Earth's Atlantic Ocean during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.
 PICARD / He's comparing the Enterprise to a cruise ship.
 RALPH'S COM VOICE / I demand you see me.
 RALPH / ... I think I have been very, very patient, especially under the circumstances and considering what I paid for this procedure, but frankly enough is enough. I demand a phone, or a radio whatever you have. I must contact my...
 RALPH / (continuing; off balance for a beat) ...lawyers.
 PICARD / I am Captain Picard.
 RALPH / Excellent.
 RALPH / (continuing) Now, we'll be able to get some things straight.
 PICARD / Indeed we will. Those com panels are for official ship business.
 RALPH / If they are so important, why don't they need an "executive key"?
 PICARD / Aboard a starship, that is not necessary. We are all capable of exercising self-control. You will refrain from using them.
 RALPH / Now just a minute.
 PICARD / We are involved in a very serious and potentially dangerous situation.
 RALPH / I'm sure that whatever it is seems very important to you. My situation is far more critical.
 PICARD / I do not think you are fully aware of your situation, or the time which has passed.
 RALPH / Believe me, I'm fully cognizant of where I am, and when. It is simply that I have more to protect than a man in your position could possibly imagine. No offense, but a military career has never been considered upwardly mobile. I must contact my lawyer.
 PICARD / Your lawyer has been dead for centuries.
 RALPH / Yes, of course I know that, but he was a full partner with a very important firm. Rest assured the firm is still operating.
 PICARD / That's what this is all about... A lot has changed in three hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of "things". We have eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We have grown out of our infancy.
 RALPH / You've got it wrong. It's never been about "possessions" - it's about power.
 PICARD / Power to do what?
 RALPH / To control your life, your destiny.
 PICARD / That kind of control is an illusion.
 RALPH / Really -- I'm here aren't I? I should be dead and I'm not. That's what money did for me. That's the kind of power I'm talking about.
 PICARD / (turning to her) What is it?
 CLARE / I don't know. It just started and I can't stop. I keep thinking about my boys.
 PICARD / Counselor Troi, report to the guest lounge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, we are approaching Science Station Delta Zero-Five.
 PICARD / Slow to impulse... I'm on my way.
 SONNY / Say, Captain -- I need to see that pretty Doctor of yours.
 PICARD / I will inform her.
 RALPH / Captain. I didn't mean to come on so strong. I've built my life on knowing what's going on. For the first time -- I'm completely out of touch -- it makes me crazy. Can you understand?
 PICARD / It's the first thing you've said that I do understand. I'll see what I can do. But please... stay off the com panel.
 PICARD / Counselor, get those people under control. We cannot afford this continuing distraction.
 TROI / Yes, sir.
 TROI / Hello -- my name is Deanna.
 CLARE / They sent you here to settle me down.
 TROI / I'm the ship's counselor and I thought you might want to talk.
 CLARE / The local shrink.
 TROI / I'm sorry, I do not know that term.
 CLARE / It doesn't matter.
 TROI / You are feeling profoundly sad.
 CLARE / Can't stop crying. I miss my sons, and then I think... I'm here, but they are gone. Donald -- he's my husband. I love that man but, good intentions aside, he'd mess up a free lunch. Why in the world he ever decided to do this...
 TROI / He must have thought you would have wanted it.
 CLARE / I can tell you exactly what happened. He couldn't think about going on alone. I died, but he couldn't face it. So he figured if he had me frozen, then in his mind I wasn't really gone. Crazy, huh? But you have to know Donald.
 CLARE / (continuing) I'm in a world of strangers. I wish I knew what happened to my children. Did they get married, did they have kids...
 TROI / Let's see if we can find out.
 TROI / (continuing) Computer - this is Counselor Troi. Request personal history on... What are their names?
 CLARE / Tommy -- he's eight, and Eddie's five.
 CLARE / They were born in Secaucus - that's in Jersey. (to Troi) Can this really work? Can this tell me what happened to them?
 TROI / There has to be a record somewhere. There is a good chance we can find it.
 CLARE / Whether we do or not, thank you for... trying. (then, to computer) Date of birth. Tommy was born February seventeenth...
 SONNY / I just got to have a little something to jump start the morning -- and a little something else to shut down the night.
 BEVERLY / You have no medical need.
 SONNY / It's not a question of "need," darlin'. It's a matter of survival.
 BEVERLY / Sorry.
 SONNY / Not to worry -- ol' Watosh will scuffle along the best way he can.
 SONNY / (continuing) How do I get a hold of the ol' boy with the marinie face?
 BEVERLY / I beg your pardon?
 SONNY / What's his name... that android fella.
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant Commander Data?
 SONNY / That's the one.
 BEVERLY / I'll let him know you want to see him.
 SONNY / Much obliged. You sure are the prettiest little doctor I ever saw.
 BEVERLY / Much obliged.
 CLARE / Amazing. It's all right there.
 TROI / Yes, ten generations of your progeny.
 CLARE / Everyone I ever knew is dead. Would you mind... I'd like to be alone.
 TROI / No, not at all.
 DATA / You asked to see me.
 SONNY / I'm about to go out of my mind for something to do. Sittin' alone drinkin' don't get it. What say you and me put together a little party.
 DATA / A celebration?
 SONNY / Naw... nothin' that fancy -- just some folks, some suds, and some sounds. Hell it ain't nothin' but somethin' to do. Whatdeya think?
 DATA / I will ask the captain.
 SONNY / Great -- you do that...
 DATA / Query. You do not seem to be having as much difficulty adjusting to your current circumstances as are the others.
 SONNY / You mean being here -- on this tub -- four hundred years from where I started? Heck -- it's the same dance, just a different tune. You think anyone 'round here's got a guitar I could borrow?
 DATA / No, but the computer can replicate such an instrument.
 SONNY / I was kind of hopin' to get one while I still remember the chords.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Commander Data -- we are approaching the Neutral Zone. Report to the bridge.
 DATA / I must leave.
 SONNY / What's this "Neutral Zone?"
 DATA / A buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.
 SONNY / Why does that make me nervous?
 DATA / I do not know.
 SONNY / We won't be inviting these Romulans to our party, will we?
 DATA / No, it would not be appropriate.
 PICARD / Captain's log, supplemental. We have arrived at the edge of the Neutral Zone. We will now have an opportunity to learn firsthand what happened to our distant outposts.
 DATA / There is nothing left of Outpost Delta Zero-Five.
 GEORDI / It must have been one hell of an explosion.
 DATA / Sensors indicate no evidence of a conventional attack.
 DATA / (continuing) There is nothing left.
 PICARD / Can you determine what happened?
 WORF / The outpost was not just destroyed, it is as though some great force just scooped it off the face of the planet.
 PICARD / Could it have been a natural phenomenon?
 DATA / Insufficient information.
 PICARD / Geordi, set a course for the next closest station.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 WESLEY and Sonny. Sonny sits picking his guitar. / Wesley sits across from him, staring.
 SONNY / I just can't believe this. When that android fella said you could duplicate this baby, I didn't dream you'd do such a bang-up job... You like country?
 WESLEY / Excuse me?
 SONNY / Picking and strummin', son. What about rock?
 WESLEY / What about rock?
 SONNY / What's the matter, kid? You look like you're staring at a ghost.
 WESLEY / Well, sir, you were dead for over three-hundred years...
 SONNY / How 'bout rhythm and blues? That comes back every decade or so.
 WESLEY / What was it like?... I mean, can you remember...
 SONNY / What? Bein' dead? Not really, but then again there wasn't a whole lot happening.
 WESLEY / Why did you do it? Was there something left undone... something you have to finish?
 SONNY / Nope. Just curiosity... Another adventure... Simply wanted to see what was going on.
 GEORDI / We are approaching Tarod Nine.
 DATA / The condition is identical, Captain.
 WORF / Everyone and everything is gone.
 RIKER / Captain, I strongly recommend that we go to Red Alert. If the Romulans have improved their cloaking device, and we'd be fools to think they haven't, we should assume a more defensive posture.
 WORF / I agree, Captain. I recommend we go immediately to battle stations.
 PICARD / I appreciate your concern and advice, but this is not the time for rash actions. We are still investigating.
 PICARD / (continuing) There are three other stations in this sector which we need to visit. Let's proceed in a calm and orderly manner.
 RIKER / If not "battle stations," may I at least bring the ship to Yellow Alert?
 PICARD / Yes, Number One. That would be prudent.
 RIKER / Thank you.
 SONNY / So, what is it that you want?
 RALPH / I've spent my career being able to tell when the other guy's mouth is dry. There is something going on. Something serious. The tension level on this ship has jumped up.
 SONNY / Even if you're right, what can we do about it? And besides, these old boys don't need us to tell them where the bear sits.
 SONNY / (continuing) Lookie here what that young fella made for me.
 CLARE / How did he do that?
 SONNY / He called it a pattern replication. It plays real good, too.
 RALPH / I'm trying to tell you that there is a situation developing on this vessel which affects us, and all you can talk about is that stupid guitar!
 SONNY / These folks don't need us swimming in their soup, so why don't you just relax and let them do their jobs?
 RALPH / That may be all right for you, but I am not willing to allow my fate to be decided by others. I at least want to know what is going on.
 SONNY / How are you planning to do that?
 RALPH / He needs help. I think he's dying.
 SONNY / What the hell are you doing?
 RALPH / I'm going to find out what's going on.
 RALPH / Ah... let's see. (to computer) Ah... I want to go to a... the... ah... (he shrugs; then to himself:) Where would the captain be?
 RALPH / Then, take me to the Main Bridge.
 WORF / Captain, my sensors indicate a disturbance. It is large and moving, but I cannot get a positive lock nor can I get it on the viewscreen.
 RIKER / Shields up.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Captain, I recommend we transfer all power to phasers, and arm the photon torpedos.
 PICARD / Wait. If that is a Romulan ship, it will read our intent. We will be forcing them to take a similar posture. We are not out here to engage in battles; we are explorers.
 RIKER / Captain, there is sufficient evidence. Outposts have been destroyed... Countless lives have been lost.
 WORF / I have a positive lock... It's disengaging its cloaking device.
 RIKER / They are vulnerable for an instant as they become visible.
 WORF / Captain, this may be our only chance.
 WORF / (continuing) I've lost them.
 PICARD / (to Data) Are your sensors picking up anything? You should be detecting a disturbance.
 DATA / Negative.
 GEORDI / We wanted to know if they have improved their cloaking device -- I guess we have our answer.
 PICARD / (to Riker) They were trying to determine our intent... They wanted to see if we would fire.
 RALPH / Who the hell are they?
 RIKER / Get that man off the bridge... now.
 RALPH / I'm not going anywhere.
 WORF / Captain, they're back.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / Amazing. I never thought I would ever see a Romulan ship -- not this close.
 GEORDI / The last encounter was decades ago and cost thousands of lives.
 RALPH / (awed) I can believe that.
 PICARD / Stay calm, everyone.
 WORF / Captain, these are Romulans -- they are without honor. They killed my parents in an attack on Khitomer at a time when they were supposed to be our allies. They believe humans and Klingons are a waste of skin, so inferior as to be unworthy of any consideration.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, keep your emotions under control. Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 DATA / Sensors indicate all of their systems are armed.
 PICARD / But they have not fired.
 PICARD / (continuing) Let's try them again.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies are still open.
 PICARD / Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / You have crossed the Neutral Zone. This is Federation territory.
 THEI / It was necessary.
 PICARD / It could be viewed as an act of aggression.
 THEI / If our intent was aggression, you would not now be here.
 THEI / Destroyed in the exact same manner as your own.
 WORF / (to Picard) What right did they have to enter Federation space?
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf's question is valid.
 THEI / Even to ask such a question implies that we need permission; we do not.
 PICARD / Do you think we attacked your outposts?
 PICARD / Who is responsible?
 RALPH / They haven't a clue.
 RALPH / (continuing) They're hoping you know, but they're too arrogant to ask.
 RIKER / You're out of line, Mister.
 PICARD / Yes, but correct in his assessment.
 PICARD / I would like to offer a proposal.
 THEI / (with a smile) An alliance? Between the Romulans and the Federation?
 PICARD / Nothing so grandiose -- just this. Cooperation... whoever or whatever did this is more powerful than either of us.
 THEI / Agreed.
 THEI / On this one issue, and only if it is convenient and something we consider appropriate at the time.
 PICARD / We have made some progress in our relations... let's not ruin that with unnecessary posturing.
 PICARD / I think our lives just became a lot more complicated.
 PICARD / Get him off my bridge.
 TROI / I have found something.
 TROI / (continuing) I have been able to locate a family living outside of Indianapolis. The man's name is Thomas Raymond.
 CLARE / That's my son's name. My son's name is Tommy.
 TROI / Computer -- let us see Thomas Raymond.
 CLARE / Oh, my God... It's Donald... that's my husband.
 TROI / Actually, it's your great, great, great, great, great grandson.
 CLARE / He's the spitting image.
 TROI / I have his address. When you get back to Earth, you could go and see him.
 CLARE / But... I will still be out of time. A relic.
 TROI / Perhaps. But it's a place to start. He is after all, family.
 CLARE / There's no denying that.
 PICARD / Here is what I propose. You can't remain on the Enterprise. We have arranged to rendezvous with the USS Charleston, bound for Earth. You will be delivered there.
 RALPH / And then what will happen to us? There's no trace of my money -- my office is gone -- what will I do? How will I live?
 PICARD / (amused) This is the twenty-fourth century. Those material needs no longer exist.
 RALPH / Then what's the challenge?
 PICARD / To improve yourself... enrich yourself. Enjoy it, Mister Offenhouse.
 SONNY / Well, one good thing -- since everybody's forgotten everything I ever did... it'll all be brand spankin' new. Hell, I'll be a bigger hit than I ever was.
 PICARD / Perhaps so, anything is possible.
 SONNY / (to Data) What say, son -- you'd make a hell of a sideman.
 DATA / That offer does present a certain fascination.
 GEORDI / I have plotted a course to intercept the Charleston, sir, but they have informed me that they will be making an extended stop at Arloff Nine.
 PICARD / Your point, Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / At warp eight, we could have our guests at Starbase Thirty-Nine Sierra in five days. It would cut months off their journey.
 PICARD / They will benefit from the extended time. It will allow them to acclimate before arriving at Earth.
 RIKER / It's a pity we can't take them ourselves. Having them on board has been like a visit from the past.
 PICARD / That would take us in the wrong direction. Our mission is to go forward and it has just begun. Set velocity at warp six, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir... warp six.
 PICARD / There is still much to do... and still so much to learn. (pause) Mister La Forge... Engage.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies opened.
 RIKER / Repulse, this is the Enterprise. We are getting underway.
 RIKER / And to you.
 WESLEY / The Shuttle Bay is secure.
 RIKER / Thank you Mister Crusher. Make all preparations to get underway.
 GEORDI / We will construct this large enclosure on Cargo Deck Five.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / The transfer is complete. Doctor Pulaski is being shown to her quarters. We are ready to get underway.
 PICARD / Very good. Take a look at the containment module our new chief engineer has designed.
 RIKER / "Chief engineer," that has a nice ring to it.
 GEORDI / It does to me. (then to business) Each will have total atmospheric control... temperature, radiation, light, humidity, plus electrical spectrums.
 RIKER / And these are put into the large containment area?
 GEORDI / Yes, these modules will keep the specimens alive -- the large containment area will keep us alive. Now, I have to go and replicate this five hundred and twelve times. This will mean it will be necessary to divert power from the warp engines to the replicator.
 PICARD / How long will we be on impulse power?
 GEORDI / For a few hours, but it can't be helped.
 RIKER / When we leave 'aucdet Nine - I'm going to want all the power you can slam into those warp engines.
 GEORDI / You'll have it.
 PICARD / I will relieve you at zero three zero zero.
 RIKER / Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher -- set course for 'aucdet Nine.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir. Course for 'aucdet Nine has been input.
 RIKER / Maximum impulse velocity.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Engage.
 DATA / Engineering -- this is Science One. I just observed what appeared to be a random energy transference.
 GEORDI / Where?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Aft. Outboard of the port nacelle.
 GEORDI / Hold on -- I'll check.
 GEORDI / No -- I show nothing here, Data.
 RIKER / Problem, Commander?
 DATA / Possibly. An unexplained power fluctuation.
 RIKER / Let me know if it reoccurs.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1. There has been an outbreak of a yet unclassified Plasma Plague in the densely populated Rachelis system. We are on an emergency run to a Federation Research station on 'aucdet Nine, where specimens of Plasma Plague are kept. We will then transport that deadly cargo to Science Station Tango Sierra, where hopefully an antidote can be manufactured. Every hour we delay, thousands die.
 GEORDI / How's it going?
 PICARD / Number One.
 RIKER / Lieutenant La Forge says we will be able to engage the warp drive within the hour.
 PICARD / Mister Data, when we receive a complete list of all the specimens we will be carrying, I want you and Doctor Pulaski to go through it... by the way. Where is our new doctor? Has she reported in?
 RIKER / Not yet.
 PICARD / Sickbay, this is the captain.
 PICARD / Is Doctor Pulaski there?
 PICARD / What?! (surprised, then annoyed) A few hours on board and she's already found Ten-Forward.
 RIKER / I'll go and get her.
 PICARD / No, Number One. I'll go.
 WORF / Not the best way to meet your new captain.
 WESLEY / Hello, Captain.
 PICARD / (a greeting) Ensign Crusher.
 PICARD / I'm sorry this mission will delay your reunion with your mother.
 WESLEY / It's all right. I can use the time to finish some projects.
 PICARD / (dismissive) We shouldn't be more than a week or so.
 WESLEY / It is going to be hard to leave the Enterprise...
 PICARD / Mixed feelings for all of us.
 PICARD / (continuing) It's always difficult leaving any ship, as it was for your mother when she left to become head of Starfleet Medical. But going from one assignment to another is part of the life which you are choosing.
 WESLEY / Yes, but this isn't "any" ship.
 PICARD / Truly.
 PICARD / (greets her) Guinan.
 PICARD / Where's Doctor Pulaski?
 PICARD / Doctor Katherine Pulaski?
 PICARD / Doctor -- protocol on your last assignment might have been lax, but here on the Enterprise...
 PICARD / (he touches his communicator) Lieutenant La Forge, status report.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / The containment area is completed, the last of the modules are being inserted.
 PICARD / Take us to warp six as soon as possible.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 PICARD / This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski. We will handle the formal introduction later.
 PICARD / (continuing) Counselor Deanna Troi is pregnant.
 RIKER / A baby!
 RIKER / (continuing) This is a surprise.
 TROI / More so for me.
 RIKER / What?
 RIKER / I do not mean to be indelicate, but... (pause) ... who's the father?
 TROI / Last night, while I slept... something... which I can only describe it as a presence, entered my body.
 PICARD / A life-form of unknown origin and intent is breeding right now inside Counselor Troi. Our purpose here is to determine what is to be done about this very "unusual" situation. Discussion.
 RIKER / Let me get this straight -- Deanna was impregnated by... by what? (to Pulaski) Doctor, what do your tests show? Is it a humanoid? An alien?
 RIKER / Exactly the same as Deanna!
 RIKER / I don't think this is a random occurrence. There is a purpose here -- a reason. What, I don't know.
 WORF / Captain, obviously the pregnancy must be terminated.
 RIKER / Why?
 WORF / For the safety of the ship and crew.
 RIKER / Worf, you can't assume its intent is belligerent.
 WORF / That is my safest assumption.
 DATA / Captain, this is a life-form. Not to allow it to develop naturally would deny us the opportunity to study it.
 WORF / If the fetus is aborted, laboratory analysis is still possible.
 RIKER / Is there any health risk to Counselor Troi if the fetus is aborted?
 PICARD / Doctor, is that your recommendation?
 TROI / Captain, do whatever you feel is necessary to protect the ship and the crew... but know this. I am going to have this baby.
 PICARD / I believe that ends the discussion.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We have finally arrived at 'aucdet Nine. We will pick up the specimens of Plasma Plague and transport them to Rachelis.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) It is only because so many lives are at stake that I am willing to put this ship and crew at such great risk.
 PICARD / How are you feeling?
 TROI / I should be feeling uncomfortable with all the changes in my body... but, I'm not. I feel fine -- better than fine. Wonderful.
 RIKER / Standard orbit.
 WESLEY / Standard orbit, aye.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / 'Aucdet Nine, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / Excuse me, to whom am I speaking?
 PICARD / Are the specimens ready for transfer?
 PICARD / I appreciate your caution -- in the same vein, I need a complete, detailed manifest of everything which you intend to bring on board my ship.
 PICARD / (to Data) Download the inventory and go through it with Doctor Pulaski. (to Riker) Number One, arrange to have Hester Dealt transported up.
 TROI / Captain, I'm suddenly feeling a little tired. I'll be in my quarters if you need me.
 TROI / It won't be long now. Soon you'll arrive and so many questions will be answered.
 GEORDI / I just followed your instructions.
 GEORDI / I wanted to be sure they wouldn't get out.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / How's it coming, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / It will be another couple of hours, Commander.
 GEORDI / (then to Hester Dealt) Oh, yes. I understand. So, you go over it as many times as you want.
 PICARD (V.O.) / It's been fourteen hours since we arrived at 'aucdet Nine. Hester Dealt is making final selections of the specimens we will carry. Meanwhile, we continue to receive desperate pleas from the Rachelis System.
 DATA / Captain, the final manifest has been received.
 PICARD / At last. Review it with Doctor Pulaski. I want both of you to be completely familiar with it.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 TROI / Data -- help me get to Sickbay.
 TROI / It's time.
 DATA / Worf -- assemble your security team in Sickbay.
 DATA / Yes -- captain's orders.
 TROI / Yes, and strange to think my child is the cause.
 TROI / Yes, whatever his beginnings, that's what he's become.
 They enter and Pulaski leads Troi to the bed. Her MEDICAL ASSISTANTS move to prepare for the delivery. / Data comes up behind them.
 TROI / Very close together.
 TROI / Difficult under the circumstances.
 DATA / Perhaps I could serve in that capacity. I can quickly review the procedures I will be required to execute.
 TROI / Doctor. I think Commander Data will do nicely.
 TROI / There is nothing specific you have to do, Data, you just have to be with me.
 DATA / This is very interesting to me. Although I understand in technical terms how life is formed, there is still a part of the process which eludes my understanding. I began my existence as an adult. I have no memory -- no cognizance of conception, birth, childhood, so to be allowed to witness this event is...
 TROI / It's happening.
 DATA / (alarmed) Doctor!
 TROI / I have felt no pain.
 TROI / No... none at all.
 TROI / Not according to my mother.
 DATA / It was remarkable. Thank you for allowing me to participate.
 TROI / Ian Andrew, after my father.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Counselor, my best wishes to you and your son.
 TROI / Thank you, sir.
 TROI / (continuing) Have you been here all along?
 RIKER / Yes. (then just for her) He's beautiful, Deanna... just like his mother. (to Worf) I don't think you are going to be needed here, Lieutenant.
 TROI / Fine. Absolutely wonderful and thank you, Doctor... for everything.
 PICARD / Welcome to the bridge, Doctor. How's Counselor Troi? Did she have a good night?
 PICARD / I'm not sure of your point.
 PICARD / (to Data) How long before we are ready to begin the transfer?
 DATA / Two hours, nineteen minutes.
 PICARD / (he stands) You have the Conn, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Doctor, you would accompany me, please. I think it's time I paid my respects.
 TROI / Come in.
 PICARD / I wanted to come by and see how you were and have a look at your...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... baby! My goodness.
 PICARD / (continuing) How old is he?
 PICARD / Yes, but...
 TROI / Ian, say hello to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / You mean he can talk?
 PICARD / Hello, Ian.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are faced with two major problems: Troi's child and the deadly cargo we are about to load, which is so desperately needed in the Rachelis system. In the hours since his birth, Troi's baby has continued to age and now appears, physically and mentally, to be a child of eight. And still there is no indication as to who he is, or why he is here.
 RIKER / Sickbay, this is the bridge. We are ready to begin loading.
 DATA / (he corrects her) Data.
 DATA / My name. It is pronounced Data.
 DATA / You called me Data.
 DATA / One is my name and the other is not.
 DATA / It indicates a genetically engineered biological life-form.
 DATA / Query... "eager beaver?"
 PICARD / Picard here.
 PICARD / Enlighten me.
 PICARD / I understand, Doctor. Do you have a recommendation?
 PICARD / Thank you, Doctor. Commander Data, if you have completed your review, you are needed in Transporter Room Three.
 DATA / Yes, sir. (to Pulaski) Excuse me, Doctor.
 TROI / Ian!
 TROI / Come on, sweetheart, time to go.
 TROI / I thought you would. Thank Miss Gladstone for having you, and let's go get you something to eat.
 TROI / (also to the teacher) Thank you.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / The transporter is not making a positive lock.
 DATA / The built-in inhibitor is restricting onloading of life-forms known to be hazardous to the occupants of this ship. Have you attempted override?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / I don't have the authority.
 DATA / Computer, recognize -- Lieutenant Commander N-F-N, N-M-I, Data.
 DATA / Initiate override protocol.
 DATA / Acknowledged. On my authority -- begin override.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Cargo Deck Five. We will commence transport on your command.
 GEORDI / Transporter Three -- we are ready to receive.
 GEORDI / (to Data) Data, the first batch is in place. Ready for the next.
 RIKER / Inform me when loading is complete and the cargo secure.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 TROI / We're doing fine. I was just going to give Ian his supper.
 PICARD / No, Ian, but thank you for the invitation.
 TROI / They had a litter today in the nursery.
 PICARD / No, I have never played with puppies.
 PICARD. / Perhaps later.
 TROI / Is it better now, sweetheart?
 PICARD / Yes, for the experience.
 PICARD / Ian, could you tell us why you are here?
 PICARD / No, I mean... why you are here on this ship?
 TROI / Ian, the captain wants to know if you are ready to tell us why you came here.
 TROI / The answer is within him. When his cognitive powers develop sufficiently, he will be able to articulate it.
 PICARD / I hope he will tell us soon.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain to the bridge.
 PICARD / I'm on my way, Number One. (to Troi) Keep me apprised of his progress, Counselor.
 RIKER / The cargo has been loaded and is secure.
 PICARD / Take us out of orbit, Number One -- then set a course for Rachelis -- warp nine.
 WESLEY / No. I just wanted to stand here.
 WESLEY / Yes.
 WESLEY / No. Nothing thank you.
 WESLEY / Yes.
 WESLEY / Over there is the Lorenze cluster, and there Arneb and there Epsilon Indi.
 WESLEY / It will still be there.
 WESLEY / No -- nothing. That's the third time you've asked me.
 WESLEY / I try to.
 WESLEY / Sometimes. Sometimes you have to consider others more than yourself.
 GEORDI / What is it?
 GEORDI / Where?
 GEORDI / (touches his communicator) Bridge, this is Cargo Deck Five.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes, Lieutenant La Forge.
 GEORDI / There is a malfunction in the containment area.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / How serious?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. For reasons as yet unknown, one of the specimens of Plasma Plague is growing.
 GEORDI / (touches his communicator) Captain, the power to the containment grid must have somehow been affected when we increased to warp velocity.
 PICARD / I don't see how that would be possible.
 GEORDI / I don't either, but if we could return to impulse, we would know for sure.
 PICARD / Impulse velocity.
 PICARD / Report, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / There's no change. It wasn't the warp drive.
 RIKER / Permission to leave the bridge.
 PICARD / Granted.
 RIKER / Commander Data, you're with me.
 PICARD / Doctor Pulaski.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We are having some difficulties on Cargo Deck Five -- your presence is requested.
 WESLEY / You never talk about yourself.
 WESLEY / People say you are very old...
 WESLEY / ... and that you knew Captain Picard when he was on the Stargazer.
 WESLEY / Everyone is very curious about you.
 WESLEY / About where you come from.
 WESLEY / I heard that you're from Nova Kron and that...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Mister Crusher, report to the bridge.
 WESLEY / I've got to go.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Thank you.
 WESLEY / I didn't mean the souffle, I meant for... well... the rest. Thanks.
 PICARD / Take the Conn, Mister Crusher.
 PICARD / (continuing) On this course -- increase velocity to warp nine.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir. Warp nine.
 RIKER / Why that module and not the others?
 DATA / Computer, run diagnostic on module L-seven-three.
 GEORDI / (reading it off) Temperature -- as set -- minus ninety-seven degrees. Humidity -- twelve percent. Lumins -- zero. Electromagnetic containment integrity... Everything right down the line... exactly as it should be.
 DATA / Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer -- query. Is growth actually occurring?
 RIKER / One of the specimens is growing.
 RIKER / Data, prepare to jettison that module.
 RIKER / Commander, your attitude tells me that however bad I think this is... it's worse.
 RIKER / Go on.
 GEORDI / It can't break through this.
 RIKER / (touches his communicator) Captain. We may not be able to get control of this situation. I recommend making arrangements to transfer all non-essential personnel to the saucer section. If we lose containment we should be prepared to separate.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Make it so.
 RIKER / Why didn't you catch it before?
 DATA / A subspace phase inverter.
 GEORDI / We don't have one.
 DATA / Certain cyanoacrylates.
 TROI / Yes. I feel it as well, but don't you worry.
 TROI / What?
 TROI / You?
 TROI / What are you saying?
 TROI / Leave? (senses what he is about to do) You are going to die. No. No, you can't.
 TROI / (continuing; she touches her communicator) Sickbay, this is Counselor Troi, I need the doctor in my quarters... right now. (then she lifts Ian to her) No... Ian... No.
 TROI / It's Ian. Please... please hurry.
 TROI / (continuing) Save him, you must save him.
 TROI / No.
 DATA / The child is the source of the unusual radiation.
 TROI / He said he's the reason the ship is in danger.
 DATA / That analysis is correct.
 TROI / Oh, please. Please save him.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / (excited -- relieved) Captain. The containment field has stabilized.
 PICARD / Thank you, Lieutenant.
 TROI / Then Ian was right. He was the cause.
 PICARD / Apparently so.
 TROI / He is a life-force entity... as we passed each other in space he was curious and wanted to know about us, and he thought the best way to learn was to go through the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that way to understand us.
 TROI / (continuing) Captain, he never meant any harm.
 RIKER / There was a moment when you smiled.
 TROI / (she smiles again) He said thank you. (she pauses) I told him we will miss him -- and I will.
 PICARD / Standard station approach, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Standard approach, aye.
 PICARD / Transporter Room Three, this is the captain. We have arrived. Let's make this transfer with all deliberate speed, and get on about our business.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / I will be glad to be relieved of this cargo.
 PICARD / You have the bridge, Number One.
 RIKER / Yes sir.
 WESLEY / Captain.
 PICARD / Yes Ensign?
 WESLEY / Could I see you when you have a moment?
 PICARD / In my Ready Room when your duties permit.
 WESLEY / Thank you, sir.
 GEORDI / Good luck.
 GEORDI / (touches his communicator) Data, you can lock on to the first group and begin transporting on my mark.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Yes, Ensign.
 WESLEY / (hesitant) Captain... I have thought about this a lot. I want to remain on the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Oh. Have you discussed this with your mother?
 WESLEY / No, before I do that, I wanted your permission to stay.
 PICARD / Wes, it's a little more complicated than that.
 WESLEY / Captain, for right now... this is where I want to be. This is where I feel I belong.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain -- transfer complete. We are ready to leave orbit.
 PICARD / Make it so, Number One. (then to Wesley) Return to your position.
 RIKER / All stations secure.
 PICARD / Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher and lay in a course for the Morgana Quadrant.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (loud enough for everyone to hear) Mister Crusher has requested to remain on the Enterprise.
 RIKER / I'm not surprised. How did you respond?
 PICARD / I haven't as yet, Number One. I don't think it's my decision alone. His remaining will cause difficulties for us all.
 RIKER / Yes, indeed. With his mother not around, who will see to his studies?
 PICARD / Exactly. That duty would fall to Commander Data.
 RIKER / And, who'll tuck him in at night?
 WESLEY / Come on, Commander.
 WORF / I will accept that responsibility.
 TROI / Well, we know he'll get his sleep.
 PICARD / Then, Number One, that leaves you the task of guiding young Mister Crusher through his most hazardous journey -- from youth to man. Are you willing to serve?
 RIKER / Difficult question...
 RIKER / (continuing) ... Yes, I think I can do that.
 PICARD / All right then. Mister Crusher, communicate with your mother at Starfleet Medical headquarters. Give her my regards and tell her you have my permission to remain on board the Enterprise.
 PICARD / (continuing) But, that I will abide by her wishes.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir... thank you sir... I just know she'll agree.
 PICARD / Now -- if you have course and speed laid in.
 WESLEY / (back to duty) Yes sir, they are.
 PICARD / Then, Mister Crusher -- engage.
 TROI / You're worried.
 PICARD / With reason.
 TROI / About Worf, or about Commander Riker?
 PICARD / Both. (pauses) I think perhaps it is best to be ignorant of certain elements of the Klingon psyche.
 WORF touches RIKER's shoulder, signals him to move to / the right. Riker moves off. Worf pauses a beat, then slips away to the left.
 RIKER / Above, look out!
 RIKER / It's over.
 RIKER / The exercise is over.
 RIKER / At ease, Lieutenant!
 RIKER / Exit Holodeck.
 RIKER / (continuing) You do this every day?
 WORF / No -- usually my calisthenics are more... (he searches for the right word, then settles for) ... intense, but those sessions are too personal to be shared.
 RIKER / (dryly) I'll bet they are.
 WORF (O.S.) / Computer. Program complete -- save.
 WORF / (continuing) Coming Commander?
 RIKER / Right behind you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42193.6. We are on a long reach toward the Morgana Quadrant, a section of the galaxy which has yet to be visited by a manned Federation vessel. We are using the time to further detail the charts of this region.
 DATA / There it is again. An area of "blackness."
 RIKER / It appears, then disappears, then reappears. There is no predictable pattern -- no sequence.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / There it is.
 PICARD / I can't see anything. Magnify section two-eight-five.
 WESLEY / There -- it looks like a "hole" in space.
 PICARD / We're acquainted with the "wormhole" phenomenon. This appears quite different.
 PICARD / What do sensors indicate?
 DATA / Nothing.
 RIKER / Nothing?
 PICARD / I'm sure you must mean it's empty of matter, Mister Data. There is always some energy form at work...
 DATA / Sir, our sensors are showing that to be an absence of everything. It is a void without matter or energy of any kind.
 RIKER / Yet, this "hole" has a form, Data. It has height, width...
 DATA / Perhaps. Perhaps not.
 PICARD / (to Data) That is hardly a scientific observation, Commander.
 DATA / Sir, the most elementary and valuable statement in science... the beginning of wisdom... is: "I do not know." (indicates viewscreen) I do not know what that is.
 WESLEY / Captain, if this were any ordinary kind of hole in space... (indicates) ... wouldn't we be able to see what's behind it?
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / I can feel nothing from it, sir, if that's what you're asking.
 RIKER / Data -- is there any record of any occurrence even vaguely similar to this?
 PICARD / "Similar" in even the slightest way.
 DATA / Accessing. (he pauses a moment) Negative. There is no record of any Federation vessel encountering anything remotely like this.
 PICARD / I believe we have time for a closer look, Number One.
 RIKER / Concur. (to Wesley) Ensign, slow to one-half impulse. Adjust course to intercept this... this whatever it is.
 PICARD / Scanning and recording as we go.
 WESLEY / Changing course to intercept in... in twelve minutes, sir.
 PICARD / Let's send a probe into it.
 RIKER / Worf, prepare a scanner probe. Let's see what's in there.
 PICARD / (to Wesley) Close enough, Ensign. Hold this position.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir. Holding this position.
 RIKER / You may launch the probe when ready, Mister Worf.
 DATA / All the probe's systems are functioning perfectly.
 WORF / It's gone.
 PICARD / What happened, Data?
 DATA / Unknown.
 WORF / (to Picard) Recommend we go to a Yellow Alert, sir.
 PICARD / (puzzled) Why?
 WORF / (hesitates, then) Sorry, sir, it's...
 PICARD / Explain.
 PICARD / (continuing) This starship operates best, Mister Worf, when we all know what is on each other's minds.
 WORF / (uncomfortably) My thoughts... were of an old Klingon legend of... of a gigantic black space creature which was said to devour entire vessels...
 RIKER / (genuinely surprised) Devours vessels?
 WORF / Sorry, Commander. I agree that these are thoughts hardly worthy of a trained and practical security officer.
 PICARD / Launch another probe, Mister Worf. This time a Class One with full sensor array.
 WORF / Launching, sir.
 RIKER / Happened even more quickly.
 WORF / Recommend we fire a photon torpedo, Captain.
 PICARD / (eyes Worf, then) Negative.
 WESLEY / Captain, based on where the probes disappeared... I have been able to plot the outer boundaries. I could move in closer.
 PICARD / Take us in, Mister Crusher. Thrusters only.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / Still no readings of any kind, sir.
 PICARD / Number One?
 RIKER / I'll agree with Worf at this point, sir. Let's be careful.
 RIKER / What's happened?
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / Whatever it was... or whatever it is... we seem to be inside of it.
 RIKER / Didn't that happen a bit suddenly, sir?
 PICARD / All stations, report!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. While exploring a strange area in space without any form of matter or energy...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... a total void, we have unexpectedly seemed to enter it. Apparently we moved past its mysterious outer boundary.
 RIKER / All stations have reported, Captain. There seems to be no immediate threat to our ship or crew.
 PICARD / In which case, let's hold position for awhile, Number One. This is worth studying.
 RIKER / Incredible. It's like looking off into... infinity, sir. (turns to Picard) Remember the course in ancient history at Starfleet Academy? Back to the time when men still believed the Earth was flat?
 PICARD / (smiles) And that the sun revolved around the Earth...
 RIKER / And if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean it would fall off the edge of the world...
 PICARD / "Beyond this place there be dragons."
 RIKER / Data -- how long to complete your scans? Let's not stay any longer than we have to.
 WESLEY / Captain, we have no communications outside of the void.
 WORF / Confirm! We are now receiving no signals of any kind.
 PICARD / Hello, Doctor. You've been briefed on what's happened?
 PICARD / I wish I could say I did. (to Data) Increase magnification by ten.
 PICARD / (continuing) By one hundred!
 PICARD / Commander Data knows precisely what he is doing.
 PICARD / Engineering!
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Engineering, aye.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, are your systems functioning?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. Wherever we are, sir, it seems to have no effect on any Engineering function.
 PICARD / Thank you, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / Difficult to make a judgment based on the absence of information.
 PICARD / Speculate.
 DATA / The obvious hypothesis is equivocal. This void has a total lack of dimension. Therefore by any accepted standard it does not exist, yet being within it denies that conclusion.
 RIKER / Then maybe we've moved into another dimension?
 DATA / Could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself?
 PICARD / For a later discussion. It's time we got on with our mission, Number One. Starfleet can send out a science vessel to investigate further. Let's move back out of this.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. (to Wesley) Reverse our direction and set a course for the Cornelian star system. Warp two.
 WESLEY / Reversing direction, sir. (adjusts controls) Course laid in.
 RIKER / Engage.
 RIKER / (to Wesley) Our engines have engaged, haven't they, Ensign?
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / Everything all right up there, Captain?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Are the engines operating normally, Engineer?
 GEORDI / Everything looks fine here, sir.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We're increasing to warp four, Engineer.
 GEORDI / We now show warp four, Captain.
 PICARD / We should be seeing stars by now, Data. How far have we come?
 DATA / Inertial guidance shows seven parsecs traveled, Captain.
 PICARD / Ensign Crusher?
 WESLEY / Confirm, sir. Exactly what my readings say.
 GEORDI / Engineering, transfer to bridge.
 GEORDI / (continuing) What's happening, sir? I thought we should have broken clear.
 RIKER / We should have. We're on a reverse course.
 PICARD / Full stop, helm.
 WESLEY / Full stop, sir.
 PICARD / According to this we're well past the point we entered the void.
 DATA / Except that we are still in it, sir.
 DATA / Captain... if we dropped a stationary beacon and navigated straight away from it, we would have a fixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance.
 PICARD / Make it so, Data. Lock onto the beacon, and keep it dead astern.
 DATA / The beacon is in place, Captain.
 PICARD / Dead ahead. Impulse power.
 DATA / The beacon is falling astern.
 PICARD / Engineering, report.
 GEORDI / All systems normal, sir.
 PICARD / Prepare to increase to warp two.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Captain, we are receiving a signal from dead ahead.
 DATA / We are closing on the new signal, Captain.
 PICARD / Identify.
 DATA / Captain, it is the stationary beacon we just released.
 RIKER / We must have come full circle, sir.
 WESLEY / We couldn't have, sir. I've shown us steadily moving away from that beacon.
 PICARD / All stop; hold position again.
 RIKER / (indicating the viewscreen) Look.
 WORF / Captain, sensors indicate a disturbance in sector one-zero- eight. Possibly a vessel.
 PICARD / Perhaps some answers at last. On screen.
 WORF / The ship is equipped with a cloaking device.
 RIKER / Romulan!
 WORF / It's closing.
 RIKER / Shields up. Go to Red Alert!
 WORF / It's uncloaking.
 RIKER / Arm your photon torpedoes, Mister Worf.
 PICARD / Hold for my orders.
 WESLEY / There!
 WORF / Direct hits, sir. Our shields are weakening.
 PICARD / Warn them we'll return fire.
 WORF / Transmitting.
 WORF / (continuing) They've armed another full spread, sir.
 PICARD / Fire torpedoes.
 PICARD / That was too easy.
 RIKER / Yes.
 DATA / Captain, sensors can locate no debris from the Romulan ship.
 WORF / Captain, there is another vessel approaching -- sector zero-nine- one, mark, two-six.
 PICARD / Specifics.
 WORF / On screen.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / It's a Federation ship. (reading the number) N-C-C... one-three-oh-five dash E. It is the USS Yamato, our sister ship.
 WESLEY / The Yamato is nowhere near this quadrant.
 PICARD / Open a hailing frequency, Data....
 DATA / This is the USS Enterprise to... USS Yamato. Respond, please...
 DATA / (continuing) This is the USS Enterprise calling USS Yamato. Please respond on this frequency.
 DATA / (continuing) No response, Captain.
 PICARD / Make a full scan.
 DATA / Life support system -- engineering and propulsion all seem functional. (turns; reacts at a reading) But there are no life signs over there, sir.
 PICARD / Can we be getting a false reading, Data?
 DATA / Since we know nothing at all about these circumstances, that is... at least, conceivable, sir.
 RIKER / (to Picard) You look doubtful, sir.
 PICARD / I'm not anything right now, Number One. I'm just a man looking for answers.
 GEORDI / (to Data; quietly) Like the rat said -- "Keep the cheese, I just want out of the trap."
 RIKER / Captain, request permission to board the Yamato with an away team. There might be something onboard -- in the logs -- which will at least tell us what happened.
 PICARD / Granted. Minimum complement.
 RIKER / Worf. You're with me.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We remain like a fly in amber trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel which appears to be the USS Yamato. All its systems are shown as functioning, yet it seems devoid of life. Commander Riker is leading an away team -- hopefully the answer lies over there.
 RIKER / Do you have a lock on that other ship?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Aye, sir. No problems at all.
 RIKER / Can you put us on the bridge?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Anywhere you say, Commander.
 WORF / I am acquainted with the Yamato, Commander. Recommend the Aft Station of their bridge. When in doubt, surprise them.
 RIKER / Them? Who's them?
 WORF / Whoever may be there.
 RIKER / Sensors show no life signs.
 WORF / Still, the tactic is sound.
 RIKER / Agreed. (to Transporter Chief) Aft Station.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Phasers on stun, Lieutenant Worf.
 RIKER / (continuing; to Transporter Chief) Energize.
 RIKER / (the obvious) This isn't the bridge.
 RIKER / No -- don't fire.
 WORF / I heard you screaming. I was coming to help.
 RIKER / Help me? But I heard you cry out.
 RIKER / (touches his communicator) Transporter Chief, where do you show us over here?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / We show... as approximately...
 RIKER / Captain, do you read me?...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / ... having difficulties...
 PICARD / Number One, come in!
 PICARD / (continuing) Transporter Room, this is the captain. We are out of contact with the away team. Beam them back, immediately.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / I have lost the lock on them.
 WORF / Nothing on my communicator, sir.
 WORF / (continuing) Computer, on.
 RIKER / (looks around) Let's find a turbolift to the bridge.
 PICARD / Transporter Room -- have you been able to establish a lock?
 PICARD / Initiate full check -- all systems.
 GEORDI / Engineering section, report. What is our situation?
 RIKER / This isn't a Federation ship. The walls are not tritanium... close, but it's a material beyond our technology. (he then leads the way to the turbolift) Let's get to the bridge. Somewhere there must be an answer to all of this.
 RIKER / Wait -- if you go through there... where will you be?
 WORF / On the bridge.
 RIKER / But we are on the bridge.
 WORF / Should I continue?
 RIKER / Yes -- move out. Let's see what happens.
 WORF / Is it the same bridge?
 RIKER / ... Or did we just step from one bridge to another bridge?
 DATA / Captain! I have a star fix.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WESLEY / It's an opening, sir.
 DATA / Confirm, navigation is possible.
 WESLEY / Should I set a course?
 PICARD / Transporter Room. Do you have a fix on the away team?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Negative.
 WORF (O.S.) / Commander.
 WORF / (to himself) At ease, Lieutenant! At EASE!
 DATA / The star fix is fading.
 PICARD / Haskell, lock on to the Yamato with the tractor beam. We leave together.
 HASKELL manipulates some controls. / 
 HASKELL / I can't make the lock.
 DATA / Captain. The star fix is fading.
 PICARD / Let it go, Data.
 HASKELL / But, sir, we can get out.
 PICARD / Let it go.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Bridge, I've re-established contact with the away team.
 WESLEY / (indicating Main Viewer) The Yamato's beginning to fade out, Captain.
 RIKER / Come in, come in Enterprise.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Hold position, away team. I've got you. We are bringing you home!
 PICARD / Transporter Room, hurry!
 WESLEY / Captain, it's almost gone.
 RIKER / What the hell's going on?
 PICARD / Are you all right, Number One?
 RIKER / Yes, but I've had it. Let's put all this technology and computers to work -- figure out what's going on -- and get the hell out of here.
 RIKER / (angry) A ship that was almost the Yamato, existing in a "hole in space," no crew aboard -- what's the purpose?
 DATA / Add to it an attack by a nonexistent Romulan vessel, it does suggest an interesting question: "Was our away team even over there?"
 RIKER / If we weren't over there, where the hell were we?
 HASKELL / Captain, I have re-established the star fix.
 RIKER / Great.
 RIKER / (to Wesley) Set course -- velocity -- warp two.
 WESLEY / Course and speed set.
 PICARD / Engage.
 DATA / I have lost contact.
 PICARD / What?
 HASKELL / The star fix is gone.
 DATA / Sir, it is not in the same sector. But another opening has appeared.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Set a course for those stars. Warp six.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir -- warp six.
 DATA / I have lost the signal.
 RIKER / Damn it.
 PICARD / All stop.
 DATA / Captain...
 PICARD / I know Data, I can see it.
 RIKER / This game is now wearing very thin.
 PICARD / Hold this position. (to Troi) Counselor, you have said you sensed no intelligence behind all of this. You haven't changed in that belief?
 TROI / I'm not so certain of that now, Captain. I do sense something unusual about all this...
 PICARD / Perhaps a different level of consciousness?
 TROI / An intelligence so vast it eluded me? Yes, perhaps.
 TROI / (quietly) Exactly!
 PICARD / Explain.
 PICARD / Are you suggesting we're in some kind of laboratory?
 WESLEY / The opening seems closer, Captain.
 PICARD / We're finished with being led about this way.
 RIKER / Agreed, Captain. Hold present position.
 TROI / Good. Don't satisfy its curiosity.
 NAGILUM / Why are you so alarmed when I've gone to such trouble to look just like you?
 RIKER / Return to your position, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Sir... ?
 DATA / Captain, sensors show nothing out there. Absolutely nothing.
 GEORDI / (half to self) It's a damned ugly nothing.
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. (firmer now) ... representing a Federation of planets in this part of the galaxy. (waits) Can you identify whoever or whatever you are?
 NAGILUM / NAGILUM! / 
 GEORDI / (to Data; quietly) Speaks right out for something your sensors say isn't there, Data.
 PICARD / We've still no idea of what you represent.
 NAGILUM / "Data."
 DATA / Nagilum?
 NAGILUM / You are of different construction than the others. Interesting.
 NAGILUM / (continuing) Picard... Riker... Geordi... Wesley...
 NAGILUM / (continuing) What are you? Your construction also differs.
 DATA / Perhaps referring to your gender.
 NAGILUM / I understand. The masculine and the feminine.
 PICARD / It is the way in which we propagate our species.
 NAGILUM / Please demonstrate how this is accomplished.
 PICARD / Whatever you are, your actions are not welcome.
 WORF / Let me put up the shields, sir.
 DATA / Our sensors do not show anything there, Worf.
 NAGILUM / Your life-form surprises me more and more. Is it also true that you have only a limited existence? (waits, then) Answer!
 PICARD / What information do you want? I don't understand the question.
 NAGILUM / You exist -- and then you cease to exist. Your minds call it "death."
 NAGILUM / (continuing) How interesting.
 WORF / Sickbay?
 PICARD / We cannot allow you to do that! We'll fight you...
 NAGILUM / (interrupting; VOICE BOOMING) To understand death, I must amass information on every aspect of it, every kind of dying. The experiments shouldn't take more than a third of your crew, maybe half.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42194.7. It is obvious that whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of life-form. How do we fight something that both is...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... and is not there?
 TROI / I can sense this much. We are unimportant to it.
 WORF / In a battle for survival, Captain, thirty to fifty percent casualties...
 WORF / ... But within acceptable limits.
 RIKER / This is not a battle, Lieutenant.
 TROI / A "laboratory experiment" would be the closest comparison.
 PICARD / Is there any reason for not believing this Nagilum?
 TROI / No.
 DATA / All evidence indicates he is willing and able to do what he proposes.
 PICARD / Agreed. Under the circumstances -- there is only one decision. I will not stand by and watch while half of my crew is slaughtered.
 DATA / Sir... I do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it.
 PICARD / No. But I can control it.
 PICARD / By destroying the Enterprise.
 RIKER / At least it's better than standing by helplessly and dying.
 WORF / I will be at my station, Captain.
 PICARD / Initiate auto-destruct sequence.
 RIKER / I do. Initiate auto-destruct sequence.
 PICARD / Stand by. (turns to Riker) Interesting question. How long to prepare to die?
 RIKER / Which is the least painful to our crew? Move to it quickly? Or take time to prepare for it thoroughly?
 RIKER) / (continuing) Hell, twenty minutes sounds like a nice round figure. Can we do that?
 PICARD / The latest program allows it.
 PICARD) / (continuing) Initiate auto-destruct in twenty minutes.
 PICARD / Come.
 TROI / Our destroying ourselves won't change its mind. I could feel that.
 PICARD / (somewhat surprised) You didn't mention you were that certain.
 TROI / I was wrong not to tell you, Captain. And your decision may also be wrong.
 PICARD / Yes? Come in, please.
 DATA / I have a question, sir. (sits) What is death?
 PICARD / You've picked probably the most difficult of all questions, Data.
 PICARD / (continuing) Some explain it by inventing gods wearing their own form... and argue that the purpose of the entire universe is to maintain themselves in their present form in an Earth-like garden which will give them pleasure through all eternity. And at the other extreme, assuming that is an "extreme," are those who prefer the idea of our blinking into nothingness with all our experiences, hopes and dreams only an illusion.
 DATA / Which do you believe?
 PICARD / Considering the marvelous complexity of our universe, its clockwork perfection, its balances of this against that... matter, energy, gravitation, time, dimension, pattern, I believe our existence must mean more than a meaningless illusion. I prefer to believe that my and your existence goes beyond Euclidian and other "practical" measuring systems... and that, in ways we cannot yet fathom, our existence is part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality.
 TROI / We should not let ourselves die, Jean-Luc!
 DATA / I agree with her, Captain.
 TROI / If only half of us live, I prefer to take my chances on being one that does.
 GEORDI / Yes. It's wrong of you to force us into this...
 DATA / It is wrong...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Yes, this is very wrong. None of you should be reacting like this.
 PICARD / Computer, locate Commander Data.
 PICARD / It's not going to work, Nagilum.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Captain, we are clear. We are out of the void.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / It's gone, Captain -- we can abort the auto-destruct.
 PICARD / Hold, Number One.
 RIKER / But...
 PICARD / Hold.
 DATA / Captain, we are clear of the void. You may stop the auto-destruct.
 PICARD / Data, on any heading -- warp six -- now!
 RIKER / Captain.
 PICARD / I don't believe it, Number One. It could still be part of the illusion. Data, report.
 DATA / All navigational systems confirm -- we are at warp six -- on course...
 DATA / ... to the Morgana Quadrant.
 PICARD / Troi?
 TROI / It's gone, Captain. I no longer sense its presence.
 PICARD / Abort auto-destruct sequence.
 RIKER / (relieved) Yes! Absolutely! I do indeed concur! Wholeheartedly!
 PICARD / A simple "yes" would have been sufficient, Number One.
 RIKER / I didn't want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding.
 GEORDI / He sure held that bluff to the last second.
 RIKER / (laughs) What bluff?
 PICARD / Well, Nagilum... I hope you got what you needed.
 NAGILUM / You have provided me with much more than I needed...
 PICARD / Why did you release us? You could have seen how we faced death.
 NAGILUM / It wasn't necessary. I have learned all I needed to know. Would you like me to share some of my conclusions?
 PICARD / I'm not interested.
 NAGILUM / Of course you are. You are too inquisitive not to want to know. (he pauses) You seem to find no tranquility in anything. You struggle against the inevitable. You thrive on conflict. You are selfish, yet you value loyalty. You are rash, quick to judge, slow to change. It's amazing you've survived. Be that as it may -- as species, we have no common ground. You are too aggressive. Too hostile. Too militant.
 PICARD / During this period, you too have been evaluated. It would seem we have at least one thing in common.
 NAGILUM / Oh?
 PICARD / Curiosity.
 NAGILUM / The point is well taken, Captain. Perhaps that is a trait we share.
 PICARD / Then perhaps we'll meet again. But next time, it will be out here among the stars.
 PICARD / Put us back on course, at warp three.
 WESLEY / Warp three, sir...
 RIKER / And Ensign -- let's give any holes a wide berth.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42486.3. We have arrived on station at coordinates -- three-six-two- nine-mark-five-eight-four, three days early for our rendezvous with USS Victory. There is nothing to do now, but hold this position and wait.
 ASSISTANT ENGINEER / Yes, Commander?
 DATA / Is there a problem? Chief Engineer La Forge called for me. "Urgent!"
 ASSISTANT ENGINEER / Oh, of course. (indicates) He's over there with the Victory.
 DATA / I just had a strange conversation with your assistant. Although it is three days until we rendezvous with Starship Victory, she...
 GEORDI / (grins; overlapping) She believes it has already arrived. (indicates) But not the starship, my friend. The original!
 GEORDI / This is my gift to Starship Victory's Captain Zimbata.
 DATA / Ah, most unusual.
 GEORDI / I served as an ensign under him. (indicates model) I wish he'd been in command of this Victory. Wind and sail, that's the proper way to move a ship.
 DATA / But your Starfleet specialty, my friend, is antimatter power, dilithium regulators...
 GEORDI / Which is exactly why this fascinates me. Data, it's human nature to love what we don't have. Simpler days! (indicates model) While stringing this rigging, I was dreaming of sail handling and...
 DATA / This is not a computer simulation?
 GEORDI / Data, the entire point of something like this is to hand make it.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Just as you have used Old England in a hobby of your own.
 DATA / Geordi... your message said "urgent."
 GEORDI / And it is, my friend. While we wait to rendezvous with Victory, we have time for me to be Watson.
 GEORDI / (continuing) More properly, your Watson.
 DATA / My Watson?
 GEORDI / You've seen my dream adventure... now let me share in one of yours.
 DATA / Ah, yes. Yes, my dear colleague, that does seem only fair.
 GEORDI / I'll be gone awhile, Clancy. See that no one touches this!
 ASSISTANT ENGINEER / Aye, sir. And where can I reach you?
 DATA / He can be reached at 221B Baker Street.
 ASSISTANT ENGINEER / Sir?
 DATA / Computer -- select at random a mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, where I will play Sherlock Holmes and Lieutenant La Forge will be Doctor Watson.
 DATA / Excellent.
 GEORDI / Look at all of the detail... and everything here has some significance?
 DATA / Holmes collected nothing -- neither trinkets nor thoughts which were not specifically significant to him.
 GEORDI / This?
 DATA / The emerald tie pin presented to Holmes by Queen Victoria after he solved the theft of the Bruce-Partington plans.
 DATA / (continuing) A copy of Whitaker's Almanack which provided Holmes the key to the secret code in "The Valley of Fear."
 DATA / (continuing) The snuff box of Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein.
 GEORDI / All right -- you solve the cases and get the gifts, what do I do?
 DATA / Primarily as Doctor Watson, you keep a written record of everything I do for later publication.
 DATA / And the famous Holmes violin. He purchased this in a pawn shop in Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five shillings, which he considered a very good investment.
 GEORDI / In the hands of some, the violin is a wondrous thing, equally capable of stirring the soul to the heights of bliss as to the depths of despair...
 GEORDI / Incredible, Data! How can you play it like that?
 DATA / Merely throwing myself into the part, Watson.
 GEORDI / In the masterful grasp of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the violin ceases to be a musical instrument at all and becomes...
 DATA / Watson! We are about to have guests.
 DATA / (continuing) Answer it, Watson -- let's not keep the good inspector waiting.
 GEORDI / Inspector who?
 DATA / Why Lestrade of course.
 DATA / Then may I say your perturbation becomes you, Inspector Lestrade, whilst simultaneously affording me yet another chance to serve Queen and country.
 GEORDI / (with a little laugh) Data, is that the way Holmes really talked?
 DATA / Absolutely.
 GEORDI / Damn! (to Data) Haven't they invented electric lights by now?
 DATA / Watson, please! (to Lestrade) Pray go on, Inspector.
 DATA / I believe, Inspector, that you will find that this emissary here works not for but against the King of Bohemia, and that photograph of the king and his ex-mistress is to be used as blackmail. Further, upon deeper reflection, you will deduce, as did I, that...
 GEORDI / (in disgust) Computer, freeze program. Exit!
 DATA / Where are you going?
 GEORDI / I'm done.
 DATA / But I was just about to reveal that the "sir" is in fact a "madame," and that...
 GEORDI / Forget it, Data.
 GEORDI / What was the point to going onto the Holodeck?
 DATA / To solve a Sherlock Holmes mystery.
 GEORDI / Exactly, but, you've got them all memorized. The first time someone opens their mouth, you've got it solved. So, there's really no mystery. If there's no mystery... there's no game... no game... no fun.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm not angry with you, Data, really... It's just that... we go to all the trouble to arrange time to come down to the Holodeck, to get the proper wardrobe, to get into character, and, boom, it barely gets started and you jump to the end. See, I was looking forward to the chase.
 DATA / Then I should have extended the sequence of events.
 GEORDI / I'm not getting through. The fun of the program is the attempt to solve a mystery.
 DATA / That is exactly what we were doing.
 DATA / Am I so different from you, Doctor? Can you cease thinking on command?
 GEORDI / She's right, Data. You always know the answer.
 DATA / Are you suggesting that there is some value in losing?
 GEORDI / I don't know about that. Deductive reasoning is Data's strength.
 GEORDI / I disagree -- totally.
 GEORDI / You're being unfair.
 DATA / I have read them all.
 GEORDI / Maybe the computer could create one in the style of Holmes... where you wouldn't know the outcome.
 DATA / (to Pulaski) I accept your challenge, Doctor.
 GEORDI / Good for you, Data.
 DATA / We will return to the Holodeck and I will dare it to defeat me, and you Madam are invited to be a witness.
 GEORDI / Believe me, you'd feel out of place without them... Just wait 'til you see our Holodeck, you'll swear you've actually been sent back to nineteenth century England.
 DATA / The Victorians believed that any form of nudity was immoral... In fact, they not only covered up all people from head to toe, but they even went so far as to put skirts and cuffs and sleeves on the arms and legs of furniture. (finishes inputting) I have instructed the computer to give us a Sherlock Holmes-type problem, but not one specifically written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
 GEORDI / So this will be something new, something created by the computer?
 DATA / Exactly. (now eyes Pulaski) Will that be sufficient, Doctor?
 GEORDI / Your first visit to the Holodeck, Doctor?
 DATA / This is no larger than the Holodeck, of course. So the computer adjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the Holodeck walls...
 GEORDI / But with the image so perfect you'd have to touch the wall to know it was there. And the computer fools you in other ways. (Watson's accent) I say, Holmes, where shall we head -- the theatre? Rule's? Or perhaps a concert?
 DATA / No. It is a ruse. This way.
 GEORDI / But, Data, what's over here?
 DATA / The running man was a hoax. The real crime is here. And the intended victim -- is...
 DATA / ... that man. Mr. Jabez Wilson. Employee of the Red-Headed League, dupe of a gang of criminals.
 DATA / I saw the plaque - "The Home of the Red-Headed League"... and this rope dangling from the vent, which enabled me to deduce that Mr. Jabez Wilson is coming here to meet a most distasteful and untimely demise. From this...
 DATA / Reasoning from the general to the specific -- is that not the very definition of deduction? Is that not the way Sherlock Holmes worked?
 GEORDI / We will just see whose circuits short out, Doctor.
 GEORDI / Computer! Arch!
 GEORDI / Computer, override previous programming. All right, now a program that definitely challenges Data.
 GEORDI / (thinks; then) Computer, in the Holmesian style, create a mystery to confound Data with an opponent who has the ability to defeat him.
 GEORDI / The computer wants to know how far to take the game.
 GEORDI / No, the parameters will be whatever is necessary to accomplish the directive. (turns to computer) Create an adversary capable of defeating Data.
 C22INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE INCLUDING WORF AND RIKER (B.G.) / 
 WORF / What was that?
 RIKER / Lieutenant?
 WORF / An odd surge of power, sir. (rechecking console) It's gone now.
 DATA / No thank you.
 GEORDI / Data -- I mean... Holmes old boy, what are we looking for?
 DATA / For whatever finds us, dear Watson.
 DATA / (as Holmes) She has been abducted.
 GEORDI / (as Geordi) I think she's hiding. She's going to lead you on a wild goose chase and then recount the story to everyone between here and Alpha Centauri.
 DATA / Watson -- a trail...
 DATA / Leading to the alley... (then in Holmesian fashion, he continues) The doctor has been carried off by two men. One is tall -- a seaman. The other is shorter, left handed, and employed in a laboratory.
 GEORDI / Left handed? And works in a lab? How do you know that?
 DATA / One set of footfalls are widely spaced with the uneven gait particular to seamen. The other set is evenly spaced -- closer together. Further, you can see on the ground the swirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists back presumably to see if he is being followed. Left footed, means left handed. The dark coloration of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber -- a type of non-conductive soles used by researchers experimenting with electricity. (he pauses) Finally, there can be no argument -- the game is afoot! Come, Watson!
 DATA / Hear that? What do those footfalls tell you, Watson?
 GEORDI / That we're on the right track?
 DATA / More particularly, that our opposition does indeed consist of two men... that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged Doctor Pulaski. We must hurry --
 GEORDI / You know all this because you read it in a Holmes story, right?
 DATA / Not at all... Since we do not hear the doctor's footfalls, we must presume she is being carried, and since we do not hear her calling for help, we know she is gagged. Further... both sets of footfalls are heavy and masculine -- one man seems to shuffle and stumble in an irregular pattern... Since the ground is level, I must conclude that Doctor Pulaski is struggling against her captor, sporadically knocking him off stride. It is deduction, pure and simple... well, perhaps not that simple.
 DATA / (continuing) Here we go, Watson -- I daresay we have caught up rather nicely with our quarry --
 DATA / (continuing) There should be a doorway.
 GEORDI / (to Data) Well, Holmes, let's hear it.
 DATA / There is nothing here of relevance. I do not see how this connects with the disappearance of the doctor.
 DATA / Doctor Kate Pulaski. But do not concern yourself, Inspector. You have enough on your mind.
 GEORDI / Inspector, perhaps I can be of assistance... As I take note of this dead man, I deduce that he was strangled.
 GEORDI / (continuing) The finger marks on his throat indicate the cause of death, and, since there are signs of a struggle, it's obvious that his killer was a stranger, who caught him from behind.
 DATA / No. Look at his shoes. He's more a convict -- released just today from Dartmoor prison... He spent the day in a tavern where he consumed large quantities of gin -- with his killer, who followed him to this spot -- and waited over there until the victim slipped into a drunken stupor, then out of fear, motivated only by self-protection strangled him.
 DATA / (continuing) There is your killer, Inspector.
 DATA / (continuing) And when you check, I believe you will find this poor soul is the victim's common law wife, who has been dreading his release because he was a vile and abusive man.
 GEORDI / But, Holmes she doesn't have the strength of strangling him.
 DATA / Not with her hands -- no. But with this.
 DATA / (continuing) When used as a garrote, these beads will leave marks quite similar to fingerprints, except, my dear Watson... the marks on the victim are too evenly spaced to be caused by human hands.
 DATA / Inspector -- for reasons strictly personal -- I must leave. Come, Watson, this murder is not connected with our case.
 GEORDI / (excitedly) If this murder isn't connected to the disappearance of Doctor Pulaski, then the computer is running an independent program.
 DATA / Yes.
 GEORDI / Why?
 DATA) / (puzzled) I do not know... and that troubles me.
 GEORDI / Then you don't know what's coming next?
 DATA / No.
 GEORDI / (still enjoying the game) That's what I wanted to hear.
 DATA / Allow us to pass.
 DATA / Release my coat or I will be forced to give you a severe thrashing.
 GEORDI / It's getting a little rough. Where to, now?
 DATA / We will find Doctor Pulaski inside.
 GEORDI / How do you know that?
 DATA / It is the only obvious choice.
 GEORDI / Why, all of a sudden would the obvious choice be the correct choice? Isn't this a game of misdirection?
 DATA / Not any more. He wants us to find him.
 GEORDI / Who does?
 DATA / The master criminal. The man Holmes could only defeat at the cost of his own life at Reichenbach falls - our adversary, my dear Watson is none other than Professor Moriarty himself.
 GEORDI / Great -- now this is really getting good.
 GEORDI / There's nothing in here but these barrels.
 DATA / ... and a trail. (indicating the tracks in the dust) Which is so well marked, that obviously we are meant to follow it.
 GEORDI / Another dead end.
 DATA / No Watson, not a dead end at all. Here -- can you see these scratches?
 GEORDI / The doctor was right, now we have a game worth playing.
 DATA / Professor Moriarty, I presume?
 GEORDI / How did you know that?
 DATA / He is the one worthy opponent created by the author, Conan Doyle.
 GEORDI / (slightly concerned) What's he mean? How would he know we're not who we appear to be?
 DATA / Where is Doctor Pulaski?
 DATA / She would not have answered any questions.
 DATA / (interrupts) Have you injured her?
 GEORDI / Data...
 DATA / Say nothing!
 GEORDI / This isn't right, Data. How can a holographic image call for the arch?
 GEORDI / Data! What's going on?
 DATA / We must leave.
 GEORDI / What's on the paper?
 DATA / (calls) Computer! Exit!
 GEORDI / Will you please tell me what is going on?
 DATA / Computer. Execute a complete shutdown of the Holodeck.
 DATA / Explain.
 GEORDI / The program is still running. It didn't shut down.
 DATA / We must see the captain.
 GEORDI / What is it? What's on the paper? Why can't you shut down the Holodeck? Data -- wait.
 DATA / This.
 GEORDI / This isn't possible. How could a character from 1890 London be able to draw a picture of our starship? Who has control of the computer?
 DATA / He does -- Moriarty.
 GEORDI / How is that possible? I don't understand.
 DATA / Neither do I.
 GEORDI / What about the doctor? Is she all right?
 DATA / No. She is in grave danger.
 PICARD has assembled his staff -- TROI, RIKER, WORF, / Data, and Geordi (the latter two still in Victorian costume) -- he is holding Moriarty's sketch of the Enterprise in his hands.
 PICARD / Computer. Tell me. Why wasn't the Holodeck program terminated?
 PICARD / On whose authority?
 GEORDI / Me?
 PICARD / Tell me again -- exactly what happened.
 GEORDI / Doctor Pulaski and I had a discussion about whether Data could solve an original Holmes-type mystery.
 PICARD / And you asked the computer to provide one.
 GEORDI / Yes... with a worthy opponent.
 PICARD / Worthy of Holmes?
 GEORDI / Oh, my God. I asked for a Sherlock Holmes-type mystery with an opponent capable of defeating Data. That must be it.
 PICARD / (in French) Terrible!
 GEORDI / Captain... I'm sorry...
 PICARD / I understand, Lieutenant. Well, at least now we have part of an explanation. The computer is not trying to confound "Holmes," which would be relatively easy, it has been ordered to create an adversary to defeat Data.
 GEORDI / ... I got carried away...
 RIKER / That's past. Data, this character Moriarty... you said he called for the arch...
 DATA / Yes.
 PICARD / So he is able to access the computer.
 DATA / And perhaps also our library files. That level of information would be necessary in order to create a true adversary for me.
 PICARD / Theorize, Data. What are his limits?
 DATA / He is still a fictional character, originally programmed with nineteenth century knowledge.
 RIKER / But with access now to the twenty-fourth century.
 PICARD / What does he need to begin making use of that?
 DATA / Only time.
 WORF / Sir, I can lead a security team to sweep the Holodeck, find the Doctor, and bring her out.
 DATA / Captain, I believe that would place the doctor at risk. It is probable that the mortality failsafe has been overridden.
 PICARD / Computer, locate Doctor Pulaski.
 PICARD / And her vital signs?
 PICARD / Counselor Troi, have you a sense of our opponent?
 TROI / It is difficult for me to separate a single individual from all the disorder I feel down there. Captain, what is unusual about this is that I should not be able to sense a holographic projection at all -- yet I do.
 RIKER / Captain, recommend we try to destroy the hologram-generations themselves. Is that possible, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Using wave guides, I could split a particle stream out of the matter_antimatter chamber and route it down through existing conduit into the Holodeck -- if it is accelerated to sufficient velocity that will quite literally wash away all the present holographic constructs -- the London buildings, the streets, the people, all gone... including Moriarty.
 PICARD / And Doctor Pulaski?
 RIKER / The particle stream will tear apart human flesh as well, that option is not acceptable.
 TROI / Captain, I am suddenly sensing more order to the energy on the Holodeck -- as if one unifying force, one consciousness, is trying to bring it all into focus.
 DATA / Captain, there is only one thing which can explain this. In programming Moriarty to defeat me, not Holmes, he had to be able to acquire something which I possess.
 PICARD / Exactly what?
 DATA / Consciousness. He cannot defeat me without it.
 PICARD / Computer -- what happened?
 PICARD / Data -- I think it's best if you and I returned to the Holodeck.
 DATA / I will change into my uniform.
 PICARD / No -- I'll change into an appropriate costume. It seems he feeds on knowledge. Let's not give your nemesis any more information than we have to.
 PICARD / Nice suit.
 WORF / Thank you, Captain. I'll be standing by to assist you on the Holodeck if needed.
 RIKER / (grins at Worf) You'd be a sensation in London.
 PICARD / Shall we sally forth, Mr. Holmes? (to computer) Computer tell me, is the program still running?
 PICARD / Open.
 PICARD / (continuing) We don't have much time. He is getting more control of his environment. Come on, let us see if we can't beat Professor Moriarty by giving him absolutely everything he wants... and then some.
 PICARD / Obviously, he's attempting to alter the programming here.
 DATA / Captain?
 PICARD / Tuppence -- two pence. (placing it in his pocket) A sign of good luck. We may need some...
 PICARD / Data!
 DATA / (while holding the Thug aloft) Captain, this holographic image differs from any I have encountered. It is possible he could have seriously injured you.
 PICARD / It's more serious than that. I think the mortality failsafe has been circumvented. He could have killed me.
 DATA / Query. Is the converse also true? Are these projections susceptible to our technology?
 PICARD / I don't know.
 PICARD / Take his knife and let him go, Data.
 DATA / (indicating)) We'll find Moriarty this way. The warehouse.
 PICARD / Moriarty is making it very easy for us to find him.
 DATA / Captain, permission to test my theory.
 PICARD / Granted.
 DATA / Under normal circumstances the phaser would pass right through the holographic image.
 PICARD / How will it affect a character like Moriarty?
 DATA / The effect on him should be the same as it was on the crate.
 PICARD / (to Pulaski) Are you all right?
 DATA / Crumpets?
 PICARD / You two have gotten awfully...
 RIKER / Bridge to Holodeck Control. Worf.
 WORF / Here, sir.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Status. Has anything changed?
 WORF / No.
 PICARD / Moriarty, you were conjured up to attempt to defeat Holmes here... and once that attempt is concluded -- win or lose -- your program has run its course, your existence is done.
 DATA / Congratulations, Professor Moriarty, I capitulate to the better man -- your victory is well earned.
 PICARD / Yes -- I know that, Moriarty, but you haven't. You shook this ship because you wanted to get my attention -- you have it. So what is it you want?
 PICARD / That... may not be completely true, Professor. This... which we call our "Holodeck" makes use of the same principle in another of our devices called a "transporter." By the year in which we live, humans have discovered that matter and energy are interchangeable. On this Holodeck energy has been converted to matter and thus you have substance, but only here.
 PICARD / You are not alive, Moriarty, as I said you are only...
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / No. He is more.
 PICARD / That's one possible definition.
 PICARD / I'm responsible for the safety of this vessel and crew.
 PICARD / (gently) That may not be possible.
 PICARD / I cannot give you what you want.
 PICARD / That is true --
 PICARD / And I do not want to kill you.
 PICARD / Bridge, this is the Captain.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / This is the bridge.
 PICARD / Number One, the situation is under control.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Professor Moriarty, this ship has vast, library memory capacity.
 PICARD / We will save this program of you. You will not be extinguished. We will save every aspect of you that exists now. And I promise you we will try to discover a way to bring you back in a form capable of leaving the Holodeck.
 PICARD / As you wish. A short good-bye. (toward arch) Computer, save this program... then discontinue it for now.
 DATA / Right up to the end, he never knew.
 PICARD / No. He didn't.
 PICARD / That he could leave the Holodeck.
 DATA / I do not know how, but for Moriarty it was.
 DATA / No, what the captain said was that we do not know how to convert Holodeck matter into a more permanent form. Which is true. Even after we review this program, we still may not have the answer.
 PICARD / Doctor, even with all his assurances -- that character was still Professor Moriarty. I will need to know a lot more about him before I allow him loose on my ship; he has, after all, made his reputation through cunning and deceit.
 PICARD / Data.
 DATA / No. The paper. This piece of paper was created as part of the Holodeck illusion. If it could leave the Holodeck, so too could Moriarty.
 DATA / It is elementary, my dear Doctor... It is elementary.
 PICARD / Damaged?
 GEORDI / Yes. A spar was cracked when the Enterprise was shaken. Otherwise she seemed to have weathered it nicely.
 PICARD / She's beautifully turned out, Lieutenant -- wonderful testimony to simpler times.
 GEORDI / Yes -- it's just that I can't help thinking how badly it could have been damaged all because I misspoke a word.
 PICARD / Will she still sail?
 GEORDI / Yes sir.
 PICARD / As will we.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain -- Starship Victory has arrived.
 PICARD / On my way, Number One.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42502.7. We are traveling in the Omega Twelve System traversing between a clustering of small planets that form the coalition of Madena VI.
 We see the complement of people who normally make up the bridge crew. DATA and WESLEY at the front consoles controlling CONN and OPS. RIKER sits on one side of PICARD at the Command Area, the opposite seat empty, / WORF stands near the Science Stations which are manned / by n.d. crewmembers.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Each of these planets is populated by separate humanoid people who co-exist and trade technology and minerals under a precarious but successful treaty.
 WORF / We have an unidentified vessel approaching.
 RIKER / Give me grid markers.
 WORF / Sector three-nine-five-six, mark zero-nine-one.
 DATA / Sensor readings place overall dimension of vehicle an interplanetary cargo ship.
 WORF / One life sign on board, appears to be humanoid.
 DATA / A vessel of that size usually maintains a crew of six.
 WORF / Minimum armament present.
 DATA / Sensors show cargo holds are empty.
 WORF / The course is inconsistent with normal cargo routes.
 RIKER / This could be a primitive method to elude detection.
 DATA / Readout shows a burnout in inertial guidance system...
 RIKER / The pilot is attempting to hold his vessel in check manually.
 WORF / That could be a pretense.
 PICARD / Captain's log, supplemental. We have just encountered and identified an interplanetary cargo vessel which is apparently in need of emergency assistance. We will make every effort to do so. (beat) Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / This is the USS Enterprise. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, over.
 OKONA'S COM VOICE / And this is the cargo ship Erstwhile "limping" and "skidding" off course. Captain Okona at your service. As you see, there is no need for phasers, Captain. I'm harmless and not quite ready yet for mercy killing.
 PICARD / You were never considered a danger to us, Captain Okona.
 OKONA'S COM VOICE / It's a shame. I can remember when I was at least considered a "risk."
 WORF / The ship is in viewer range now, Captain.
 PICARD / Main Viewer on.
 OKONA / I'm the owner and operator of this craft and since we both know you scanned my vessel, you know I'm alone and empty... (smile) ... and it's truly a rare occasion for a man of my charm, beauty and talent.
 OKONA / But then with the condition of this vessel I'm glad I have no responsibilities except for myself till I can get some repairs.
 PICARD / Counselor, can you read him?
 TROI / His emotions suggest that he is mischievous, irreverent and somewhat brazen. (beat) And some other things... (unsure) The word that seems to describe him best is "rogue."
 DATA / Rogue? Accessing "rogue." (kicks in) Cad, knave, rake, rascal, scoundrel, villain.
 TROI / Yes, all of that, but he shows no malevolence, or ill will.
 PICARD / What form of assistance can we offer you, Captain?
 OKONA / I had a burnout on my guidance system. I'd appreciate it if I could use your facilities to repair it.
 WESLEY / It would be possible.
 PICARD / Estimate, Mister Data.
 DATA / Time for repair would be seven hours sixteen minutes.
 RIKER / Okona will have to shut down while we verify specifications.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, prepare security procedures. (to Okona) We can accommodate you.
 WORF / I'll allow him limited access.
 RIKER / If you'll prepare to shut down your engines we'll lock on tractors and beam you aboard.
 OKONA / Many thanks, Captain Picard.
 RIKER / Transporter Chief, prepare to beam aboard from Tractor lock bearing.
 OKONA / Is that a woman's voice I hear?
 PICARD / Yes. Now please follow the directions of Commander Riker so our ship can get back to its normal routine.
 PICARD / (continuing) Something funny, Commander Riker.
 RIKER / The unexpected, like what's happening now, IS our normal routine.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Hold it steady, Wesley. We're ready to link up. On my command...
 WESLEY (O.S.) / Aye Number One.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Easy... easy... (beat) Engage. Shut down engines, Captain Okona.
 RIKER / Transporter Room proceed with Beaming Operation. I'm on my way.
 WORF / Your weapons, please.
 OKONA / You're the tough one on this ship. The muscle man.
 WORF / Security.
 OKONA / That's the usual name for warriors nowadays.
 OKONA / (continuing) It's more of a piece of jewelry than a weapon. A remembrance.
 WORF / It will be returned when you leave.
 RIKER / Welcome aboard, Captain Okona. I'm Commander Riker. (shakes hands) If you turn over the inoperative part to Lieutenant La Forge he'll begin repairs.
 OKONA / I'd be most happy to do the work myself, I'm sort of a "hands on" type...
 WORF / That will not be permitted.
 OKONA / Can I at least watch? Maybe offer some suggestions?
 RIKER / I think that could be arranged...
 OKONA / Here you are, Lieutenant. I leave it in your capable hands.
 WESLEY / (reacts) No, this is Lieutenant La Forge, I'm only an ensign.
 OKONA / Well ensigns have names, don't they?
 WESLEY / Wesley... Wesley Crusher..
 OKONA / (enjoying himself) Nice to meet you Ensign "Wesley Wesley" Crusher.
 OKONA / And thank you for beaming me here and inviting me to see a truly beautiful woman. (touches her chin) You have the majestic carriage and loveliness that could surely be traced back to the noble families who once ruled romantic lands with benevolent and tender hands.
 OKONA / Of course, (beat) But it's how I say it that's most important. The feeling, the warmth, the attraction I have for you, (soft beat) the attraction that we share.
 RIKER / Mister Okona seems to have excellent vision and a healthy libido.
 WORF / Which could add to the security problem. I'll supervise him closely.
 GEORDI / (aware) I'm sure you will, Worf.
 RIKER / If you'll follow Lieutenant La Forge, we'll get right to work.
 OKONA / Now isn't that a beautifully formed picture of sex appeal?
 DATA / I do not know what you mean. (beat; then explains) I am an android.
 OKONA / Well then... Have you seen any great looking computers lately?
 OKONA / (continuing) That's a joke. (beat) It's funny.
 DATA / (still oblivious, but covering) Yes, of course it is.
 GEORDI / It's the Zelebium contacts that wore down and then fused. Why not replace them with Tricellite?
 OKONA / Tricellite isn't available in this system. It wouldn't be available to me if I have to replace it.
 GEORDI / I don't think your spacecraft will outlast the part.
 OKONA / (smiles) You mean the age of it or the way I fly it?
 GEORDI / The stress test shows that you tend to push it beyond its designed capabilities.
 OKONA / Lieutenant La Forge, I've never been told that I'm somewhat reckless in a kinder, or more gentlemanly manner; but since the pattern of my life has relegated me to interplanetary speed deliveries rather than universal exploration, I'm forced to add a flamboyancy and a zest to the doldrums of my existence.
 WESLEY / Captain Okona, I don't know whether I'd rather take a flight with you or listen to you talk.
 OKONA / Thank you Ensign Crusher, Crusher.
 WESLEY / (getting into it) It's Wesley, Wesley.
 OKONA / I'll make it easy on both of us. I'll just call you Tiger.
 DATA / Captain Picard is not fond of nicknames.
 OKONA / Your gallant Captain Picard. I'd like to meet him... I'll stroll on the bridge and say hello.
 DATA / You are not permitted on the bridge. You are restricted to your quarters or the Ten-Forward lounge unless escorted by a crewmember.
 OKONA / (shrugs) I've broken some small rules before.
 GEORDI / You do and besides the bells and lights that will go off, our benevolent and kindly Lieutenant Worf will offer you a new kind of greeting.
 OKONA / Well then, would you escort me to C deck?
 GEORDI / I'm busy rebuilding your ship.
 OKONA / Then Mister Data sir, I would feel privileged if you allow me to be in your company while you escort me to my destination...
 OKONA / You ever been cold?
 DATA / No.
 OKONA / How about warm?
 DATA / The temperature on this vessel is regulated to within a fraction of a degree of the perfect comfort range. I am also able to react to any changes just as a humanoid.
 OKONA / How about drunk? Ever do that?
 DATA / That is not possible. One moment.
 DATA / (continuing) I was correct. I am not designed to react to any synthenol intake but apparently it is possible for me to become intoxicated.
 OKONA / I don't understand that at all.
 DATA / It seems that I have been adapting some human peculiarities over the last three tours of duty.
 OKONA / What about love?
 DATA / The act or the emotion?
 OKONA / They're both the same to me.
 DATA / I believe that deduction to be inaccurate.
 OKONA / Maybe.
 OKONA / (continuing) Life is like loading twice your cargo weight on your spacecraft... if it's canaries and you can keep half of them flying all the time, you're all right.
 OKONA / Don't you get it?
 DATA / Get what?
 OKONA / The punch line... The gag... That was a joke I told you.
 DATA / I still do not understand.
 OKONA / You don't know what a joke is?
 DATA / Of course I do. (as he computes) A joke is an antic, a caper, mischief, prank, trick, quip, witticism.
 OKONA / (overlapping) That's the dictionary meaning. I'm talking about humor, fun. (beat) Do you know what "funny" is?
 OKONA / Is that C-nine-two-nine?
 DATA / The room to the left. Why?
 OKONA / You probably wouldn't understand that either...
 RIKER / What's the status of the repair?
 GEORDI / On schedule. The difficulty is Okona has to be able to repair this part himself next time.
 WESLEY / Commander, do you know much about him?
 RIKER / Just that he's an interesting man.
 WESLEY / He's a lot more than that. He's a capable engineer.
 GEORDI / In a practical sense he's excellent.
 WESLEY / We've seen him handle his ship, and he certainly knows how to handle people.
 RIKER / Everything you say is true.
 WESLEY / Then why is he what he is?
 RIKER / Why is he operating a cargo route alone rather than being a member of a large organization like we are?
 WESLEY / Yes, that's it.
 RIKER / I would say because he chooses to do exactly what he does.
 WESLEY / A cargo master?
 RIKER / (mimics the tone) An ensign in Engineering?
 RIKER / (continuing) His choice. Someday you'll make yours.
 WESLEY / I already have.
 DATA / You agree that I am missing a very important human factor.
 DATA / I never knew I had to.
 DATA / But I am not unhappy. I just do not seem to break out in laughter with everyone else when Okona says certain things.
 DATA / (defensive) Of course I do. (his computer kicks in) It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, a fluctuation of words which concludes with "trick" ending, it is...
 DATA / (stolid beat) I understand better than you think. You just told me a joke and I am not laughing.
 DATA / Maybe it was not funny.
 DATA / How can you be sure?
 DATA / I agree. Now what do I do about it?
 DATA / I wish to learn about jokes...
 DATA / Show me one of those.
 DATA / Humanoid. One who is able to understand and tell a joke.
 DATA / Show me both.
 DATA / That one. RW nine, three, two, one, six -- twentieth century.
 DATA / I want to know what is funny.
 DATA / Nothing makes me laugh, but I still want to do it.
 DATA / Time has no meaning in this instance. It could be endless.
 DATA / I assure you, I am completely trainable and capable of indoctrination. Show me what is funny.
 DATA / That is considered funny?
 DATA / You mean if you twist your face, bend over at the waist, mess up your hair, and cross your eyes it is a pretense that would be funny.
 DATA / I can do everything else that I want to do. I just want to know what is funny. I want to be able to involve myself in other people's laughter. (quieter beat) I want to "join in."
 DATA / Proceed.
 DATA / Access faster...
 DATA / Faster. Move to maximum speed.
 DATA / This gentleman went to see his surgeon and was informed that he needed an operation. The man thought about that and then said, "I would like a second opinion." The doctor said, "Okay, you are ugly too."
 DATA / (continuing) Was I funny?
 DATA / I was not funny...
 DATA / Who was that woman I saw you with?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (filtered) Lieutenant Commander Data, report to the Main Bridge immediately. I repeat, report to the Main Bridge immediately.
 DATA / I will be back.
 WESLEY / We have an "unidentified" in Sector four.
 WORF / Unidentified craft Sector four to Sector four two six one. Overtaking us, no response to our hailing.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies in all languages and on all channels.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open. No response.
 DATA / Sensors report a minimum range combat craft of the Squadron Class, twenty-six crew.
 WORF / (overlap) Captain, they have locked phasers.
 PICARD / (somewhat puzzled) Phasers?
 RIKER / (same look) Regulations call for a Yellow Alert.
 PICARD / It's too small of a craft to be of any threat to us. Do you agree, Lieutenant Worf?
 WORF / We could blow it out of space before it could scratch our hull.
 PICARD / And I doubt that they are so primitive that they wouldn't know it. Ensign Crusher, reduce speed to allow them to overtake.
 RIKER / May I ask why, sir?
 PICARD / They show a great deal of courage. Perhaps I would like to show them some respect, or perhaps I'm just curious.
 RIKER / I understand, Captain. Would a "courteous" Yellow Alert apply at this time?
 PICARD / (covers a smile) That won't be necessary, Number One. But continue to hail them and prepare for a gentlemanly surrender if needed.
 WORF / Still no response to our hail.
 DATA / The "stranger" vessel has slowed and is holding its position.
 WORF / Captain, we are being hailed.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise... What is the reason for this aggressive approach?
 PICARD / It was in need of emergency repairs. It was our obligation to assist.
 PICARD / On what authority?
 PICARD / What crimes?
 WESLEY / Captain, we have another Class four armed spacecraft approaching, from the opposite sector...
 PICARD / Another ship from Atlec?
 DATA / Similar in specifications and capabilities, but a variation in markings and hailing language.
 PICARD / (to Debin) Hold your position, Mister Debin. (to Data) Cut off Main Screen.
 PICARD / (continuing) Identify approaching craft.
 DATA / Sensors indicate it to be a security vessel from the planet Straleb.
 WORF / We could swat both mosquitoes easily.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 WORF / (continuing) They are returning our hail on the proper channel.
 PICARD / On screen.
 KUSHELL / I am Secretary Kushell from the Legation of Unity of the planet Straleb.
 PICARD / I am Captain Picard.
 KUSHELL / (overlapping) We know who you are, Captain Picard. We have been monitoring your communications and we know of the demands made by Debin of the planet Atlec.
 PICARD / Then you know that we intend no hostile interaction with either of you.
 KUSHELL / You only have to concede to one demand.
 PICARD / The word "demand" has the tone of finality.
 KUSHELL / It is a word I have chosen. (beat) We demand you turn Okona over to us immediately.
 PICARD / (to Wesley) Mute the Main Viewer. (to Worf) Lieutenant Worf, Mister Okona to the Main Bridge immediately.
 WORF / Yes sir.
 PICARD / Engage the screen. (to Kushell) The same "demand" has been made by the Atlec legation.
 KUSHELL / I have no interest in their request. We intend to back up our legal right to Okona.
 PICARD / (knowing) I'd rather you didn't escalate this situation any further.
 KUSHELL / You're my son. You obey orders, you do not interfere with them. (to Picard, enraged) We are prepared to take Okona by force if we have to. The honor and prestige of this nation are at stake. (beat) We are ready to die for that.
 PICARD / We do not intend for that to be at our hand. I will respond to your request shortly -- (then:) Main Viewer off.
 WORF / (to Okona) I have orders to escort you to the Main Bridge immediately.
 OKONA / I'm sure it can wait a few minutes.
 WORF / Now!!
 WORF / I'd like that, but I have orders.
 OKONA / (nods) Some other time then.
 OKONA / (continuing) Just remember, it took three armed men to rip me from your arms.
 OKONA / Am I going to meet Captain Picard?
 WORF / Definitely.
 OKONA / Did I say something funny?
 WORF / Captain Picard, this is Thadiun Okona.
 PICARD / In there... We'll talk in there...
 PICARD / Mister Okona, you were welcomed on board and given the security of this ship openly and without any undue investigation. In turn the only obligation we placed you under was that you do not come aboard the Enterprise under false pretenses. It seems that you did.
 OKONA / If you mean my "socializing" with the members of the crew?
 PICARD / No, you are free to interact with the members of the crew. First, I'm talking about a man named Debin. Are you familiar with him?
 OKONA / He's from Atlec. I've had dealings with some of his family.
 PICARD / Then perhaps you can explain why his spacecraft is prepared to attack us unless we give him custody of you.
 OKONA / I can't explain.
 PICARD / Then tell me why Kushell of the planet Straleb is demanding the same thing?
 OKONA / Is he here also?
 PICARD / And quite adamant. Now answer please. What crimes have you committed?
 OKONA / I am not a criminal.
 PICARD / Why do these men want you?
 OKONA / I can't say.
 PICARD / You will say. You're on my ship.
 OKONA / (serious now) It wouldn't be the honorable thing to do. I may be many less than auspicious things, but I am a gentleman. I won't break that code.
 PICARD / They are prepared to attack the Enterprise.
 OKONA / (reacts) That would be crazy. They wouldn't stand a chance...
 PICARD / Exactly. (studies Okona) Then perhaps you could give me some reasons as to why I should consider destroying these people to save you?
 OKONA / I can't think of any right now.
 PICARD / Neither can I.
 PICARD / Put Debin on screen.
 PICARD / No. You've made your requests but you haven't told me why.
 PICARD / I'm afraid that's not good enough.
 PICARD / I do sympathize with you. If you will allow me just a little more time.
 KUSHELL / You'll be dust before you aim your first missile. I have a perfect right to Okona. He's a thief. He stole the Jewel of Thesia. A national heritage.
 KUSHELL / He's mine.
 OKONA / One at a time. Who accuses me of stealing?
 KUSHELL / I do, you thief. Me and my son, Benzan. Okona was my son's friend. He took advantage of that friendship to plunder a national treasure.
 PICARD / What do you have to say about that Okona?
 OKONA / Nothing right now. Let them do all the talking.
 PICARD / Gentlemen if you please!
 PICARD / (continuing) You will get my decision as soon as I can confer with my advisors and in the interest of maintaining peace I am jamming communications between your two ships. Picard out.
 PICARD / Okona, Doctor, Counselor, Lieutenant Worf, Geordi, the conference room if you please. Have Doctor Pulaski join us...
 OKONA / Last meals always taste the best and hunger won't make me a better person.
 TROI / Neither one of the allegations is considered a capital crime.
 OKONA / I'll never reach either of those planets alive. They have lost too much face over these incidents.
 PICARD / And yet it provides the possibility of even more violence.
 OKONA / You're not afraid of those two or what they can do to you.
 PICARD / It's what I may have to do to them that concerns me. If I turn you over to Debin, I will have to deal with Kushell. If you go to Kushell, I will have Debin to administer to. Or perhaps both of them would decide to attack us. Fatalities could be total.
 OKONA / I hate to have to be the one to say this, but you don't owe me anything.
 PICARD / I'm well aware of that, but it doesn't change anything. (beat) Are you innocent, Thadiun Okona?
 OKONA / Innocent? Absolutely not, Captain Picard. I'll make no excuses for my lifestyle. (beat) But I have not committed the crimes that I've been accused of or any others similar.
 PICARD / Then my predicament is confirmed.
 OKONA / In that case, Captain, I can't make it any easier on you.
 PICARD / (reacts) Apparently you've never been concerned about making it easier on anyone... There are two men out there who do not consider this a joke and are willing to face death as a matter of honor. They should be respected, not laughed at.
 OKONA / You seemed to have reached a decision about me, Captain.
 PICARD / Only about what I think you are. What to do about it is still a problem.
 OKONA / I'll help you with it. (beat) Stall Debin and Kushell. Give me enough time to get the guidance system re-installed and I'll go on my own.
 RIKER / Their ships are bigger and faster than yours.
 OKONA / You'll still be able to warp away and I'll take care of myself.
 OKONA / (smile) I'll dazzle them with my brilliance and dexterity.
 PICARD / (beat) I don't like it.
 OKONA / You have very little choice.
 PICARD / (a few beats) I know. It will be impossible to stall very long.
 OKONA / "Just long enough" is all I need...
 PICARD / (shrugging) Anything I have to.
 OKONA / Now you're starting to sound like me, Captain.
 PICARD / Heaven forbid.
 PICARD / Engage Main Viewer.
 PICARD / (continuing) Ah, gentlemen... If you'll just bear with me, I have a few questions.
 OKONA / Looks like an excellent job. You're quite a craftsman Lieutenant La Forge. How soon will it be finished?
 GEORDI / What's the rush? I thought you liked it here.
 OKONA / I did. It stopped liking me. Time for me to disappear.
 WESLEY / Where will you go?
 OKONA / A new place, if I make it.
 WESLEY / Don't you ever stay anywhere?
 OKONA / Not for a long time.
 WESLEY / I know that's the way you want to be and it is your choice, but I don't understand. You like people. Why do you want to be alone all the time?
 GEORDI / It's ready. You should be able to install this in less than five minutes.
 OKONA / Like you said Geordi, what's the rush? (moving) I have some friends around here.
 PICARD / One moment please, gentlemen. Screen off.
 PICARD / I've used every pretext I could think of. The result is they've aimed their full ordinance at us and are prepared to attack. I can't delay any longer.
 OKONA / I'm not leaving.
 PICARD / (reacts) We've gone over this before. I thought you made a decision.
 OKONA / Don't worry, I'm not staying either. (long beat) I've decided to surrender myself to one of them.
 RIKER / Which one?
 OKONA / (laughs) Put them on screen and place your bets. The odds are two to one...
 PICARD / On screen.
 KUSHELL / It took long enough. Now when can I have Okona?
 KUSHELL / Do not delay your decision again. I'm warning you not to do that, Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Yes, both of you are most adept at issuing warnings. (beat) Mister Okona has volunteered to deal with this himself.
 OKONA / I'll speak my piece before I walk to your gallows. As I said before I am not a thief. I am also not a character of exceptional good name and reputation; so, as I never chose to become a thief, I have never chosen to become a father either. (long beat) Given the choice between the two I must say that marriage to the beautiful and affectionate Yanar is a much more pleasant sentence. (MORE)
 OKONA (Cont'd) / (pause) So my dear Yanar, if you would do me the honor of becoming my wife I will do everything in my power to make our marriage happy and fruitful.
 KUSHELL / That's right. Okona is still a thief.
 KUSHELL / The Jewel of Thesia!
 KUSHELL / Then where is it?
 PICARD / (to Okona) Benzan has a certain flair for the language that is similar to yours.
 OKONA / A little bit of me might have rubbed off on the boy. I didn't think he would let me hang.
 PICARD / You placed great faith in him.
 OKONA / He's a friend...
 KUSHELL / (to Benzan) Why would you steal what would eventually become yours?
 KUSHELL / (stunned) Yanar said it was Okona's.
 KUSHELL / So Okona does have the jewel.
 OKONA / Don't Yanar. You're angry about the embarrassment of all this and maybe the timing and approach is not the most romantic, but I know you love Benzan and I don't want to see you throw away that feeling because we adults do not know how to behave properly.
 OKONA / I carried your messages back and forth for almost six months. I smuggled each of you into the other's homeland. You feel for him the same way he feels for you. (frustrated beat) So for heaven's sake girl, you have to marry the boy because I've finally run out of words.
 RIKER / I don't believe that.
 DATA / It is mathematically possible.
 PICARD / Okona defies even the science of mathematics.
 DATA / Was that funny?
 PICARD / (caught up in it) Then tell him.
 KUSHELL / (softer) Then I'll have to withdraw my charges of theft. By our law Benzan must present the jewel to his wife.
 KUSHELL / You'll live on Straleb.
 PICARD / Gentlemen, this is a matter to be settled between yourselves. I have only two words for both of you. (long beat) Picard out.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Take over, Will. Mister Okona and I are going to drink a toast to the newlyweds.
 TROI / Weddings bring out emotions in me that I never could quite understand. I get so sentimental.
 WORF / We could have destroyed both crafts without even using our photon torpedoes. They were totally vulnerable.
 GEORDI / (patiently) Maybe next time, Worf. Maybe next time.
 DATA / I wish to reinstate the same program.
 DATA / We will continue.
 DATA / I told a joke.
 DATA / No one laughed.
 DATA / She said I "killed" the joke.
 DATA / Perhaps he is right. An audience could be the difference. (to Holodeck) Holodeck, give me an audience.
 DATA / Good evening ladies and "germs."
 DATA / You know I come from a town so small it had a fraction for a zip code.
 DATA / (continuing) ... It was so small in fact that it didn't have a Godfather of Crime... it had a Nephew..
 DATA / I was so ugly as a child they hung a pork chop around my neck so the dog would play with me. Then there was the gene bank where they crossed a lion and a parrot. They weren't sure what they got but when it spoke, they listened.
 DATA / (continuing) Or the human cannonball that was hired and fired in the same night.
 DATA / Holodeck off.
 DATA / (continuing) It was a Holodeck audience. They were programmed to laugh at anything...
 DATA / I have heard it... (beat) I have heard them all.
 RIKER / Hold the speed, Captain Okona. We'll disengage at my command. (beat) Disengage.
 WESLEY / Separated.
 OKONA / I'm under my own power. Thank you, Enterprise. Thank you, Captain Picard.
 PICARD / I think it turned out to be "my pleasure," Mister Okona.
 OKONA / You've got a bizarre sense of humor, Captain.
 PICARD / Stretched to the limit with you, but thankfully still present. I think I might miss your presence, but I would like it to remain a fond memory.
 OKONA / Well put Captain Picard, and good-bye sir.
 PICARD / Good-bye Captain Okona.
 OKONA / What about you Data? You can say good-bye, Data.
 DATA / "Good-bye Data."
 DATA / Was I funny?
 DATA (O.S.) / And there is the one about the girl in the nudist colony that nothing looked good on.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Warp speed Captain?
 PICARD (O.S.) / Please...
 as the lift stops and she steps out onto the bridge. Before her, WESLEY is at Conn, a CREWMAN at Ops, WORF at Tactical. She MOVES to Command to join RIKER and PICARD... / 
 PICARD / Any response from Gravesworld, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Nothing sir. Not since their initial communication.
 RIKER / They send out a plea for help, then shut off the transmitters so they can't tell if help's on the way. Doesn't make much sense, does it?
 PICARD / What's our e.t.a. at the planet, Mister Crusher?
 WESLEY / Thirty-six minutes to orbit, sir.
 PICARD / You understand the importance of doing everything we can for Doctor Graves.
 PICARD / Starfleet Command believes his work in quantum physics is reaching a critical stage. They consider this a priority one action.
 TROI / It's wonderful. What is it?
 GEORDI / (empty glass in hand) Water? Tastes more like...
 TROI / Heaven.
 GEORDI / Exactly. Where can I get some more of this?
 TROI / I'm not sure I can wait that long.
 GEORDI / (to Data) Hey, old friend. Any luck?
 DATA / I believe my quest has ended in complete success.
 GEORDI / Data's been scouring the library, in search of the perfect joke.
 DATA / I have explored seventy-six thousand, two hundred and twenty-three anecdotes thus far.
 TROI / Why, Data?
 DATA / It is an attempt to find the most humorous anecdote in recorded history. And I believe I have done just that.
 DATA / (deliberate) There were twelve birds sitting on a fence... Six had a notion to fly away. How many were left?
 GEORDI / Okay, I'll bite. Six.
 DATA / (happy, glowing) No, twelve! They only had a notion to fly away!
 DATA / You did not find it wildly hilarious?
 GEORDI / What do you think?
 DATA / Perhaps I should have described the interesting plumage of --
 WORF / Receiving a transmission from Gravesworld, sir. It's unfocused. Not directed specifically at us.
 PICARD / On screen, Mister Worf.
 KAREEN BRIANON a strikingly beautiful if somewhat / frail-looking woman in her early twenties. She seems anxious -- nervously looking over her shoulder as she speaks. We join her transmission in progress...
 KAREEN / ... If anyone can hear me, please send a doctor. Things are getting worse --
 PICARD / Try and raise her, Mister Crusher. Tell them we're minutes away.
 WESLEY / It's no good, sir. I don't believe they're receiving us.
 WORF / Our records show that she and Graves are the only ones living on the planet, Captain.
 RIKER / Then what scared her?
 GEORDI / Sir, I'm picking up another signal... but it's not from the planet.
 WESLEY / Confirmed. Point of origin... sector three-five mark seven.
 GEORDI / Signal is very weak, sir. Audio only.
 PICARD / Pipe it through, Mister La Forge.
 WORF / I show the Mary Rogers in that general vicinity, Captain. She's a transport ship, used to ferry settlers to new colonies. No other ships of any kind in this sector.
 RIKER / (concerned) Outer hull breached -- their air must be leaking out.
 PICARD / And what about Graves?
 PICARD / He's the man we came to assist! I have my orders, Doctor.
 WORF / Suggestion, sir.
 WORF / (continuing) Suggest we execute long range transport of away team to assist Dr. Graves at earliest possible moment. We can use the mass of the planet to slingshot us toward the stricken liner, thus making up most of the lost time.
 PICARD / (nodding, thoughtful) Mister Crusher, make it so -- prepare for extended touch and go orbit.
 WESLEY / (complying) Aye sir.
 PICARD / The transport may be a bit tricky. I'd like you to handle it, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Understood, Captain.
 PICARD / Assemble an away team, Number One. Include whatever medical assistants the Doctor deems necessary.
 PICARD / -- Thank you Doctor, but I'll make those decisions. (pause) You're going to Gravesworld.
 DATA / I cannot comprehend it. It is beyond my ability to reason.
 DATA / But this anecdote had all the elements humans find so diverting! A play on words, colorful characters, deception, a lively setting --
 DATA / (cocking his head) Interesting. How so?
 RIKER / (cheerful) Hello Guinan. Keeping this guy out of trouble?
 DATA / Excuse me sir, but in what way is Guinan attempting to restrain me from adversity?
 RIKER / Never mind, Data, I was only joking.
 DATA / That joke was funny. Was it not?
 RIKER / (intrigued smile) How did you know about that?
 RIKER / Come on Data. A great man awaits.
 DATA / May I ask a question, sir?
 RIKER / I think you just did.
 DATA / (thinking it over) Quite correct. May I ask you another question after this one?
 RIKER / (chuckling) Sure, what's on your mind?
 DATA / Do you think it is pointless for me to try and understand humor?
 RIKER / Pointless? Not necessarily.
 DATA / I believe that comprehending what is truly funny will bring me closer to... humanness. (pause) Until recently, I thought I was making progress.
 DATA / For example Commander, do you find this amusing? There were twelve....... aquatic fowl sitting on a fence, and six had --
 RIKER / -- Twelve. They only had a notion to fly away.
 DATA / How did you --
 RIKER / -- Are you kidding? That joke's become a legend on this ship.
 RIKER / Phaser on stun, Mister Worf. We don't know what's going on down there; no need to take chances.
 WORF / Agreed, sir.
 GEORDI / Remember folks, this is a long range transport. The effects will be a little unusual.
 RIKER / Understood. Energize.
 RIKER / You do now.
 TROI / Ohh... I know this is crazy, but for a moment I felt like I was trapped inside that wall.
 WORF / You were. For a moment.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER / We've arrived in Graves' home. All's quiet so far -- on the other hand, no one knew we were coming.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Use caution and investigate. Protect Graves' health at all cost. We're leaving orbit to assist the Mary Rogers. Back as soon as possible.
 RIKER / Understood, Captain. Riker out.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Let's look around -- see if anybody's home.
 DATA / Someone is home, sir.
 KAREEN / You heard me. Thank God.
 KAREEN / (continuing) I'm Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves' assistant. Are you... you with Starfleet?
 RIKER / Yes, we're from a ship called the Enterprise. We monitored your distress call but you never acknowledged our response.
 KAREEN / I'm sorry, I... couldn't take the chance...
 RIKER / What chance?
 KAREEN / I had no choice. I refuse to stand by and watch you deteriorate.
 KAREEN / He has pain, shortness of breath, irritability --
 KAREEN / We'll see about that, Ira. (to away team) I hope one of you is a doctor.
 RIKER / I thought you didn't like people?
 TROI / (a bit embarrassed) I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honor to meet you Doctor Graves.
 KAREEN / (soft, uncertain) Excuse me sir... Are you a Romulan?
 WORF / Hardly.
 WORF / (low growl) Do I have to stand here and be insulted?
 DATA / Uh, Lieutenant Commander Data, sir --
 DATA / Quite correct, sir! Did you know Soong?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42437.7. We've successfully transported the passengers and crew of the stricken liner Mary Rogers.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Tragically, six people died in the initial explosion, but the rest are now aboard and in good condition. We are heading back to Gravesworld with great dispatch.
 WESLEY / You wanted to see me, sir.
 PICARD / (still staring at space) Yes Ensign. I assume you would very much like to meet Doctor Graves.
 WESLEY / (brightening) Yes sir. His theories on spatial relationships are amazing! And his work in thermodynamics is --
 PICARD / -- Good, I get the idea. Providing his health is reasonably intact, I'm going to appoint you as his personal tour guide when he comes aboard. You have the run of the ship -- show him anything you think he'll find interesting, and for heaven's sake, don't talk his ear off!
 WESLEY / (excited) Yes sir. Understood. (pause, thoughtful) But why me, sir? I mean, not that I'm complaining --
 PICARD / -- Graves has a reputation for being difficult and I'm not sure I have the patience for that right now.
 PICARD / (continuing) And... sometimes the very old get along best with the very young.
 KAREEN / Is he in great pain?
 KAREEN / (sadly) He won't even let me get near him, now.
 RIKER / Has he been... like a father to you?
 KAREEN / More like a teacher.
 TROI / I sense that his feelings for you are very warm. He's attracted to you in many ways.
 KAREEN / Attracted?... I know -- I've felt certain feelings from him. But he's always been a gentleman. (to Riker) Had I been older... perhaps we could've been lovers. But nothing like that ever happened between us.
 KAREEN / (continuing) Now, it's like he's afraid to face me... The only one he talks to is your friend, Data.
 DATA / I have noticed Doctor, that you --
 DATA / I have noticed Grandpa, that you keep repeating the same notes of a musical passage that I am unfamiliar with.
 DATA / What happens to this man?
 DATA / A happy ending. The mechanical man got his wish.
 DATA / But... pain is unpleasant... is it not?
 DATA / Desire? It is to long for or crave, a wish, a request, a --
 DATA / No... I do not suppose I will ever know what it really is.
 DATA / (softly) Funny?... I have... difficulty discerning what is funny.
 RIKER / I just spoke with the captain. The Enterprise is minutes away; he'll contact us again when she goes into orbit.
 RIKER / Yes. Arrangements are being made to make his last days with us as comfortable as possible.
 KAREEN / It'll be strange to leave here.
 TROI / You're a beautiful young woman, and there's a whole universe waiting for you out there.
 KAREEN / I'll be alone. I'll be without Ira.
 WORF / (lowered tone) I know what it is to lose those closest to your heart. It will be hard... you will feel alone at first... but it will surely pass, as time passes. I know.
 DATA / You mentioned your impending death a while ago. I must say Grandpa, that you are facing it with remarkable courage and stoicism.
 DATA / (shocked) You condone homicide, sir?
 DATA / Really Grandpa?
 DATA / But... the doctor --
 DATA / Grim Reaper... Is that a farmer with no sense of humor?
 DATA / Well Grandpa, that is not necessarily true. I do have an "off button" if you like. Its activation robs me of all consciousness -- therefore rendering me dead for all intents and purposes.
 DATA / (continuing) It is not something I enjoy contemplating.
 RIKER / Welcome to Gravesworld, sir. This is Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves' friend and assistant.
 PICARD / I'm very sorry, Ms. Brianon. I'm sure this is quite difficult for you.
 KAREEN / Thank you, Captain. Your people have been most kind to me.
 PICARD / Where's Data?
 TROI / He's been with Doctor Graves almost the entire time. They seem to have developed a genuine rapport.
 PICARD / Hmm, I suppose I can understand that. (to Pulaski) I think we should immediately transport to the ship. There are patients from the Rogers who could use some of your medical savvy.
 PICARD / Nothing serious. (to Kareen) But I'd also like to get Doctor Graves to a place where we can make him more comfortable.
 DATA (O.S.) / That will not be necessary, Captain.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Explain yourself, Data.
 DATA / It happened in my arms, just a few moments ago. (pause) There is no need to hurry... Ira Graves is dead.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Supplemental. I leave Gravesworld with an empty feeling and the knowledge that our mission was unsuccessful. Whatever scientific secrets Ira Graves was about to unlock will follow him to his grave...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Our immediate priority is to reach the nearest starbase so that Graves' assistant and the marooned settlers can get on with their lives.
 PICARD / And he really believed he could transfer his intellect into a computer?
 DATA / That is correct. Unfortunately he never had the opportunity to elaborate. Death came swiftly.
 RIKER / Why didn't you notify Doctor Pulaski when it started to happen?
 DATA / To do so would have been pointless. There was nothing she could have done.
 DATA / I am not an "it," Doctor. You have been duly informed of this on several occasions, yet you continue to label me with that abhorrent pronoun.
 PICARD / Data... I realize you liked Doctor Graves a great deal.
 DATA / He was the greatest man I have ever known.
 PICARD / Does his death disturb you?
 DATA / Disturb, Captain? No. All things must pass. (pause) May I go now, sir?
 PICARD / Yes of course.
 DATA / We will try and do the funeral the way he wanted, will we not, Captain?
 PICARD / I told you we would, Data.
 DATA / I am glad, sir. It was his dying wish.
 RIKER / That's interesting.
 PICARD / Hmm?
 RIKER / I thought he said death came swiftly. When did Graves have time to make a dying wish?
 KAREEN / (gently, feminine) Hello Data. It's good to see you again.
 KAREEN / (continuing) The stars are so beautiful when seen from space. Yet they seem lonely -- each so isolated from the next.
 DATA / Ira... never told you how beautiful you were to him. He never told you that, did he?
 DATA / (continuing) He could not tell you, do you understand?
 KAREEN / Yes. I understand.
 DATA / But he wanted to. Every waking moment. (pause) And he wanted you to know that.
 KAREEN / Data! (pause) How do you know? How do you know... what he thought of me?
 DATA / He told me.
 WESLEY / Captain Picard.
 PICARD / What is it?
 WESLEY / (a bit hesitant) I heard about the ceremony you're having for Doctor Graves, and... well sir --
 PICARD / -- You wish to attend.
 WESLEY / (nodding) Since I never got to meet him...
 PICARD / I think it's a fine idea. Come along, Wes.
 DATA / ... The temperature should be seventy-two, no make it seventy-one degrees. And whenever the name Ira Graves is mentioned it will warm considerably --
 PICARD / Are we the first?
 DATA / You are the last. The others have congregated inside.
 PICARD / Very good. (to computer) Enter.
 DATA / (to Picard) Perhaps the child would be better off playing somewhere else. This is an adult ceremony after all.
 WESLEY / (laughing) The child? You still working on your sense of humor, Data?
 PICARD / You don't seem yourself lately. Are you feeling all right?
 DATA / Of course, sir. I am as healthy as a Rigellian ox.
 TROI / ... Although we hardly knew him, we certainly knew of him. His reputation spread throughout the galaxy, and his mind touched all who cherish science.
 TROI (O.S.) / We gather here today, to say a respectful good-bye to Ira Ellsworth Graves. A man who --
 DATA / This is not exactly what he wanted.
 RIKER / You programmed the setting. The field, the mountain range --
 DATA / -- It is not the environment that I question, Commander. This was one of his favorite places on Gravesworld.
 PICARD / Well what is it then?
 DATA / It is the tone, the pacing, the content of the verbal tribute. (to Troi) No offense Counselor, but Doctor Graves would have desired a slightly more personal address.
 RIKER / And how can you be so sure?
 DATA / Why he told me, of course. (to Picard) Perhaps I should take over, sir.
 PICARD / If you promise to be brief. When I agreed to this, I didn't intend for it to interfere with our duties. Understood?
 DATA / Perfectly.
 DATA / (continuing) Just look at that face. The face of a thinker, a warrior, a man for all seasons.
 DATA / Yes friends, Ira Graves was all that and more.
 DATA / Ira Graves was a great humanitarian.
 DATA / (continuing) To know know know him, was to love love love him. But Ira Graves was not perfect.
 PICARD / Data...
 DATA / (continuing, unaware) Perhaps his greatest fault was that he was too selfless. Cared too much for his fellow man.
 PICARD / Data! That's enough!
 DATA / I am almost finished sir.
 PICARD / You are finished, you mean.
 PICARD / What's become of your judgment?
 DATA / Perhaps I am maturing, sir.
 PICARD / Do you consider it mature to program the mountains to tremble every time you say the name, Ira Graves?
 PICARD / (continuing) Not to mention the air warming at the very thought of him. We would've been barbequed if we'd stayed much longer.
 DATA / I seem to have overdone it.
 RIKER / To put it mildly.
 DATA / I brought shame to this ship. To the good name of Starfleet.
 PICARD / Data --
 DATA / -- I was only trying to carry out his wishes. To make sure I kept my promise.
 PICARD / I know that Data.
 PICARD / (continuing) Look... I realize you've been studying the human equation with great alacrity, but maybe you've been trying just a little too hard. Do you know what I mean?
 PICARD / (continuing) Try and relax a little. Don't try to be so... "human." Just be yourself. Okay?
 DATA / (serious, just a touch of sadness) Affirmative, sir. I will work on staying within myself. Now if you will excuse me, I am due on the bridge.
 RIKER / I'm concerned, sir. I've never seen him act like this.
 PICARD / Could it be that grandfather analogy Graves planted in his head?. Data is an orphan in a manner of speaking. Maybe the loss of Graves really got to him. Touched him emotionally.
 RIKER / I hope that's all it is.
 PICARD / It's Captain Picard and Commander Riker. May we come in?
 PICARD / We've come to pay our respects, Miss Brianon.
 KAREEN / Thank you, gentlemen. That's most thoughtful.
 RIKER / We're due at Starbase Six in less than twelve hours. We thought you might enjoy a quick look at the bridge before we arrive.
 KAREEN / Can one see the stars from up there?
 PICARD / Oh yes. Closer than you've ever seen them before.
 KAREEN / I think I'd enjoy that very much.
 WESLEY / (grinning) That was a great speech, Data. To know know him is to love love love love love him?!
 DATA / (dry) Taken from a centuries-old Earth composition. Your child-like mind cannot appreciate the timeworn wisdom of its words.
 GEORDI / (teasing) You're not turning into a star-crossed artist on us, are you Data?
 DATA / I am many things: artist, scholar, lover, genius --
 GEORDI / You're getting funnier, I gotta hand it to you. (laughs, shakes head) There's something to be said for that deadpan delivery.
 RIKER / You're looking in the general direction of the constellation Pegasus.
 PICARD / I'm aware of your interest in science. Perhaps you'd like to --
 DATA / (under his breath) -- And I am aware of your interest in her.
 PICARD / (sharply) What was that, Data?
 DATA / Nothing sir. Nothing at all.
 PICARD / These are our science stations.
 WESLEY / (whisper) What's wrong with you?!
 DATA / (normal voice) I detest hypocrisy. I wish they would just come out and admit it.
 PICARD / (angry) Admit what, Mister Data?
 DATA / That your interest in Kareen is not entirely honorable.
 WORF / Data! You are way out of line!
 DATA / (to Picard) Try as you might, you cannot win her heart. She does not like older men... (to Riker) ... or men of limited intellect.
 PICARD / (controlling his temper) Mister Data, you are hereby relieved of duty -- Worf, take his station.
 WORF / Yes sir.
 PICARD / You will report to your quarters immediately. You will not leave there until you hear otherwise from me. Is that understood?
 DATA / Sure, I understand. (looks at Kareen) I understand all too well.
 DATA / (continuing) Removing the competition will not help you, Picard.
 PICARD / (to Kareen) Do you know what that was all about?
 TROI / (as a revelation) Jealousy... I sensed intense, burning jealousy. And it was coming from Data!
 GEORDI / I heard what happened but I just can't believe it.
 DATA / Do not trouble yourself, friend. I am sure the captain will be by to apologize shortly.
 GEORDI / You expect him to apologize?
 DATA / It seems I was too harsh on Soong. Notice the strong chin, the finely chiseled features, the powerful torso. Do you realize that this body will never wear out. (sighs with pleasure) Immortality.
 GEORDI / What the hell are you talking about?
 GEORDI / (continuing; to Picard) He's not himself, sir. I know him better than anybody.
 PICARD / (to Data) We're going to Sickbay.
 DATA / (aloof) Oh? Are you ill, sir?
 PICARD / I'm getting there. Come along.
 PICARD / Because I brought him to you. I want a complete medical check run on him immediately.
 PICARD / -- I expect nothing less.
 PICARD / I have the utmost faith in your abilities, Doctor. I know nothing will get by you.
 DATA / I am simply looking. Any thought of ulterior motive rests with you. Perhaps you are projecting your own desires.
 DATA / (shrugging) Very well. It is your loss.
 PICARD / Wait for me in the corridor, Mister Data.
 DATA / What for? This concerns me more than it does any of you.
 PICARD / (raising voice) You will wait for me in the corridor!
 PICARD / (continuing) His insubordination is growing by leaps and bounds. I could throw him in the brig but I'd rather try and help him.
 TROI / Perhaps we're looking in the wrong place, sir.
 PICARD / Explain.
 TROI / Well, Data's physical health may be unimpaired but it's his mental health that needs to be addressed.
 TROI / With your permission Captain, there's one way to find out.
 TROI / You remember the psychotronic stability examination, don't you Data? We all had to take it before graduating from the Academy.
 DATA / It was a waste of time then and it is a waste of time now.
 TROI / Just watch the screen and let your mind go blank. This little machine will do the rest.
 PICARD / It's safe to say you're his best friend. Can you speculate on what's happening to him?
 GEORDI / It's just a guess sir, but, well sometimes he wants to be human so bad he can taste it. And sometimes he is more human than he or we realize.
 PICARD / Yes...
 GEORDI / I think your theory might be right, Captain. Witnessing Graves' death may have been the catalyst --
 TROI / I have the results of the tests, Captain. I -- I ran two tests to make certain.
 PICARD / Make certain of what?
 TROI / (concerned) There are two distinct personalities within Lieutenant Commander Data.
 PICARD / What?! He's an android, that's not possible!
 TROI / Nevertheless it is true. The second personality is the dominant. It is unbalanced: brilliant but vain, sensitive yet paranoid. I believe it is also capable of extreme acts of violence.
 PICARD / (shocked whisper) So that's it...
 TROI / What was that, sir?
 PICARD / (lost in thought) Nothing. Go on.
 TROI / It seems to have an especially strong hatred of you, Captain. Or to a lesser degree, any authority figure. (pause) And worst of all, it's growing.
 PICARD / How do you mean?
 TROI / The alien persona is getting stronger -- gobbling up what's left of the original Data.
 TROI / If we don't find a way to stop it immediately, the Data we knew will be gone forever.
 PICARD / Where is he now, Counselor?
 TROI / I left him in his quarters. He still has orders not to leave.
 PICARD / Orders? Which personality will choose to obey my orders?
 PICARD / (to computer) Tell me -- where is Lieutenant Commander Data?
 DATA / Hello Kareen.
 DATA / (continuing) You know who I am, don't you?
 KAREEN / You're -- you're Data.
 DATA / You know who I am. Don't you.
 KAREEN / (whisper) Ira?...
 DATA / It is me, Kareen! I'm here -- I'm alive!
 KAREEN / How?
 DATA / The process worked! I turned Data off and transferred my consciousness into his frame.
 DATA / (continuing) Just look at me! Sleek, powerful, indestructable.
 DATA / (continuing) When I was a boy, other children knew I couldn't match them physically. They teased me -- bullied me. That's when I withdrew... Became an island.
 DATA / (continuing) But no one will ever bully me again. (shrugs, smiles) If they try, I'll simply break their necks.
 KAREEN / Don't talk that way, Ira. I've never known you to be violent.
 DATA / (laughs) I've never been capable of violence. But now I'm more than capable -- and I rather enjoy this new ability.
 WORF / Excuse me Data, but the captain would like to see you.
 DATA / Of course. (to Kareen) If you will excuse me, Miss Brianon.
 DATA / (continuing) You're just the type, aren't you? You'd beat me up if you could, but you can't. Not any more.
 KAREEN / Ira, no.
 DATA / Stay out of it! (to Guard) You're lucky I'm such a compassionate man. Now walk!
 DATA / (continuing) There's something I must do -- something they're forcing me to do. I'll come for you when my task is complete.
 KAREEN / (voice trembling) Ira... I don't understand... what's happening to you?
 DATA / Something wonderful. I feel no pain, no pain at all! And I'm immortal -- I'll never have to face death again. Think of the things I'll accomplish over the next thousand years!
 DATA / (continuing) I know what you're thinking, but there's no need to worry. I'll create an android body for you as well. We'll witness the end of infinity together.
 DATA / (continuing) Don't cry, Kareen. (pause, concerned) Don't you see, I can love you now. The way I've always wanted to. It wouldn't have been right then... I was too old for you, too weak. But now I can be everything you've ever wanted.
 KAREEN / Ira -- you're hurting me!
 DATA / (softly, dazed) I'll be back. Wait for me.
 WORF / Ohhh, what hit me?
 RIKER / Did Data do this?
 KAREEN / (nodding) But it's not really Data.
 PICARD / Yes. I realize that now.
 PICARD / (into com) Security alert -- all decks. Lieutenant Commander Data may be armed and dangerous. Use extreme caution and subdue. All phasers on stun.
 DATA / Well hello there. You all look like you could use a little vacation.
 DATA / Captain Picard -- I have ordered your people to vacate the bridge and they have refused. In an effort to save insignificant lives I will give you the opportunity to issue the same order. Otherwise, I will remove them my way.
 RIKER / (softly, to Picard) That phaser's set to kill, Captain.
 PICARD / Data. That's your best friend you're threatening. That's Geordi. You wouldn't harm him for the world, would you?
 DATA / (uncertain) Geordi?
 GEORDI / Yes Data. It's me.
 DATA / He's no friend of mine! I should kill him on the spot -- put him out of his blind misery.
 PICARD / You win -- no need to act rashly. Mister La Forge, you and the rest of the bridge crew will vacate immediately.
 DATA / I'll blast anyone who attempts to reenter.
 PICARD / You will make no attempt to recapture the bridge. Is that clear, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Yes sir. Evacuating now.
 DATA / Maybe I should shoot one in the back just to let you know I mean business.
 PICARD / What is it you want? Tell me!
 PICARD / (continuing) Kareen is with us! You want to talk to Kareen.
 DATA / Kareen? Are you there?
 KAREEN / Yes -- yes Ira. I'm here.
 DATA / They're all against me, Kareen. They want to drive me out of this body. To kill me!
 DATA / (continuing) We're going to a new world, my darling. A place where no one can ever touch us. Just hang on, and trust in me.
 RIKER / Riker to bridge, Riker to bridge. (pause, to Picard) It's no good. He deactivated the monitor.
 WORF / And that "unhealthy mind" is in total control of this ship.
 GEORDI / Yet he seems to have a purpose. He said something about going to a new world.
 RIKER / (to Kareen) Do you know what he meant by that?
 TROI / (to Kareen) Is there anything you can tell us about Ira Graves that will help us to understand?
 KAREEN / (distraught) He's a wonderful man. He's not like this --
 PICARD / -- He's taken over my ship! And I want her back! (pause) Are you going to help me?
 KAREEN / How can I help?
 PICARD / By rejecting him! By deflating his ego.
 TROI / Yes, he said he was doing this for you. Saying you want nothing to do with him might distract him long enough --
 KAREEN / -- I won't hurt him! He's sick, I won't help to destroy him.
 PICARD / It might be our only hope! He controls all life-support systems on this ship. He could start killing us like flies.
 KAREEN / (yelling, distraught) I can't do it, don't you understand?
 PICARD / Yes, I suppose I do understand.
 RIKER / Where are you going, Captain?
 PICARD / (grim, determined) To the bridge.
 RIKER / I can't let you do that, sir.
 PICARD / You have no choice, Number One. Should I fail to return I want you to attempt an external bridge separation. Get all of our people as far away from him as possible.
 PICARD / There's still some of Data inside. I know there is. If I can reach him, maybe we've still got a chance.
 DATA / I could've killed you. You know that, don't you?
 PICARD / I do know that. I also know you haven't killed anyone so far. I don't think you really want to.
 PICARD / (continuing) Where are we going?
 DATA / To the Aldebaran system. There's a planet there that suits my purpose.
 PICARD / Which is?
 DATA / Why should I tell you?
 PICARD / Because you're lonely. Because you want someone else to share your plans.
 DATA / I'll tell you... because I'm bored. I plan on building a fortress, with a laboratory of course. Those of your crew that I do not exterminate shall live there as our slaves. Kareen will never want for anything.
 PICARD / And what of Data? Your "grandson."
 DATA / (chuckles) What of him?
 PICARD / You took advantage of him.
 DATA / I did him a favor! I gave him life!
 PICARD / You killed him! You're nothing but a two-bit murderer!
 DATA / You call me a murderer?! I'll show you what murder is.
 KAREEN (O.S.) / (screaming) Stop it!
 KAREEN) / (continuing) You've become a monster.
 DATA / (worried, nervous) Don't say that, Kareen. He attacked me --
 KAREEN / -- And a liar as well.
 KAREEN / (continuing) I hate you. I despise you.
 DATA / (shocked, weak) Kareen... don't...
 KAREEN / You're not a man anymore! You're a pathetic little pile of machinery!
 DATA / Stop... please...
 KAREEN / The thought of ever living with something like you makes me sick.
 KAREEN / (continuing) I'd rather live alone! I'd rather make love to a computer!
 KAREEN / (continuing) Are you going to kill me too?
 DATA / You hate me... What can I do, what can I do?
 KAREEN / Leave that body. It doesn't belong to you.
 RIKER / Data! Data, can you hear me?
 DATA / May I ask you a question, Commander?
 RIKER / I think you just did.
 DATA / Quite correct. May I ask you another question after this one?
 RIKER / No questions. Just tell me a joke. The funniest joke in history.
 DATA / All right. There were twelve... starship captains, sitting on a fence --
 PICARD / -- I've heard more than enough to know you're you again.
 KAREEN / (sad half-whisper) He's in there. Ira put himself in the computer.
 PICARD / No Kareen. The real Ira Graves never left the planet.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42411.2. The Enterprise has been unexpectedly diverted to the Ramatis star system. The two sides of a bitter little planetary conflict have petitioned Starfleet to transport to their world a mediator they have mutually selected. Our orders are transportation only -- no interference, no responsibilities. It is a mission much to my liking.
 RIKER has the Command position. WESLEY has the Conn, / DATA is at Ops, n.d. CREWMEMBER at Tactical. The other / positions are occupied by n.d. crewmembers.
 RIKER / Reduce to half impulse.
 WESLEY / Reducing velocity to one-half impulse.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Come.
 PICARD / Ah, Number One. Look at this. Ever since we left the Lima-Sierra system, I have been puzzling over how the third planet could maintain such an orbit, when it is theoretically impossible, but consider this.
 RIKER / There's no degeneration?
 PICARD / Exactly!
 RIKER / Why?
 PICARD / I haven't got that worked out.
 RIKER / Perhaps this facsimile lacks mass.
 PICARD / Yes, somewhat, but if this is an accurate representation -- would it not explain what happened in that system?
 RIKER / (as he studies the display) Perhaps.
 PICARD / Well, not a matter of great moment -- just a knot I had to untie. Now... What was it you wanted to see me about?
 RIKER / Captain, we have arrived at Ramatis Three.
 PICARD / Ah -- well -- time to leave.
 RIKER / Standard orbit, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Standard orbit.
 RIKER / Data, you have the bridge.
 RIKER / I am still uncomfortable about your leading this away team.
 PICARD / This is not an away team in the strictest sense. I consider this more of a ceremonial function. For me not to go, could be construed a lack of respect, or that I do not regard the mission as significant. Transporter Room Five.
 RIKER / Considering the importance of this mission and the lives which are at stake... I don't want to do anything which would have a negative affect on this negotiation, however...
 PICARD / I appreciate your concern, Number One, but, I'm sure it will go quite smoothly.
 RIKER / We have come a great distance for this mediator.
 PICARD / They asked for the best and that person, from all reports, is Riva.
 RIKER / I've never heard of him.
 PICARD / I'm not surprised, he hasn't mediated for several decades.
 RIKER / That's a long time to be out of the saddle. Let's hope he's not rusty.
 PICARD / Yes, for all our sakes... let's hope Riva is at the top of his game.
 TROI and WORF are waiting. They step onto the / platform.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Coordinates have been input.
 PICARD / Very good, Lieutenant. Worry not, Number One -- this will be a simple ceremonial greeting, and right back to the Enterprise.
 RIKER / I'm sure.
 PICARD / Energize.
 RIKER / Captain, this is the Enterprise.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We have arrived safely, Number One, and for the most part, we've been ignored... ah...
 PICARD / ... some of the local citizenry are beginning to assemble. I'll keep you informed.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I would appreciate it.
 There are three of them... each a distinctive personality and physical archetype -- the SCHOLAR_ARTIST, the WARRIOR_ADONIS, a CULTURED WOMAN. / These "types" show no emotion, and if they are aware of the away team, they do not acknowledge them.
 TROI / (she responds with a smile, and a nod) Riva.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / eeennniYOO.
 TROI / He is a well-liked leader. Their affection is genuine, as is his.
 PICARD / Well, if they respect him on Solais, as much as they do here -- we could be looking forward to a successful mission.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / I've never seen anything like this before and I'm a little uncertain about how to proceed. (smiles) There is a wonderful feeling of well being, emanating from here.
 WOMAN / Please -- come closer.
 WOMAN / (continuing) Before I start, is there anything you need? Refreshments, food.
 PICARD / No. But thank you for asking.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Then -- (with a gesture to Picard) Proceed.
 PICARD / Greetings from the United Federation of Planets. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of the USS Enterprise. This is Counselor Troi, and Lieutenant Worf.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / GREETINGS!
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Welcome to Ramatis.
 WOMAN / I have been expecting you.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / You're empathic.
 TROI / Yes.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Then, although you already know my feelings toward you, allow me to put them into words. I am looking forward to this journey, now more than ever, because it gives me the chance to spend time in your company.
 TROI / (she speaks to Riva, not Warrior_Adonis) I am flattered. And I too, look forward to learning more about you.
 TROI / (quietly to Picard) There's a very different kind of communication here, Captain.
 PICARD / Yes, so I see. I think there are facets to Riva about which we were not informed.
 WOMAN / Precisely. It is a process which has developed over the centuries and one I find quite harmonious.
 PICARD / So Riva the famous mediator is... ?
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Deaf. (with great conviction) Born, and hope to die.
 PICARD / (indicating Chorus) And you all speak for Riva?
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / I not only convey his words, but his emotional intent as well.
 TROI / The members of the Chorus, serve as "translators," and each represents the archetypes of man's personality.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / I am the scholar. I represent the intellect. I speak in matters of judgment -- philosophy -- logic. Also, I am -- the dreamer. The part which longs to see the beauty beyond the truth which is always the first duty of art. I am the poet...
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Artists tend to ramble, they live too much in the future, they neglect the moment. I am Riva's libido. I am his passion. I am the anarchy of lust. The romantic -- the (with a little self-deprecating nod to Troi) ... lover. Also, I am as he. (indicates Worf) The definition of Riva's honor... the perfect line which never wavers.
 PICARD / (to the Woman) And you...
 WOMAN / I represent that part of Riva which binds all the others together. I am harmony -- wisdom -- balance.
 PICARD / (to the Woman) Remarkable. How did this...
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Speak to me!
 PICARD / What?!
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Speak directly to me!
 TROI / (so Riva cannot read her lips) He's prodding you to get a reaction.
 PICARD / (to Riva) The uniqueness of this presentation provoked my inadvertent breach in protocol. No insult was intended.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Then... none is perceived.
 PICARD / I was curious about how this unique form of communication came about.
 WOMAN / The gene for hearing is not present in our planet's ruling line.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Not that unusual, indeed it is similar to the English Tudor monarchs of your planet Earth, all who had hemophilia. Or the leaders of Fendaus Five, who were without limbs.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Throughout time, many of the galaxy's greatest contributors have been similarly "special."
 PICARD / (to Riva) Your ability to read lips -- is very impressive.
 WOMAN / Thank you.
 PICARD / Your "translators" do not see you, yet they are able to accurately convey your thoughts.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / My Chorus is so attuned -- they can "hear" my hands and translate to you. It is a relationship which has developed over centuries -- their ancestors provided the same service to my ancestors.
 TROI / Your way of communication is most distinctive, Riva.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / It takes a fine mind to appreciate that, Counselor Troi.
 TROI / (indicates Warrior_Adonis) This part of you does not seem to speak very often.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Only when the spirit moves me.
 PICARD / Riva -- if you are ready -- the situation at Solais Five is very critical. We should not delay.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / I will prepare for departure immediately.
 PICARD / Are you all -- I mean -- Riva, did you plan to take these people with you?
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / (challenging) Is that a problem?
 PICARD / No, it's just that we didn't know you would all be coming.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / (to Troi) How long will my journey to Solais take?
 TROI / More than two of your days.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / (Riva comes up and beside them) Then, until duty calls, this will indeed be a pleasant trip.
 WORF / With your permission, Captain.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 WORF / Enterprise, this is the away team, seven to beam up.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / The away team, plus four, is on board.
 RIKER / Acknowledged. Ensign, set your course for Solais Five.
 WESLEY / Course is set.
 RIKER / Velocity -- warp eight.
 WESLEY / Warp eight -- aye.
 RIKER / Engage, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Riva, may I present--
 RIKER / (indicating the Chorus) What's this?
 PICARD / These three -- speak for Riva.
 RIKER / You mean, the most respected negotiator in the Federation -- is deaf? Amazing.
 PICARD / This is my first officer, Commander Riker.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / It is an honor to meet you.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Commander Data.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / It is a pleasure to meet such a unique individual.
 DATA / Thank you...
 PICARD / And our chief medical officer, Katherine Pulaski.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Doctor.
 PICARD / This is Lieutenant La Forge.
 GEORDI / Pleased to meet you, sir.
 WOMAN / What is that you're wearing?
 GEORDI / A VISOR. It modifies the electromagnetic spectrum and carries the readings to my brain.
 WOMAN / And without it, can you see?
 GEORDI / No. Without it I'm as blind as a post.
 WOMAN / Your VISOR serves the same purpose as my Chorus, which "hears" my thoughts and translates them into sound.
 GEORDI / Yes.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / And you don't resent it?
 GEORDI / The VISOR or being blind?
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Either.
 GEORDI / They are both part of me, and since I like who I am, why would I resent either being blind or wearing the VISOR?
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / What is your position on this ship?
 GEORDI / Engineering officer, sir.
 WOMAN / (to Geordi) It's a blessing to understand we are special... (then including everyone) ... each in his own way.
 GEORDI / My feeling exactly.
 WOMAN / Please call me Riva.
 GEORDI / Okay. And you can call me Geordi.
 PICARD / I will have you shown to you quarters, then at your convenience I have prepared a briefing on the Solari wars? I offer the hospitality of my ship during this journey. We will provide whatever is necessary to make you comfortable or to facilitate your mission.
 WOMAN / Thank you.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Perhaps, if it is not inconvenient, Counselor Troi could escort me. (then to Picard) With your permission.
 TROI / This way.
 RIKER / What about you?
 WOMAN / At times like this -- we become an encumbrance.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / ... so if you have a room for us, we'll wait until Riva makes contact.
 PICARD / Exactly how will he do that?
 WOMAN / The headband that he wears -- it transmits his thoughts, and emotions to us.
 PICARD / So that's how it work.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / No magic -- just technology.
 PICARD / Worf, could you provide an escort.
 RIKER / He's not what I expected.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Much of what we do is similar.
 TROI / Yes -- I suppose in a way it is.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / We have both learned how to allow people to examine feelings hidden deep within their psyche. In fact, being here with you is provoking an emotional revelation.
 TROI / (lightly) You mean something I am doing is uncovering an emotion buried in your psyche.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Not that deep.
 TROI / Oh, exactly what are you feeling?
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Can't you tell?
 TROI / Some of it -- but...
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / I feel that soon, perhaps after the briefing by your captain, you will be hungry, and perhaps we could dine together and compare... experiences.
 TROI / I would like that.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / As will I.
 TROI / Will you... (meaning the translator) ... be with us?
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Until we find our own method of communication.
 TROI / I look forward to that time.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / As do I.
 PICARD / Commander Data, would you please update the situation.
 DATA / The factions on Solais Five are historical enemies. So many have died that both societies are on the verge of extinction.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Enough. Thank you, Captain, but there is no need to continue. The specific issues of the conflict have no relevance.
 RIKER / So none of the background we have prepared would be helpful in understanding why they continue to fight?
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / The portfolio will indicate that the conflict is over a piece of land, or wealth, or some other tangible asset. But, we both know that is not the case.
 RIKER / A war which has been fought for this long has become very personal.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Exactly. The basis for peace must also be personal.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / This is an historic confrontation. (to Data) Correct?
 DATA / The factions have been at war for fifteen centuries.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / What's changed?
 DATA / I do not know what you mean.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / They have been killing each other for a long time, now they want to talk peace. So something about this situation has changed. What's the new piece to the puzzle?
 PICARD / That piece of information could be very useful. Data.
 DATA / Unknown.
 RIKER / Perhaps they are running out of people to kill. In any case, for whatever reason -- peace is now preferred. That should make your job easier.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Well, if not easier, at least possible, because they are motivated.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / But it doesn't matter. I'll find something. I always do.
 PICARD / Always?
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / To date, I have never failed. Now, unless there is something else...
 PICARD / No. This is for your benefit.
 WOMAN / Then... thank you for your time and effort... if you'll excuse me...
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / I believe I have to get ready for a dinner appointment.
 PICARD / Then, by all means, meeting is adjourned.
 RIKER / Our mediator is very... (he pauses to pick the correct word) ... self assured.
 PICARD / Cocky is the word I would have used.
 RIKER / It's all right if he can deliver, and we'll know that soon enough.
 WESLEY / We are approaching Solais Five.
 RIKER / Half impulse.
 WESLEY / Slowing to one-half impulse.
 TROI / We have arrived.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Then we don't have much time.
 TROI / No.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / This has been very pleasant.
 TROI / For me as well. I'm impressed, by how you deal with what some would consider a handicap.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / It's not a handicap at all. Unless you mean having me here.
 TROI / I did not mean that specifically, but, yes, I would consider you a disadvantage.
 TROI / (continuing) How do we communicate? I can feel your emotions, but don't we need words?
 TROI / (continuing) I don't understand.
 TROI / (continuing) Is that dream?
 TROI / (continuing) Love.
 RIVA / (signing) Stronger. Like you mean it.
 RIVA / (continuing; signing) Butterfly.
 TROI / Is that a butterfly -- or is that desire?
 RIKER / Standard orbit.
 WORF / Captain!
 WORF / I'm reading laser activity in the Solari Solar System!
 RIKER / How concentrated is the activity?
 WORF / It is localized -- and very intense.
 RIKER / So much for the cease-fire.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / I can establish voice only.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard, commander of the Federation starship USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / (continuing) If you continue to violate the rules by breaking the cease-fire, I will abort this mission.
 PICARD / Riva is in charge of the summit. I command the ship that brings him. I will not endanger my ship under any circumstances.
 PICARD / (formal) I shall summon him for you.
 PICARD / (continuing) Get Riva now!
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Counselor Troi. Have Riva report to the bridge immediately.
 TROI / They need you on the bridge. Now!
 PICARD / The cease-fire has been broken.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / I'm sure I can resolve that. Put them on the viewscreen.
 PICARD / On viewscreen.
 WORF / The quality of the transmission is very poor.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / It is sufficient.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / (stands right behind Riva) Brothers! Your bravery as fighters is known, now you must demonstrate your courage in a new way -- cease hostilities -- allow us to meet.
 WORF / The laser fire has ceased.
 RIKER / But for how long -- these Solari don't seem likely candidates for peace.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / (to Picard) I will need to see a topographical overlay of the battle area in order to pick a site for the meetings. Then I will need your help in creating the proper setting.
 PICARD / We are here to provide whatever service is necessary.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / There -- beam us down to that hilltop and inform the factions to join us. The time for killing has come to an end.
 RIKER / Set phasers on stun.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / You won't need those.
 RIKER / I'm sure we won't.
 RIKER / (continuing) Energize.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Yes. This will do.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / It is important that we set this up properly.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Commander. If it be possible -- I would like torches -- there -- there - there -- and there.
 RIKER / (touches his communicator) Engineering, this is the away team.
 GEORDI / Yes, Commander.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We are going to need your help.
 GEORDI / Yes, I thought you might.
 RIKER / We are going to need torches -- head high. (to Riva) ... and what else?
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / I would like a table and chairs -- (he points) ... right here.
 RIKER / Describe it.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / Round, about three meters in diameter, and if possible made out of indigenous rock.
 RIKER / Did you copy that, Geordi?
 GEORDI / I did. There should be no problem replicating a table like that. I have the coordinates -- I'll send down the torches, and get right on the table.
 RIKER / How long before the emissaries arrive?
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / It shouldn't be too long.
 WORF / They are coming.
 RIKER / How long will it take for these negotiations?
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / From that question, you must think they will go quickly.
 RIKER / Actually, until this moment I never thought much about it at all.
 WORF / Commander.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / (to Worf and Riker) The first few minutes will be very tense. Please... (the Scholar_Artist turns and gives Riva a puzzled look, almost like they have a bad phone connection, then turns back and continues) ... ah... stay calm, and do not respond even if you are provoked.
 RIKER / (with a glance at Worf, who can be provoked by an ambiguous greeting) We will do our best.
 WOMAN / I am Riva.
 WOMAN / Be at ease. I commend you both. To come here shows not only courage, but wisdom. Please -- give this conference a chance.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / (to the leaders) I have no magic. You have been fighting all your lives. You know only...
 RIKER / Riva -- what is it?
 RIKER / (without hesitation) Enterprise -- beam us up. Now!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log.
 PICARD / So... communication between Riva and his Chorus was aided by this device. Without it...
 TROI / Without it, he is mute.
 PICARD / (to Riva) Can you fix it?
 PICARD / (continuing) Can it be fixed?
 TROI / We must calm him.
 PICARD / Lieutenant La Forge. See what you can learn about this. If it's possible to repair it, I need to know.
 GEORDI / Right away.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / This is astounding. Nothing like this has ever happened.
 PICARD / I need your help.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / But what can we do? It's Riva...
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / We don't know anything. We just say what he tells us.
 PICARD / We need to communicate with him.
 PICARD / (continuing) Surely you know sign language.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / No.
 WARRIOR_ADONIS / We've never needed it.
 PICARD / And he neither reads nor writes.
 WOMAN / He's never had to.
 SCHOLAR_ARTIST / Riva knows sign language. He learned it on a mission to the Plaeties system. The parties there were so paranoid they would not allow us to accompany him.
 WOMAN / Captain -- what's going to happen? I feel so strange. I've never been without him before... never. I feel like I'm losing my mind.
 PICARD / You'll be all right. Stay here. I'll send someone to look after you. Please... try to stay calm.
 PICARD / Riva knows sign language.
 DATA / Captain. There are just in the Federation, eighty-one different variations of signing.
 PICARD / (to Data) Find a way to communicate with him. (to Worf) Take him to Sickbay. Doctor do what you can.
 PICARD / (continuing) You are not alone. We will solve this together.
 PICARD / (continuing) If Riva does not mediate this summit successfully, the Solari will destroy each other.
 RIKER / But if he can't speak, and can't use his Chorus, he's useless. Captain, you should mediate.
 PICARD / It is not me they want. They believe in Riva. The problem is, he no longer believes in himself.
 PICARD / (continuing) Keep me posted of Riva's progress. I'll be in my quarters.
 RIKER / Yes sir.
 PICARD / We have to find a way to talk to him.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42111.8. We are monitoring increased military activity on Solais Five. I fear that we will be unable to keep the Solari from destroying themselves without Riva and still he is silent.
 RIKER / How's it going?
 DATA / I have eliminated all but five distinct forms of signing. I will learn them all.
 DATA / Computer. Show me gestural language -- designation M-nine.
 WORF / Interesting. A technique of communication which is both silent and covert. It could be very useful.
 DATA / As a language -- the use of gestures and hand signals pre-dates the spoken word in most cultures. The major exception being the Leyrons of Malkus Nine who actually developed a written language first.
 DATA / (continuing) Computer - continue presentation.
 DATA / (continuing) Increase.
 DATA / (continuing) Increase.
 DATA / (continuing) Increase.
 DATA / (continuing) Increase.
 TROI / He's very frightened. All his life he's been in control. For once, he doesn't have the answers.
 TROI / Which means?
 TROI / (to Riva) Let's see how Geordi is coming.
 GEORDI / I've never seen anything like this before. It transmits Beta waves, but I can't figure exactly how. I wish I had thought to run a test while it was still functioning.
 TROI / (to Riva) Can you help?
 GEORDI / If he could tell me anything, anything at all.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Well, I'll continue to work on it.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I know what you must be going through. I can imagine what it would be like to lose my VISOR. But... we'll find something. Don't give up.
 TROI / Too late. I think he already has.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / How is our mediator?
 TROI / The same. Unreachable.
 PICARD / What can we do to help him?
 TROI / I can't do anything. It's up to him. Confidence is faith in oneself, it can't be given by another.
 PICARD / You're right, of course.
 PICARD / (continuing) Come.
 DATA / Captain, I have reviewed and stored five distinct signing languages.
 DATA / This is blue. This is a blue ocean. This is a blue ocean at sunset. This is two people walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is two happy people in love walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is --
 PICARD / Enough! (beat) Let's talk to Riva.
 PICARD / Good news. Data has learned your language. He can translate for you at the summit.
 DATA / (translating) It will not work. I need my words.
 DATA / (continuing; translating) There -- that is what I mean. Your translation is literal. You say words. I do not need just words -- I need nuance, and subtlety... the shadings my Chorus enable me to communicate.
 PICARD / But your ability is unchanged. All that's different is the method of transmission.
 DATA / (translating) No! I cannot!
 TROI / (softly) It's not working. Go another direction.
 PICARD / Data can understand you. Use him as your Chorus. Let him express your words.
 DATA / (translating) No -- it is not the same thing. Data is unacceptable...
 PICARD / You've got to take advantage of what you've got...
 DATA / (translating) What I have got. I have got nothing. Do you not understand - I cannot do it.
 PICARD / You're right. Maybe you are all show.
 PICARD / (continuing) You hide behind your Chorus. (in his face) You're a fake.
 DATA / (translating) You are attempting to provoke me.
 DATA / (continuing; translating) It is not going to work.
 PICARD / That's too bad. A lot of people are going to die.
 PICARD / Data.
 PICARD / We will return you to Ramatis.
 PICARD / (continuing) ... but, first I am going to attempt to settle the conflict on Solais.
 DATA / (translating) You.
 PICARD / We have come this far -- it would be difficult for me personally to leave without making the attempt.
 DATA / (translating) It could be dangerous.
 PICARD / Help me.
 DATA / (translating) How?
 PICARD / We all earn our reputations. Yours is that of a very successful negotiator -- a mediator.
 DATA / (translating) And you want to know the trick.
 PICARD / If there is one - yes.
 DATA / (translating) Captain, there is no secret. What I do is help one person -- one group -- express themselves to the other.
 PICARD / Simple enough to say - difficult to accomplish.
 DATA / (translating) The real trick is getting them to listen. To understand. To turn a disadvantage to an advantage.
 PICARD / Then why can't you turn your disadvantage into an advantage?
 DATA / (translating) That is an interesting thought... (to Picard) I do not understand -- what thought is he referring to?
 DATA / (continuing, translating) Thank you.
 PICARD / I will contact those down on the planet. Tell them to prepare to begin discussions immediately.
 PICARD / Set phasers on stun.
 PICARD / (continuing) Energize.
 DATA / (speaking for Riva) Could you relight the torches, to let them know that I am back.
 DATA / (continuing to speak for Riva) I would like the table right here.
 PICARD / (to Data) Make it so.
 DATA / (touching his communicator) Main Engineering, this is Commander Data.
 GEORDI / Go ahead, Data.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / You can beam the table down now.
 PICARD / It could be a while before the emissaries arrive. They will be more cautious after the last incident.
 DATA / (speaking for Riva) You can leave whenever you choose. I will get a message out when I am ready to leave. (to Picard as Data) Captain -- I do not understand what is going on here? Without his interpreters, how can he mediate?
 PICARD / Riva is going to teach them sign language.
 DATA / (speaking for Riva) Yes -- it is turning a disadvantage into an advantage. Learning how to sign will actually become part of the process of them learning how to live together in peace.
 PICARD / As they learn how to communicate with Riva, they will be learning to communicate with each other.
 DATA / (speaking for Riva) ... and that is the first and most important step in any relationship. (to Picard as Data) Captain, although it took me only moments to learn sign language, it will take them months.
 PICARD / Time well spent.
 DATA / (speaking for Riva) These people have been fighting all their lives, they know only hatred, suspicion, fear. Even with my Chorus -- I could not have changed those attitudes in a day. We have a chance, and they want the talks to be successful or they would not have called me.
 PICARD / Enterprise -- two to beam up. (to Riva) Good luck.
 DATA / (translating for Riva) And to you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42111.8. Personal comment. I am confident that Riva can help the Solari achieve a lasting peace. We will deliver his Chorus to Starbase Seven-One-Three so they can be returned to Ramatis.
 RIKER / Take us out of orbit.
 PICARD / Come.
 GEORDI / Sir?
 PICARD / Yes, Mister La Forge, something on your mind?
 GEORDI / Sir, I know my VISOR gives me a unique way of seeing that's valuable to the ship, but if something happened and I didn't have it --
 PICARD / What makes you unique isn't your blindness or your VISOR -- (searching for the words) To be special we don't need to do a damned thing. Just be what we are. (beat) There's only one Geordi La Forge. And I wouldn't want to run my ship without him.
 GEORDI / All right! (more controlled) I mean, thank you sir.
 PICARD / Dismissed.
 GEORDI / I'll think about it.
 RIKER / Set course, two-two-four, mark, three-nine.
 WORF / What is our destination?
 PICARD / Alpha Delta Beta. A routine transport mission.
 DATA / I thought this was supposed to be a routine transport mission.
 PICARD / Engage!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42303.7. The Enterprise is bound for Star Station India to rendezvous with a Starfleet courier.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Hopefully the mission will provide an opportunity to evaluate our newest staff officer...
 PICARD (V.O.) / In the short time she's been aboard, Doctor Pulaski has distinguished herself as a meticulous and competent physician. But can someone so focused on her own specialty also assume the broader duties of the ship's Chief Medical Officer?
 RINA / ... warp drive theory always came easy for me, but I'm looking forward to some hands on experience.
 RIKER / I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate you.
 GEORDI / I know what you mean. It's a really electrifying experience to be down there where the action is. Whenever I push the drive past warp six I still get a lump in my throat.
 RIKER / (standing) Can I get you another?
 RINA / Tell me Commander. Is it the custom on the Enterprise for the First Officer to wait on trainees?
 RIKER / (smiling) If they were all like you, I'm certain it would be.
 GEORDI / (to Rina) What's it like these days at the academy? Is Tsiolkovski still teaching Propulsion Theory?
 RINA / Are you kidding? They'll have to tear down the building around him. The first time I saw him...
 RIKER / Same again.
 RIKER / (turning) My apologies, Doctor. A minor crisis... (beat) in Engineering.
 RIKER / It's not that! It's just... my duties are so diverse. (beat) Suppose we leave the appointment open?
 RIKER / But it's just an unimportant detail...
 RIKER / You can't be -- (beat) I'll work something out. But my schedule is tight for the next three or four days...
 RINA / Beautiful, isn't it?
 GEORDI'S POV -- He "sees" the ship's navigational / shield as a gossamer scrim of shimmering color, and beyond, countless waves of energy bursting from exploding suns.
 GEORDI / The most beautiful thing I know.
 PICARD / (to com panel) Picard.
 PICARD / (to com panel) Sound emergency stations, and respond on the same frequency.
 WE FOLLOW as he stops at the food slct, grabs a cup of tea, and moves to replace the n.d. crewmember at the CONN. / 
 Picard is on his feet with Riker and COUNSELOR TROI next to him. COMMANDER DATA is at the OPS station and WORF is at TACTICAL. / 
 PICARD / Stand by, Doctor. Commander Data. Have we locked on to the signal yet?
 DATA / Yes, sir. A voice only transmission from the USS Lantree, a Federation supply ship.
 PICARD / (to viewscreen) Lantree, this is Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. What is the nature of your emergency?
 DATA / Sir, we are still recieving their signal. There is simply no message.
 PICARD / (to viewer) Lantree! Are you under attack?
 PICARD / (to com panel) USS Lantree, this is the Enterprise, come in, Lantree.
 PICARD / Replay that last transmission.
 PICARD (CONT.) / (to Troi) Counselor?
 TROI / Great stress is all I'm able to sense.
 RIKER / Have we got a fix on her?
 DATA / Two point two milli-parsecs, bearing three-zero at one-four- five degrees.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Number One?
 RIKER / We better take a look. (to Data) What vessel is it?
 DATA / USS Lantree, a class R Starfleet supply ship assigned to Gamma seven seven, Captain L.I. Taleka commanding. Normal complement, twenty-six officers and crew.
 RIKER / Armed?
 DATA / Class three defensive only.
 RIKER / Is she still underway?
 DATA / Indeed. She is at maximum speed.
 PICARD / Alter course to intercept.
 WESLEY / (enters course) Course to intercept.
 RIKER / Execute. (to Worf) Let's go to Yellow Alert.
 WORF / Yellow Alert, sir.
 RIKER / Engineering?
 GEORDI / Engineering.
 RIKER (V.O.) / (from com panel) Give us maximum warp.
 GEORDI / Maximum warp, sir. (to crew) Let's show 'em what we've got.
 GEORDI (CONT.) / (to Rina) Go to the backpanels and give me a direct reading of the dilithium temperature spread.
 GEORDI / What happened?
 GEORDI / (pained) Ensign... maybe you better stay in the control room.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / Lantree, this is the Enterprise.
 PICARD (CONT.) / Captain Telaka, this is Picard, USS Enterprise. Do you read me?
 DATA / No life signs, Captain.
 PICARD / Nothing?
 DATA / Nothing, sir.
 WORF / This could be an ambush.
 RIKER / Force fields up. Arm photon torpedoes.
 WORF / Force fields up.
 RIKER / Red alert.
 RIKER (cont.) / What else have we got in the neighborhood?
 WESLEY / No other vessels of any kind within two parsecs.
 PICARD / No battle damage.
 DATA / All systems seem functional, Captain. Everything is in perfect order.
 PICARD / And no life signs.
 DATA / No life signs.
 PICARD / We're going to have to board her, Will.
 RIKER / The only way we can wind up in the same starfield is if you bring us out of warp speed at precisely the same instant as the Lantree.
 GEORDI / First I have to get control of the her engines. Very tricky.
 RIKER / That's why we gave you the job. (friendly pat) Let me know as soon as you're set.
 GEORDI / Will I be on the away team?
 RIKER / (aware of Rina) Too dangerous for a valuable man like you. (smiles) Fortunately, first officers are expendable.
 RIKER (cont.) / Just in case we don't make it back... (kisses her hand) It was a pleasure.
 GEORDI / I'll man the bridge station. Our first problem is to gain control of the Lantree's drives. (to Rina) Come on. You'll get a chance to see what the bridge is like on alert.
 GEORDI / Ready to give it a try, Captain.
 GEORDI / First we have to download the Starfleet access codes for the Lantree... (punches buttons)
 PICARD / (smiling) Ensign?
 RINA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Perhaps you'd like to take a look from down here. (indicates the area in front of the  viewscreen)
 RINA / Thank you, Captain.
 RIKER / We're going in amidships protected by an isolation forcefield. We'll take one quick look. Fifteen seconds. If we don't like what we see, we beam back immediately.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / (from com panel) We have a lock on the Lantree, Commander.
 RIKER / (to com panel) Okay, let's drop out of warp speed. And see if you can keep us in the same galaxy.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / (from com panel) Sorry about that. We got as close as we could.
 RIKER / That's okay, Geordi. What's a light year among friends?
 RIKER / If it looks secure at first glance, we'll proceed to the bridge. (beat) If we find anyone alive, the medical team will beam over.
 WORF / Set phasers for kill.
 RIKER / Let's do it.
 DATA / I have the ship's logs, sir.
 RIKER / Let's see if anbody's home.
 RIKER / What is it?
 RIKER / How's the environment?
 DATA / No abnormal viral or bacterial forms.
 RIKER / They were carrying passengers?
 DATA / He is not a passenger. He is a crewmember.
 RIKER / But he's nearly two hundred years old!
 DATA / It would seem they all are.
 RIKER / How old was Captain Telaka?
 DATA / Thirty-two earth years.
 RIKER / Enterprise... this is the USS Lantree.
 PICARD / (from viewscreen) Enterprise here.
 RIKER / Captain, the entire crew has been wiped out.
 PICARD / What happened?
 RIKER / It looks like they were in a battle with time, and lost.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (from com panel) How soon will you have an autopsy report, Doctor?
 PICARD / Natural causes? What in nature could kill an entire crew at the same time?
 DATA / Sir, according to the Lantree logs the oldest crew member was seventy-three, and the mean age of the crew was thirty-two point six six.
 PICARD / Doctor?
 TROI / Nothing since then? No geriatric symptoms reported?
 PICARD / Thelusian flu?
 RIKER / If we don't know what we're looking for, how can we be certain the Lantree is safe?
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf. You know what to do.
 WORF / (standing) Sir.
 DATA / Captain, the Lantree's last port of call was three days ago. The Darwin Genetic Research Station on Gagarin Four.
 PICARD / (frowning) I was thinking of a quarantine.
 PICARD / You'll con --
 PICARD / Number One. Set course for Gagarin Four. Warp nine. We'll depart the moment our security officer returns.
 WORF / (to com panel) Codename Firestorm. Access A-D- three-three-two-four-nine.
 WORF / Set auto-destruct. Twenty second delay.
 WORF / Energize.
 GEORDI / Find it?
 RINA / All set. It was the sensor contact.
 GEORDI / (overlapping) -- sensor contact. (smiling) Just like you said it would be. Let's get it back in the panel and do a quick line test.
 RINA / Yes, sir!
 GEORDI / (to Rina) Come with me.
 GEORDI / Running the Engineering Section is no different than running the drive system. I've got to keep everything in balance. To get maximum efficiency out of --
 RINA / Don't bother, I've heard it all before. It's not your problem, anyway. It's me.
 GEORDI / That's right. You've got plenty of aptitude, but you're attitude's not makin' it.
 RINA / What do you know about my attitude? How'd you like it if people always behaved as if you're some kind of freak?!
 GEORDI / (tapping his VISOR) What do you think this is? My ticket to success?
 RINA / Wait. (withdraws her hand) I'm... sorry. Maybe I'm the one who's blind.
 GEORDI / What you are is maybe the most talented engineer to come out of the Acadamy since... well since me. Doing this job's in your blood. Now all we've got to do is convince the rest of 'em. (extends his hand) Deal?
 RINA / (shakes his hand) Deal.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / (to viewscreen) Darwin Station. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise, on course for Gagarin Four.
 MANDEL / (from viewscreen) Enterprise, this is Darwin Station. I'm Doctor Mandel. We've just declared a state of emergency here. We need your help, but you must stand off.
 MANDEL / (from viewscreen) To whom am I speaking, please?
 MANDEL / Katherine Pulaski? "Linear Models of Viral Propagation?"
 MANDEL / And still the standard. (a wave of relief) I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances, but I can't imagine anyone I'd rather be dealing with.
 MANDEL / Rapid onset of geriatric phenomena. One hundred percent fatal in the advanced stages.
 MANDEL / Acute arthritic inflammation. Pervasive and virtually instantaneous.
 MANDEL / Our research, here, is limited to human genetics. I assure you we're not dealing with some mutated pathogen that "got away from us." We believe the infective agent was introduced by a supply ship that was here three days ago.
 PICARD / Doctor, we encountered The Lantree a few hours ago. (beat) They lost all hands.
 MANDEL / That would seem to confirm our analysis. Were you able to establish a pathology?
 PICARD / Doctor Mandel! Did you hear what I said? The twenty-six men and women aboard the Lantree are all dead!
 MANDEL / I heard you Captain! And the prognosis is alarming. But my immediate concern is the children.
 MANDEL / We have thirty-two children here. They've been kept in positive isolation since the onset, and so far they've shown no symptoms. You must evacuate them as soon as possible.
 PICARD / (grave) I'm sorry. We'll lend any assistance we can, but I won't risk the lives of --
 MANDEL / Doctor Pulaski... you've got to convince him. (beat) These children are more than our progeny. They represent all our years of advanced genetic research. If he can't think of humanity, think of science!
 PICARD / I heard you Doctor. And I understand completely. We'll reach Gagarin Four in a little over three hours. Until then.
 WORF / I recommend against contact, Captain.
 PICARD / Number One?
 RIKER / I agree, sir. I wish there was something we could do, but the risk is too great.
 PICARD / Doctor?
 WORF / If they're infected... ?!
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / Doctor Mandel clearly believes the children are safe, but she isn't telling us the whole truth. I recommend caution.
 RIKER / Until we know what we're facing --
 PICARD / We're always at risk, Doctor. You may proceed with your examination, but I shall demand positive proof that these children are harmless before placing the lives of my crew in jeopardy.
 WESLEY (V.O.) / Approaching Gagarin Four on impulse power, Captain.
 PICARD / (to com panel) Thank you, Mister Crusher. Standard orbit.
 WESLEY (V.O.) / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / Containment forcefield ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Activate.
 MANDEL (O.S.) / (from com panel) You have the coordinates. We have one male and one female, standing by.
 GEORDI / (to com panel) Transporter, energize.
 WORF / A trick!
 RIKER / (to com panel) Transporter room. Reverse the trans --
 PICARD / Hold on that, Number One. Whoever they are, they're in stasis. Lieutenant Worf?
 WORF / The styrolite's intact, Captain.
 TROI / Captain, I... (beat) There's a definite presence -- two distinct personalities. Even in stasis... It's quite strong. (beat) They are unquestionably telepathic.
 DATA / Earth humans. Somewhat larger than normal. Approximately twenty years old --
 PICARD / (controlled) Or at least Doctor Mandel's vision of it.
 PICARD / Are you absolutely certain they're safe?
 PICARD / But how can we be --
 PICARD / Then until we can answer that question, we can't --
 PICARD / But the risk. The risk is --
 PICARD / (to com panel) Commander Riker, assemble the bridge crew in the observation lounge in fifteen minutes. Doctor Pulaski has a proposal she'd like us to consider.
 RIKER (V.O.) / (com panel) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / And Doctor... I'm not one to discourage input, but I'd appreciate it if you'd at least let me finish my sentences once in a while.
 TROI / Of course.
 TROI / Why do you say that?
 TROI / It takes time to get to know him. But he's very fair, and he has excellent judgment.
 TROI / (puzzled) Kate, I don't think he would be where he is if he couldn't see the "whole canvas."
 TROI / Maybe your problem is that the two of you aren't all that different.
 TROI / Let's just say you're both well established personalities.
 PICARD / Doctor Pulaski's studies indicate the children are harmless. She believes the rest of the colony's children should be beamed aboard and transported to a new environment while there's still time to save them.
 RIKER / Are you sure they're safe?
 WORF / You would risk yourself?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) I don't like it. If we lost the force field for some reason... we could lose the ship.
 PICARD / As Geordi says, forcefields can fail. And until --
 PICARD / You say you understand, Doctor, but I wonder if you do.
 PICARD (CONT.) / If you can find a way to prove the children are biologically harmless without risking the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist.
 TROI / Captain?
 PICARD / I'm concerned about our CMO. (off Troi's look) She's absolutley obsessed with the medical viewpoint. She doesn't seem able to step back and see the overall picture.
 TROI / Nothing, Captain. Perhaps you and the CMO just need to give each other a little more time.
 MANDEL / (from viewscreen) Doctor? Do you have a decision?
 MANDEL / How can that be?!
 MANDEL / But the children were never on the Lantree! (beat) You can't do this! For God's sake! I demand that you do something to save our children.
 MANDEL (CONT.) / (spreads her withered hands.) We haven't much time.
 RINA / What's the it?
 GEORDI / (glances up) Our error rate is up nearly forty percent.
 RINA / You mean: since I came aboard.
 GEORDI / The problem is, there's no area on the ship that can be sealed off with absolute certainty.
 RINA / The Sickbay has independant systems, but it's not possible to totally cut it off from the rest of the ship. The only truely independent environment would be the shuttlecraft, or something like --
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / (studies her) And you along with it.
 PICARD / Doctor, you are the chief medical officer of the Starship Enterprise. You have a responsibility to this ship --
 PICARD / The Starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined --
 PICARD / Request approved.
 PICARD / Doctor, I can't condone the jeopardy you're assumming, but I recognize that you have satisfied my conditions.
 DATA / Doctor? You sent for me?
 DATA / Certainly. I was trained at --
 RIKER / Doctor, what's going on?
 RIKER / The captain approved this?
 RIKER / Doctor, I can't allow you to risk yourself like this. (to com panel) Captain, this is Riker --
 RIKER / What does that... (dawning realization) You can't be serious.
 RIKER / (to com panel) Computer -- override shuttle operations! Halt departure! Secure the shuttle!
 DATA / Begin shuttlecraft launch sequence.
 DATA (V.O.) / Stand by to open shuttle bay doors.
 RIKER / (resigned) Good luck, Doctor.
 DATA / We are in position, Doctor.
 DATA / And if they are not?
 DATA / That is by no means certain, Doctor, but I was referring to you.
 DATA / All within tolerance, Doctor.
 PICARD / (from viewscreen) Doctor!
 PICARD / (from viewscreen) Good lord!
 WORF / Transporter set to original coordinates, Captain.
 PICARD / Energize. (noticing Riker) Glad you're here, Number One.
 PICARD / (on viewscreen) We'll have a medical team waiting for you in the shuttle bay, Doctor.
 PICARD / Doctor!
 WORF / Captain, I'll see to the decontamination myself.
 DATA / How do you feel?
 DATA / Set course for Darwin Station?
 PICARD / I wish it were that simple, Will.
 RIKER / A meaningless detail on a medical form...
 PICARD / I agree it seems insignificant,
 RIKER / You have the authority to countermand it.
 PICARD / My authority flows from the chain of command. If you, or any other officer, have anything less than full confidence that your orders will be carried out, then my rank of Captain is meaningless.c
 RIKER / (beat) Sir, if there's any way I can help get them back...
 PICARD / Of course.
 WESLEY (V.O.) / (from com panel) Captain, Shuttle One is decending to Gagarin Four.
 PICARD / (to com panel) Thank you, Mister Crusher. (to the group) The medical emergency at Darwin Station is ongoing. We'll continue to assist, but our immediate concern is the evacuation of our two officers. Anyone?
 TROI / Shouldn't Kate be involved in this?
 PICARD / Judging from what we saw on the Lantree, Doctor Pulaski may not be able to help herself.
 TROI / (beat) I suggest transporting them both back to the ship. We should use whatever time we have to seek the best medical resources available.
 RIKER / The transporter won't protect us. The children went through the transporter and still infected Doctor Pulaski.
 GEORDI / The bio-filter can be adjusted. We could alter the filter to screen out whatever it is that's causing...
 PICARD / Precisely. We can't protect ourselves against the unknown. What we need is a filter that isn't bio-dependent.
 RINA / What about the "trace?"
 RIKER / The transporter trace?
 RINA / The transporter keeps a computer record of every transmission, a footprint if you will. Usually it's only stored for security purposes, but if we used the trace data to control the reconstitution process...
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Is that possible?
 GEORDI / I hate to admit it, but it never occured to me. All I can tell you is she hasn't been wrong yet.
 PICARD / Very well. Thank you Ensign... ?
 TROI / Excuse me, Captain. But where will we get the trace data? As far as I know Kate's never used the transporter.
 PICARD / Never?
 RIKER / She's... a woman of strongly held opinions, sir. (beat) What about a previous assignment?
 TROI / Her last ship was the Repulse.
 PICARD / (to com panel) Bridge. Signal the USS Repulse on the sub-space captain's priority channel.
 MANDEL / (extends her hand) Doctor Pulaski... (beat) I can only tell you how much I regret the burden we have imposed on you. (a glance at Data) On both of you.
 MANDEL / I still can't believe the children had anything to do with this.
 DATA / (gestures toward Pulaski) The evidence is fairly conclusive.
 MANDEL / But the children were designed to ward off any disease agents.
 MANDEL / (looks down) Our ultimate achievement.
 MANDEL / Created! (beat) Perfect in every way. Better than perfect. Their bone structure, their musculature... (gestures) their brains!
 MANDEL (V.O.) / That was our masterpiece. An aggressive immunity that attacks any invader and destroys it genetically.
 MANDEL / Thelusian flu?
 MANDEL / By altering the genetic pattern. Forcing the virus into extinction.
 MANDEL / We were so concerned about protecting them -- we overlooked the obvious! (beat) The one decision we made with our hearts... turns out to be a mistake.
 PICARD / Tell me, Taggart. If she served you as well as you say, why did you let her go?
 PICARD / (shocked) Extraordinary.
 MANDEL / But the computer run could take months.
 DATA / (points to display) Comparing genetic samples indicates a transposition of these two proteins.
 MANDEL / It appears that the antibodies have been too effective.
 DATA / I believe she is referring to the fact that the human genome is self replicating.
 MANDEL / He's quite right. Every cell in our bodies is now programmed for extinction.
 PICARD / Have you made any progress, Doctor Pulaski?
 PICARD / (incredulous) I'm sure, but right now I'm concerned about you.
 PICARD / (from viewscreen) No, Doctor. You and Commander Data belong here.
 PICARD / (from viewscreen) Doctor...
 DATA / I am sorry I could not be more helpful, Doctor Pulaski.
 DATA / Doctor --
 DATA / Enterprise. Commander Data ready to beam aboard.
 WESLEY / Sir. Commander Data is back aboard.
 TROI / Jean-Luc, don't try to carry all the weight for this tragedy. Kate knew what she was doing.
 PICARD / (angry) If I was certain we had tried absolutely every -- (he's thinking) Stand by.
 MEDIC / No life forms present.
 PICARD / Good to see you, Data.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Tell me quickly -- you were unaffected because you have no genetic material?
 DATA / Correct, sir.
 PICARD / And Doctor Pulaski's DNA is altered -- and that's what brings on the aging?
 DATA / Precisely. An almost undetectable transposition in the human genome. It takes a number of interactions of the --
 PICARD / Come on. We've got one more card to play.
 GEORDI / Sir?
 PICARD / Ensign, I need your opinion.
 RINA / (taken aback) Sir?
 PICARD / You said the transporter could be altered to filter out changes in Doctor Pulaski.
 RINA / If we'd had the trace...
 PICARD / Well it turns out the changes are in her DNA. If we used a sample of the doctor's DNA -- say from a blood test -- that was taken before --
 RINA / Could we filter out her genetic alterations? Absolutely!
 PICARD / You're picking up some bad habits, Ensign, but yes, you took the words right out of my mouth. (beat) Can you make the modifications?
 RINA / Of course!
 PICARD / Make it so.
 GEORDI / (smiles) Hop to it Ensign. You've got work to do.
 PICARD / Darwin Station, this is the Enterprise.
 PICARD / (to viewscreen) We may have come up with an answer, Doctor. We're looking for a sample of your normal DNA to use as a filter. We think we'll be able to transport you while cancelling out any changes that have taken place.
 MANDEL / Kate. (beat) If this works -- we may be able to use the same technique to save ourselves. We have DNA samples.
 RIKER / A blood test or tissue specimen -- anything that would provide a sample of Pulaski's original DNA.
 DATA / Afraid not, sir. Her records were shipped by way of Starfleet headquarters. They haven't caught up with us yet.
 RIKER / This is ridiculous. (slams his fist) A single cell! A single --
 RIKER / (to com panel) This is an emergency! Unlock Medical Officer Pulaski's quarters!
 DATA / (embarrassed) Allow me, sir.
 RIKER / Anything! Even a fingernail clipping! (looks at Data) Or a hair!
 PICARD / Doctor... you should know. This has never been done before. Are you willing to chance it?
 RINA / Ready, Captain.
 WORF / The isolation forcefield is in place.
 PICARD / (beat) I'll operate the transporter myself.
 WORF / That's not necessary, sir.
 PICARD / I'm afraid it is. If something should go wrong. If Doctor Pulaski is not fully... restored.
 RIKER / (understanding) Then she's still capable of contaminating the ship.
 PICARD / (nods) In that event there should be time to redirect the transporter and... disperse her. It's not a responsibility I can delegate.
 GEORDI / Don't worry, Captain. It's not going to come to that.
 PICARD / You seem to have absolute faith in the ensign's work.
 GEORDI / (glances at Rina) Like I said, she's never wrong.
 PICARD / Very well, then. (to com panel) Engage forcefield.
 PICARD (Cont.) / (to com panel) Doctor Pulaski, are you ready?
 RIKER / Captain...
 PICARD / Welcome aboard, Doctor.
 RIKER / Doctor... I'm ready to take the Rheinman test.
 PICARD / (clears his throat) It would have been necessary to beam your energy into empty space. (beat) Happily, there's no reason to concern yourself with --
 GEORDI / Looks like you'll be going to your next assignment with a captain's commendation in your record.
 RINA / Thanks to you. And the way you... see things. (turns to him) Tell me. When you look at me, what do you see?
 GEORDI / To me beauty is a constantly changing thing. Sometimes people have it and sometimes they don't. It all depends on their energy. (beat) I see your energy and it's beautiful. But it comes from within.
 RINA / You're the only poetic chief engineer I've ever heard of.
 GEORDI / And you're the most able trainee I've ever met. (kisses her hand) To quote our first officer, "It's been a pleasure."
 RINA / Technically, I'm off duty.
 GEORDI / (beat) Technically, so am I.
 RINA / Maybe you'd like to come in. I've got a fabulous collection of antique star drive drawings.
 GEORDI / Sounds riveting.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Course and speed set for Star Station India, Sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Engage.
 WESLEY is at the Conn. WORF is at Tactical. DATA is / at Ops, RIKER has the Command Chair. All other stations are staffed by n.d. crewmembers.
 DATA / We are approaching Starbase one-seven-nine.
 RIKER / Half impulse, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Going to half impulse.
 RIKER / Captain, this is the bridge. We have arrived at Starbase one-seven-nine.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged, Number One.
 RIKER / (to Wesley) Establish position -- zero-nine-zero mark three-seven-five -- at twenty-seven thousand kilometers.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 RIKER / Starbase one-seven-nine, this is the USS Enterprise.
 RIKER / Thank you.
 RIKER / (continuing) Commander Data, you have the bridge. Ensign Crusher, you will accompany me.
 DATA / Starbase one-seven-nine. We are ready to commence transfer.
 FIVE MEMBERS of the Enterprise crew (three men, two women) stand on the transporter pads. Riker and the TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN at the control panel. / Wesley is off to one side. Riker eyes them with a warmth and with a sense of humor.
 RIKER / This is my last chance to say that it has been a pleasure to serve with you and to wish you luck on your new assignment. You have served the Enterprise well. (slight smile) No tears, please.
 RIKER / (continuing) Energize.
 RIKER / Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, your first officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will step outside and Lieutenant Lewis will assign you to crew quarters. (to Mendon) Ensign, you are here on the exchange program, you'll follow Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Mordoc, what are you doing here? You couldn't have graduated from the Academy already.
 MENDON / I am not Mordoc. I am Mendon. Ensign Mendon of the planet Benzar.
 WESLEY / I'm sorry sir. I thought you were a friend... Mordoc... (beat) ... You look just like him.
 MENDON / We are from the same geostructure. Naturally we look alike.
 WESLEY / How do you tell each other apart?
 MENDON / We just do.
 RIKER / Well, nice to have you here Ensign. There will be a briefing and indoctrination session as soon as you settle in.
 MENDON / I want to tell you how happy I am to be assigned to the Enterprise. It wasn't just luck. I requested it. I know I can be of great help to the ship.
 RIKER / (surprised) Yes, of course. Now if you'll just follow Ensign Crusher.
 MENDON / Yes sir.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker, report to the Phaser Range, please...
 RIKER / On the way.
 PICARD / I was wondering if you had any feelings about the Officer Exchange Program that has been initiated by Starfleet Command.
 RIKER / Just positive ones sir. I've already welcomed Ensign Mendon on board and he certainly seems eager to please.
 PICARD / That's a Benzite trait. (beat) It's been suggested that one of the officers on the Enterprise might like to participate in this exchange program.
 RIKER / Probably a good idea.
 PICARD / There's a Klingon vessel in the vicinity.
 RIKER / I don't recall ever hearing of a Federation officer serving on a Klingon vessel.
 PICARD / Neither have I.
 RIKER / It could be beneficial.
 PICARD / Having Worf on board certainly has been.
 RIKER / Yes sir, that's true. (a shot) Who did you intend to send?
 PICARD / I was going to ask for a volunteer.
 RIKER / I wouldn't mind, sir.
 PICARD / What was that, Number One?
 RIKER / I said I wouldn't mind the assignment.
 PICARD / Any particular reason?
 RIKER / (broad grin) Because nobody has ever done it before.
 PICARD / I'll notify starbase of your acceptance... They'll contact the Klingon vessel and make the arrangements.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 42606.5. I have informed the staff of Commander Riker's temporary duty assignment and we have departed from Starbase one-seven-nine and are headed for a rendezvous with the Klingon vessel, the Pagh.
 WORF / I have studied and know everything about my heritage.
 RIKER / Then you are the one to fill me in on something that I'm not clear about. (beat) It's my understanding that one of the duties of the first officer on a Klingon ship is to assassinate the captain.
 WORF / Yes sir.
 RIKER / (reacts) Wouldn't that bring about chaos?
 WORF / Of course not. When and if the captain becomes weak and unable to perform, it is expected that his honorable retirement should be assisted by his "first." (beat) The second officer would assassinate you for the same reasons.
 RIKER / (beat) This method of attrition could take a little getting used to.
 WORF / The Klingon system has operated successfully for centuries.
 RIKER / It is different.
 WORF / Many things will be different.
 MENDON / That's a wonderful method of maintaining a constant control factor over defensive shields, but I'm sure there's a way to improve response time.
 MENDON / Oh, sorry, didn't mean to interrupt you... Just thought I could be of some help, however I am correct in what I said.
 MENDON / That is superb designing, absolutely first rate.
 WESLEY / Yes it is. Would you care to be more specific?
 MENDON / The input sampling. It's simple yet efficient enough. Of course a minor change of the helm readout would be much more helpful in emergency situations.
 WESLEY / We've never had any trouble with it. Have you seen it work?
 MENDON / Not in a practical exercise, but in theory... my theory... it would be more than a marginal improvement. I'll have to mention this to the captain.
 WESLEY / You're going to advise Captain Picard?
 MENDON / Captain Picard... I'll have to discuss these improvements with him. (beat) He is open to some astute observations, isn't he?
 WESLEY / Well, I've never heard Captain Picard refuse to listen to his officers.
 MENDON / Outstanding! Pretty soon we'll get things running perfectly.
 RIKER / A Klingon delicacy. That's heart of targ -- this is pipius claw. And this is stewed "gagh."
 RIKER / Serpent worms... would you like to know how they're prepared?
 RIKER / Not if I weaken first.
 RIKER / (sniffing an awful drink) That's something to look forward to. Would you like a drink, Doctor?
 RIKER / (mock serious) Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed.
 PICARD / I understand the theory of the feast before the transfer. I've done the same thing dozens of times. However, I usually made more civil choices.
 RIKER / These are the most civil choices.
 PICARD / I see... Well, their food may be somewhat backward but the Klingons are efficient, loyal to their beliefs, and are regulated by a strict code of ethics.
 PICARD / But they are pure in that tradition.
 PICARD / This is a great opportunity, Number One. We really know so little about them. We have so much to learn. (beat, smile) I think I envy you, Will Riker.
 RIKER / An emergency transponder?
 WORF / Slightly altered to transmit an omnidirectional signal and an emergency call.
 RIKER / (examining) Are you sensing some trouble that I don't?
 WORF / (embarrassed) Simply a security precaution. I want to insure your return to this ship.
 RIKER / (surprise) Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf?
 WORF / Efficiency, Commander.
 RIKER / (smile) I understand. Thank you, Lieutenant.
 WORF / We have a Klingon vessel approaching.
 PICARD / Hailing frequencies open.
 WORF / They are returning our hail in proper language. It is the Pagh.
 PICARD / On viewscreen.
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Enterprise.
 PICARD / We are preparing to do so. You're getting a good man, Captain Kargan.
 MENDON / Not very hospitable are they?
 WORF / That is not your concern. Observe your station, Ensign Mendon.
 MENDON / (realizing) Didn't mean to offend you.
 WORF / You didn't... (beat) ... Yet.
 PICARD / Transporter Room, prepare to beam Commander Riker aboard the Pagh.
 PICARD / Good Luck, Commander.
 RIKER / Thank you sir.
 PICARD / On your command, Will.
 RIKER / Energize.
 DATA / Viewscreen off. Resume course.
 WESLEY / Aye sir.
 PICARD / Take over Commander Data, I'll be in my quarters.
 DATA / Yes sir.
 MENDON / Sir, I'm Ensign Mendon. I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am to be aboard the Enterprise.
 PICARD / (distracted) Yes, of course. Nice to have you on board.
 MENDON / If you have a few minutes I've noted a few procedural items that could speed up operations on the bridge.
 MENDON / (continuing) I pick things up very quickly.
 PICARD / I'm sure you do Ensign, you have an excellent record. However, on the Enterprise we use the chain of command. You may report your observations to Lieutenant Worf.
 MENDON / I didn't mean to challenge your authority... (trailing off) ... I just wanted to impress upon you...
 PICARD / No need to apologize Ensign... we should have explained it better during indoctrination.
 WORF / Ensign Mendon... You may impress me.
 RIKER / Something wrong?
 RIKER / (smile) I'm just your average everyday human who happens to be a commander. Now what are your orders?
 RIKER / Proceed.
 RIKER / I am Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
 RIKER / (beat) I don't understand.
 RIKER / I have no such intentions, Captain.
 RIKER / I'm afraid I still don't understand.
 RIKER / I have been assigned here to serve this ship and to obey your orders. I will do exactly that.
 RIKER / (meets his gaze) I just did.
 RIKER / Was there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant?
 RIKER / Then I take it you challenge my authority over you.
 RIKER / (to Kargan) And your position in this, Captain?
 RIKER / My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is how to obey my orders. (beat) Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner over that of lieutenant?
 RIKER / Agreed, Captain Kargan.
 WORF / Sir, the automatic scan has registered some unknown substance on the aft quarter of the exterior skin of the dorsal fin.
 PICARD / Zero in on that location and define.
 MENDON / I've located it sir. The dorsal of the Engineering Section.
 DATA / On viewscreen. Focus on area. Magnification factor ten.
 DATA / (continuing) Increase magnification to twenty.
 PICARD / Analyze.
 DATA / The substance appears to be a rare form of subatomic "bacteria," capable of doubling every fifteen minutes. It seems to be reacting with two of the compounds present in the Enterprise structure.
 PICARD / Determine origin.
 MENDON / I noticed it when I did an intensive scan of the Pagh, the Klingon ship.
 PICARD / (reacts) And you informed no one?
 MENDON / I have not yet completed my full analysis.
 PICARD / You are supposed to report whatever is out of the ordinary. This falls into that category.
 MENDON / But sir, as I said I have not yet completed my analysis. It would be improper to report it until then.
 DATA / How did you come by that decision?
 MENDON / It is a Benzite regulation. No officer on the deck of one of our ships would report an occurrence like this until he had a full analysis and a resolution. (beat) I have simply followed proper procedures.
 PICARD / It is our procedure for you to bring to the attention of command any possibility of danger. You will not make those decisions. (beat) Is that clear, Ensign Mendon?
 MENDON / Yes sir.
 PICARD / Fine. Now I want you to complete the analysis and determine the danger not only to this ship but the Klingon vessel as well.
 MENDON / Yes Captain... That will take a couple of hours.
 PICARD / You'll remain at your station until it is complete, then report to me. Lieutenant Worf will supervise you.
 WORF / Yes sir.
 WORF / (continuing) ... and then I will instruct you in Enterprise etiquette.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Commander's log, supplemental, Stardate 42607.8. I have been on the Pagh a short time but long enough to be impressed with the abilities and singlemindedness of the Klingons. I can now see why they have gained the respect of Captain Picard.
 RIKER / Well, I'm not that hungry.
 RIKER / Fine. The "pipius" was excellent, and I also liked the "Bregit lungs."
 RIKER / Excellent.
 RIKER / This is "gagh," isn't it?
 RIKER / Yes... but this is still moving.
 RIKER / Easier?
 RIKER / Don't tell me you're still concerned about my not weakening?
 RIKER / Of course, I'm sure they all died with honor.
 RIKER / Endure what?
 RIKER / One or both?
 MENDON / It is confirmed that the organisms feed on some of the compounds that make up the Enterprise hull.
 PICARD / And the Klingon ship, the Pagh?
 MENDON / (hesitates) They are much more susceptible. Their hull contains all of the compounds.
 PICARD / Project your calculations.
 DATA / According to the rate of reproduction there should be a twelve centimeter hole in the Klingon hull at this time.
 PICARD / Signal them at once and advise them. Change our course to attempt an intercept. We will make every attempt to cleanse the vessel and assist with repairs.
 DATA / It will take some time to locate them. They are on undesignated maneuvers in the Pheben solar system.
 PICARD / Then start immediately. Alert Engineering of this situation. Ensign Crusher, adjust course toward the proper sector.
 WESLEY / Aye sir. Shall we prepare for warp speed?
 PICARD / Yes... (beat) ... and hope that we get there in time.
 RIKER / I felt no collision. Were we hit by a small meteor?
 RIKER / Corrosion then.
 RIKER / (orders) Science Station, analyze.
 RIKER / Then what is it?
 RIKER / You must have a way to repair it.
 RIKER / There has to be. Where did this come from?
 RIKER / There was no direct contact with the Enterprise.
 RIKER / It's normal procedure.
 RIKER / None! Why would they do that? We are allies.
 RIKER / I can't.
 RIKER / Wait a minute. Why? There's no new weapon. The Enterprise has no reason to do this, especially not with me on board. It makes no sense.
 RIKER / Captain, what do you intend to do?
 WESLEY / You seem to be making progress. You've already eliminated half the possibilities.
 MENDON / Thank you, but I seem to have become efficient a little later than was needed. It was my responsibility to learn and adapt to the Enterprise's regulations. I didn't do that.
 WESLEY / Not really, it was an error. Captain Picard may not like them, but he does know they can happen from time to time.
 MENDON / I failed, I had an opportunity to show the captain my superior abilities and I failed. I can never recover from that.
 WESLEY / It was a mistake... That's all. You didn't put the organism on the hull. You discovered it and you were attempting to analyze it. All you did was mess up a little on the ship's protocol.
 MENDON / I know you're trying to be nice to me and I appreciate it. What I don't understand is why?
 WESLEY / Why not? I thought you could use a friend.
 MENDON / Thank you. I only hope I can learn your ways before I "mess" up again. I imagine my methods seem foolish to you.
 WESLEY / They are different. But that's what this exchange program is all about... You learn the way we do things and bring that information back to your command. It's up to you to decide which way is better for you. (beat) It's easy. All you have to do is learn.
 MENDON / You're right. I'll try your way... (turns back to Science Station) I'll work even harder than before. I'll succeed brilliantly.
 RIKER / Yes... So?
 RIKER / I don't know. Let's ask them.
 WESLEY / Sir, bearings show that we should be in contact with the Klingon ship.
 DATA / Slow to impulse speed. Continue on course.
 WESLEY / Aye sir, impulse speed.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open. There is no response.
 PICARD / Continue to transmit.
 DATA / The Pagh is either destroyed or cloaked.
 PICARD / Begin intensive scan for debris. Conduct a thorough search of the area.
 RIKER / They may be here to help you... Don't be a fool!
 RIKER / I haven't. I am simply trying to get you to understand.
 RIKER / Yes sir, I did.
 RIKER / I can't.
 RIKER / I cannot surrender the secrets of Starfleet and the Enterprise to you.
 RIKER / (strong) I won't break any vow I took in the past. I also swore a loyalty to your ship and I will keep that.
 RIKER / No sir, they are not! I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as first officer, and in an attack against the Enterprise I will die along with this crew... but I will not dishonor my oath to the Enterprise.
 RIKER / So be it.
 MENDON / Sir, I have something to report to you immediately.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Ensign.
 MENDON / I have managed to isolate the organism on our hull.
 PICARD / Spare me the technical details... just the results.
 MENDON / They are of a sub-micron form. They are controllable and can be removed from the hulls of both ships.
 PICARD / (relieved, but covers) Thank you Ensign, well done. Prepare whatever procedures are necessary. (to Worf) Lieutenant Worf, add this information to hailing messages.
 WORF / Aye sir. Still no response.
 RIKER / They mean it... They will help.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental, Stardate 42608.2. Although our search has been extensive, we are still unable to locate the Klingon ship or any debris. The absence of both leaves us puzzled and somewhat tentative.
 DATA / Considering the absence of debris, it is reasonable to assume the Klingon vessel is in the vicinity and cloaked.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 DATA / Since we do not know their intent I recommend we go to Red Alert.
 PICARD / (thoughtful for a beat) Make it so.
 RIKER / It is normal procedure when entering into a suspicious situation. The act is not aggressive. The Enterprise will not fire first.
 RIKER / (a beat, then) You'll get only one shot.
 RIKER / Then I recommend you do not fire until you are within forty thousand kilometers.
 RIKER / It will reduce their response time.
 RIKER / Would you do less?
 RIKER / Just something I have to say... (beat) ... I dispute your judgment. Your reasons for forcing this confrontation are not valid.
 RIKER / Yes sir.
 RIKER / No sir, it is a signaling device.
 WORF / We are getting an emergency signal from a command transponder. Location nine-three-five mark six-one-three... Frequency and code designate it as Commander Riker.
 PICARD / (touches com link) Chief O'Brien, align with emergency transponder signal.
 PICARD / We may have to stretch it a little. On my command.
 WORF / Forty-eight thousand.
 DATA / Lieutenant Worf to the Transporter Room. Doctor Pulaski will accompany you. Mendon take over the count.
 MENDON / Yes sir. Forty-five thousand and still closing.
 MENDON / Forty-four thousand.
 PICARD / Transporter Room, ready. You will control defensive shields...
 MENDON / Forty thousand...
 PICARD / Transporter Room, energize.
 RIKER / Hold where you are Klag. I have relieved Captain Kargan. He was acting in an irrational manner. I am now your captain!! (beat) Serve this ship as I have!
 WORF / I am Lieutenant Worf of the Starship Enterprise.
 WORF / (with pride) Of course, he is a Klingon captain.
 RIKER / Cloaking shields off.
 RIKER / Obey my orders.
 RIKER / If we are, it will be in battle and I will die with you. (harder) Now, cloaking shields off!
 DATA / It is the Pagh sir. It has all armament locked on us and ready to fire.
 PICARD / Hold position. Hailing frequencies open. (beat) Calling the Pagh. This is the Enterprise. We are here to assist you. Do not fire.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Pagh... Do you read me??
 RIKER / Enterprise, this is Captain William Riker of the Klingon vessel, the Pagh. (pause) I order you to lower your shields and surrender.
 PICARD / Lower shields. (beat) Surrender as ordered.
 PICARD / (nods) Transporter Chief, prepare to beam Captain Kargan aboard the Pagh. (to Riker, who has heard) Captain Riker, preparations are ready for immediate repairs to your ship.
 RIKER / Thank you, Captain Picard.
 RIKER / I don't want your command.
 RIKER / And I give it back to you now.
 RIKER / No more, Captain Kargan...
 RIKER / (nods) Thank you, my friend.
 RIKER / That might be one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.
 PICARD / You're wrong, Number One... it was almost the longest. (beat) You did well.
 RIKER / Thank you. I learned quite a bit.
 PICARD / Apparently not how to duck.
 RIKER / When not to duck would be more accurate.
 PICARD / If that was the intention... Welcome aboard.
 RIKER / Thank you. Your little toy worked.
 WORF / I'm glad it did, sir.
 RIKER / You come from a very brave and unique race. I'm glad you're here on the Enterprise.
 WORF / Thank you, Commander... (beat) ... and welcome home.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 42523.7. We are in route to newly established Starbase one-seven-three for port call. Crew rotation is scheduled, and we will offload experiment modules.
 RIKER is seated shuffling cards. O'BRIEN, GEORDI and / DATA pulling out chairs. Data wears an eyeshade. Data / is almost into the chair when O'Brien stops him.
 DATA / That would seem to be rank superstition.
 RIKER / (slapping the cards down in front of O'Brien who cuts them) The game is five card stud, nothing's wild.
 DATA / This game is exceedingly simple. With only fifty-two cards, seventeen of which I will see, and four players there are a limited number of possible winning combinations.
 GEORDI / There's more to it than just the cards.
 DATA / The bets will give an indication of the relative strengths of each hand.
 GEORDI / I think I'm in trouble.
 RIKER / I'll raise five.
 DATA / I will raise you three.
 RIKER / Your three and five more.
 DATA / Is this what is known as the poker face?
 RIKER / Are you playing or not?
 DATA / I will fold.
 DATA / (continuing) You had nothing.
 GEORDI / He bluffed you, Data.
 DATA / It makes very little sense to bet when you cannot win.
 RIKER / But I did win. I was gambling that you wouldn't call.
 DATA / But how can you tell?
 PICARD / (with a little edge on the words) My God, if it isn't Phillipa Louvois, back in uniform.
 PICARD / Unbelievable, after all this time, and we're picking up the threads of old fights as if we'd never been apart.
 PICARD / What are you doing out here?
 PICARD / Anything is possible. You returned to Starfleet.
 PICARD / You didn't have to leave.
 PICARD / No. That was your own damn stubborn pride.
 PICARD / No, you went way beyond doing the job. You enjoyed it.
 PICARD / Flummery, you've always enjoyed the adversarial process more than arriving at the truth.
 PICARD / (continuing) Well, I hope you've learned a little wisdom.
 PICARD / (forcing a smile, and we see the tension leech from his body) I'm not being self-righteous. Merely right.
 PICARD / Come and sit down.
 PICARD / But he hasn't arrived yet.
 PICARD / Past experience.
 PICARD / I thought you were meeting someone?
 PICARD / Admiral, Commander Maddox, allow me to introduce my first officer, Commander William Riker.
 PICARD / How long has it been since we've seen each other?
 PICARD / (lightly) Oh yes, and I seem to remember a certain young lieutenant who had harsh words about snap inspections, and the admirals who pulled them.
 PICARD / Happy to have you, Admiral.
 PICARD / Bridge. Congratulations on your appointment. Command of a Starbase.
 RIKER / Admiral on the bridge.
 PICARD / I was a little surprised at the decision to put a base in force this close to the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf.
 DATA / My condition does not alter with the passage of time, Commander.
 PICARD / The two of you are acquainted?
 DATA / And were the sole member of the committee to oppose my entrance on the grounds that I was not a sentient being.
 PICARD / What exactly will this work entail?
 PICARD / (pausing for a beat to assimilate this) I think we will remove this discussion to the lounge.
 PICARD / Explain this procedure.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / It sounds intriguing.
 PICARD / How will you proceed?
 DATA / You have constructed a positronic brain?
 DATA / Have you determined how the electron resistance across the neural filaments is to be resolved?
 DATA / That would seem to be a necessary first step.
 DATA / But if the answer is not forthcoming, your model will not function.
 PICARD / You seem a little vague on the specifics. What are the risks to Commander Data?
 DATA / (to Picard) His basic research lacks the specifics necessary to support an experiment of this magnitude.
 PICARD / Data is a valued member of my bridge crew. Based on what I've heard I cannot allow him to submit to your experiment.
 PICARD / No, it's not. This is one of my key officers, and he's been removed without consulting me.
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / You sent for me, sir?
 PICARD / Please, sit down. We've got a problem.
 DATA / I find myself in agreement with that assessment of the situation, sir.
 PICARD / Your service to this ship has been exemplary. I don't want to lose you.
 DATA / I am pleased to hear you say so. Thank you.
 PICARD / There is a solution which presents itself.
 DATA / Yes, sir?
 PICARD / Undergo the procedure, then the transfer order becomes moot.
 DATA / I will not submit to this procedure.
 PICARD / Data, I understand your objections to this procedure, but I also have to consider Starfleet's interests. If Commander Maddox is correct there is a possibility that many more beings such as yourself could be constructed.
 DATA / True, but possibility is a word which can encompass any number of outcomes -- good and bad.
 PICARD / But if he's right, Starfleet would be immeasurably enriched.
 DATA / Captain, I am a Starfleet officer. Can they force me to do this?
 PICARD / It's precisely because you are a Starfleet officer that they can. We take an oath to serve. In this case this is the form your service is taking.
 DATA / Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes are far superior to human biological eyes, true?
 PICARD / Yes.
 DATA / Then why are not all human officers required to have their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants?
 DATA / (continuing) I see. It is precisely because I am not human.
 PICARD / That will be all, Mister Data. (jabs open the com on his desk) Computer. Pull all relevant Starfleet regulations concerning officer transfers.
 PICARD / I need your help.
 PICARD / I've been trying to make heads or tails of this gibberish, and it's finally defeated me. My android officer has been transferred so he can undergo a highly dangerous procedure. I want to stop it.
 PICARD / Once Maddox has Data under his control anything could happen. I don't trust that man.
 PICARD / (pacing) Acceptable risks, justified risks, yes, but I can't accept this. It's unfair and unjust. What about his rights...
 PICARD / (raising a warning finger) Don't start. Is there an option?
 PICARD / (stiff because he thinks she's taunting him) Yes, I came to you. You're the JAG officer in this sector. I had to come to you.
 PICARD / Trust is too painful a word.
 DATA / It is customary to request permission before entering an individual's quarters.
 DATA / Reduced to mere sterile facts of the events. The substance, the flavor of the moment could be lost. Take games of chance...
 DATA / Yes, I had read and absorbed every treatise and textbook upon the subject, and felt myself tolerably well prepared for the experience. Yet, when I finally played poker, I discovered that the reality bore little resemblance to the rules.
 DATA / That while I believe that you can download the information contained in the positronic brain, I do not think you have acquired the expertise necessary to preserve the heart of those experiences. There is an ineffable quality to memory that I do not believe can survive the shutdown of my core.
 DATA / No, sir, I am not under your nor anyone else's command. I have resigned from Starfleet.
 DATA / I regret the decision, but I must. I am the culmination of one man's dream. This is not ego or vanity, but when Doctor Soong created me he added to the substance of the universe. If by your experiments I am destroyed, something unique and wonderful will be lost. I cannot permit that, I must protect the dream.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Bruce Maddox, having been thwarted by Data's abrupt resignation from Starfleet is now seeking a legal remedy for his woes. Captain Louvois has requested my presence at those discussions.
 PICARD / Data is a valued member of my crew, an outstanding bridge officer, a --
 PICARD / He's an officer in Starfleet. He has certain rights...
 PICARD / Starfleet is not an organization that ignores its own regulations when they become inconvenient. Whether you like it or not, Data (separating and punctuating each word) does... have... rights.
 PICARD / A decision with such broad-ranging implications must be supported by an official ruling. (to Phillipa, icy) And I trust you will apply the same zeal to your research that you used during the Stargazer court-martial.
 WESLEY / You're supposed to rip the wrapping off a present.
 DATA / But with the application of a little care, Wes, the paper can be utilized again.
 WESLEY / You're missing the point.
 DATA / The Dream of the Fire, by K'Ratak. Thank you, Worf.
 WORF / It was in the hands of the Klingons that the novel attained its full stature.
 DATA / That is quite all right. None was expected...
 DATA / Thank you. I will take that under advisement. (noticing Geordi sitting alone in a corner nursing a drink) Excuse me, please. (to Geordi) Is something wrong?
 GEORDI / Of course there is. You're going away.
 DATA / No one regrets the necessity more than I, but you do understand my reasons?
 GEORDI / Oh yeah, I understand. I just don't like your being forced out. It's not fair.
 DATA / Doctor Pulaski would, at this juncture, no doubt remind us that life is rarely fair.
 GEORDI / Sorry, but that doesn't make it any easier.
 DATA / (slowly, a little awkwardly) I shall... miss you.
 GEORDI / (rising) Me too. (he gives Data a fierce hug) You take care, Data.
 RIKER / Deanna... does Data have... do you feel anything from him?
 TROI / I can't sense anything from Data. But that proves nothing. There are many minds from which I can read no meaning.
 RIKER / There's got to be more to him than software, nets and chips.
 TROI / It is possible that Commander Maddox is correct and we are anthropomorphizing Data. Assigning to him emotions and responses which he may not have.
 RIKER / I'm not sure I see that as a problem.
 RIKER / (stepping forward) Yes, to which I don't recall inviting you.
 DATA / They are currently somewhat indefinite, but my programming offers a number of alternatives. (crossing to Wesley, and dropping an arm over the boy's shoulders) I am considering teaching. I have had some success with my star pupil.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Number One, Captain Louvois has called. We're expected in her office. Meet me in Transporter Room Five.
 RIKER / (touches his insignia) On my way. (to Maddox) I know you're just leaving. I'll escort you.
 PICARD / And if I challenge this ruling?
 PICARD / Then I so challenge. Convene your hearing.
 PICARD / Surely there are regulations to cover this eventuality.
 PICARD / Very well.
 RIKER / And who gets the unenviable task of prosecuting this case?
 RIKER / I can't. I won't. Data's my friend, my comrade. We've served together and I not only respect him, I have affection for him.
 RIKER / A system that pits people against each other can't be the answer.
 RIKER / You want me to try and prove that Data's a mere machine. I can't. I don't believe it. I know he's more than that. I'm neither qualified nor willing to do this. You're going to have to find someone else.
 RIKER / (bitterly) I see I have no choice but to agree.
 PICARD / You don't have to remind us of our duty. Just remember yours.
 PICARD / (cutting straight to the heart of the matter, with no attempt to soften the blow) Captain Louvois has issued a ruling that you are the property of Starfleet Command. You can't resign.
 DATA / I see... from limitless options I am reduced to none, or rather one. I can only hope that Commander Maddox is more capable than it would appear.
 PICARD / No, you're not going to submit. We're going to fight this. Captain Louvois may be overly attached to the letter of the law, but she has not forgotten its spirit. She's convening a hearing and we are going to lay the question of your legal status to rest once and for all. (he rises, and paces away, turns back, and adds uncomfortably) I have been asked to represent you, but if there is some other officer with whom you would feel more comfortable --
 DATA / Captain, I have complete confidence in your ability to represent my interests.
 PICARD / Care to try your hand, Number One?
 RIKER / Another time. It's too close to our real contest.
 PICARD / (exchanging blows with his opponent) This isn't about you and me.
 RIKER / Isn't it? Data may be the issue, but our performances are what will be judged.
 PICARD / (exchanging several lightning blows with his opponent) That's the nature of the adversarial process.
 RIKER / Which can only work when the opponents are of equal ability.
 PICARD / (turning very slowly, leaning on his sword and regarding Riker) Are you suggesting that we are not evenly matched?
 RIKER / No, but for Data's sake it has to be said. I've been forced into this, and I have only one option. To give this my best effort.
 PICARD / I see. (slash) Then... you are here... (slash) to warn me... (slash) that you are going to do... (slash) Everything within your power and within the boundaries of the law... (slash) to win!
 RIKER / Yes.
 PICARD / So am I.
 PICARD / All right, I'm going to need to know everything about you.
 DATA / Sir, all of that information is stored in the Enterprise computer banks.
 PICARD / I want to hear it from you.
 DATA / (cocking his head like a puzzled bird) Very good, sir. Activation occurred twenty-seven years ago on Omicron Theta. I entered the Academy in '44, and graduated in '48 with honors in probability mechanics and exobiology. First posting...
 PICARD / Data, Data, Data, whoa, stop. I could get this from the computer.
 DATA / I believe I indicated that earlier, sir.
 PICARD / I need to know how you think, what you want, how you feel. What drives you, motivates you.
 DATA / Drives? Motivates? Sir, may I inquire as to the purpose of this line of questioning?
 PICARD / We have to prove that you're a sentient life-form.
 DATA / (extremely puzzled) But I am not. I am a machine.
 PICARD / That's not what I need to hear.
 DATA / How can we deny the obvious?
 PICARD / We're searching for an argument which will legally deny that obvious fact.
 DATA / But if it is a fact how can argument alter --
 PICARD / Data!
 DATA / Sir?
 PICARD / Stop babbling. (rewinding the threads of his fast-tattering patience) The law recognizes many things as people that aren't possessed of flesh and blood. It's a little legal fiction, you see.
 DATA / I am beginning to understand why Shakespeare wrote, let us kill all the lawyers.
 RIKER / Computer, identify Riker, William T. Clearance level blue.
 RIKER / Access all technical schematics of Lieutenant Commander Data.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Personal log. Zero three hundred. I should be resting. Instead I continue to prepare for a duty I do not wish to perform. Truth should not be reduced to a prize in a battle of wills and words.
 PICARD_RIKER / We are, your honor.
 RIKER / Your honor, there is only one issue in this case and one relevant piece of evidence. I call Lieutenant Commander Data.
 RIKER / Your honor, we'll stipulate to all of this.
 PICARD / (leaping to his feet) Objection, your honor, I want it read. All of it.
 RIKER / Commander Data, what are you?
 DATA / (looking to Picard for guidance, Picard nods to him to answer) An android.
 RIKER / Which is?
 DATA / Webster's Twenty-Third Century Dictionary, Fifth Edition, defines Android as an automaton made to resemble a human being.
 RIKER / (musing) An automaton. Made. Made by whom?
 DATA / Sir?
 RIKER / Who built you, Data?
 DATA / Doctor Noonien Soong.
 RIKER / And he was?
 DATA / The foremost authority in cybernetics.
 RIKER / More basic than that. What was he?
 DATA / (puzzled, but groping for the right answer; he says questioningly) A human?
 RIKER / Thank you. Data, what is the capacity of your memory, and how fast can you process information?
 DATA / I have an ultimate storage capacity of eight hundred quadrillion bits. My total linear computational speed has been rated at sixty trillion operations per second.
 RIKER / Your honor, I offer into evidence prosecution's exhibit A. A bar of plasteel with a tensile strength of forty kilo-bars.
 RIKER / (continuing) Commander Data, would you please bend that.
 PICARD / (again on his feet) Objection, your honor. Many races possess meta-human strength. It's not relevant to the issue before this court.
 RIKER / (to Phillipa) Drawing on the log record of the construction of the prototype android Lore, also constructed by Noonien Soong, I request that I be allowed to remove Commander Data's hand for your inspection.
 PICARD / Objection! What is the point of all this?
 RIKER / (sotto voce to Data) I'm sorry.
 RIKER / (continuing) Data is a physical representation of a dream, an idea conceived of by the mind of a man. His purpose? To serve human needs and interests. He is a collection of neural nets and heuristic algorithms. His responses are dictated by an elaborate software program written by a man. The hardware (slapping the hand against his palm) was built by a man.
 RIKER / (continuing) And this man has turned him off. Pinocchio is broken, the strings are cut.
 PICARD / I request a recess.
 PICARD / I've lost, and I'm not even sure I mind. Data is a machine. But there is something bothering me. Something I'm missing. Or is it just wounded pride that I've lost and in front of her.
 PICARD / (waving it aside) Ancient history.
 PICARD / (Drumming fingers on the table, abruptly he decides to tell her. It emerges in sharp staccato.) The Stargazer court-martial. It should have been a routine hearing. Yes, I had lost my ship, but my actions were entirely justified. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Phillipa was assistant to the prosecution. She dug up every obscure case and citation and the panel hammered at me for three days. It damn near ended my career. It did end us. She's enjoying this situation. She knows I disapprove of the adversarial system. Now she's forced me into active participation, and she's both pleased and angered to see me fail.
 PICARD / (pushing back his chair) Well, there's only one thing to do. I go to her in the morning, and we discuss a deal.
 PICARD / I have to salvage at least some of Data's rights. If Data agrees to undergo Commander Maddox's procedure we can get out of this hearing before he's declared the property of Starfleet command.
 PICARD / The ability to build another. A hundred others, a thousand.
 PICARD / Explore for us. Enter the dangerous situations.
 PICARD / (very intent) You said something earlier about decisions today.
 PICARD / Precedent! This case will set the precedent for all the future Datas. It will determine their status, and they'll all be property.
 PICARD / (very excited) Not a word we want back in our vocabulary.
 PICARD / (making his opening statement) Commander Riker has dramatically demonstrated to this court that Lieutenant Commander Data is a machine. Do we deny that? No. But how is this relevant? We too are machines, just machines of a different type. Commander Riker has continually reminded us that Data was built by a human. We do not deny that fact. But again how is it relevant? Does construction imply ownership? Children are created from the building blocks of their parents' DNA. Are they property? We have a chance in this hearing to severely limit the boundaries of freedom. And I think we better be pretty damn careful before we take so arrogant a step. I call Lieutenant Commander Data to the stand.
 PICARD / (continuing; lifts out the case of medals, and displays the contents) What are these, please?
 DATA / My medals.
 PICARD / Why pack them? What logical purpose do they serve?
 DATA / I... I do not know, sir. None I suppose. I just wanted them. Is that vanity?
 PICARD / (holding up the book of sonnets) And this?
 DATA / It was a gift from you, sir.
 PICARD / You value it?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Why?
 DATA / It is a reminder of friendship and service.
 PICARD / (lifts out the holocube, and triggers it; Tasha stands before them) And this? You have no portraits of any other of your crewmates. Why this person?
 DATA / I would prefer not to answer that question, sir. I gave my word.
 PICARD / Mister Data, may I remind you, that you are under oath. (more gently now) And under the circumstances, I don't think Tasha would mind.
 DATA / (swallowing convulsively several times) She was important to me... we were... intimate.
 PICARD / I have no further questions of this witness.
 RIKER / I have no questions, your honor.
 PICARD / I call to the stand Commander Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness.
 PICARD / Enough. Suffice it to say, he's an expert. (right up in his face) Commander Maddox, it is your contention that Data is not a sentient being and therefore not entitled to those rights reserved for all other life-forms in this Federation?
 PICARD / Why, Commander?
 PICARD / What is required for sentience?
 PICARD / Do you know what sentience is, Commander?
 PICARD / Excellent. Then you can enlighten the rest of us.
 PICARD / (continuing; right in Maddox's face) Prove to this court that I'm sentient.
 PICARD / Why? Because you can't do it?
 PICARD / So I'm sentient, but Data isn't?
 PICARD / Why?
 PICARD / Ah, the second ingredient. But let's deal with the first requirement. Is Data intelligent?
 PICARD / Why?
 PICARD / Like this hearing. What about self awareness. What does that mean? Why am I self aware?
 PICARD / Data, what are you doing now?
 DATA / I am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights and status. Am I property or person?
 PICARD / And what's at stake?
 DATA / My right to choose. Perhaps my very life.
 PICARD / My rights. My status. My right to choose. My life. He seems pretty damn self aware to me. Well, Commander Maddox, I'm waiting.
 PICARD / Do you like Data?
 PICARD / But you admire him?
 PICARD / (interrupting) Piece of engineering and programming. Yes, you've said that. You've devoted your life to the study of cybernetics in general?
 PICARD / And Data in particular?
 PICARD / And now you're proposing to dismantle him.
 PICARD / How many more?
 PICARD / And do what with them?
 PICARD / How?
 PICARD / (interrupting; he picks up an object and throws it down a disposal chute) Are expendable.
 PICARD / Are you expendable, Commander Maddox? Never mind. A single Data is a curiosity, a wonder, but a thousand Datas, doesn't that become a new race? And aren't we going to be judged as a species about how we treat these creations? If they're expendable, disposable, aren't we? What is Data?
 PICARD / What... is... he?
 PICARD / Is he? Are you sure?
 PICARD / But he's met two of your three criteria for sentience, and we haven't addressed the third. So we might find him meeting your third criterion, and then what is he?
 PICARD / He doesn't know. (to Phillipa) Do you? That's the decision you're facing. Your honor, a courtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away the egos, the selfish desires, the half-truths, until we're left with the pure product -- a truth -- for all time. Sooner or later it's going to happen. This man or others like him are going to succeed in replicating Data. And then we have to decide -- what are they? And how will we treat these creations of our genius? The decision you reach here today stretches far beyond this android and this courtroom. It will reveal the kind of a people we are. And what (points to Data) ... they are going to be. Do you condemn then to slavery? Starfleet was founded to seek out new life. (indicating Data) Well, there he sits, your honor, waiting on our decision. You have a chance to make law. Well, let's make a good one. Let us be wise.
 DATA / Continue your work, Commander, and when you are ready I will still be here.
 DATA / Yes, it would be a less lonely universe if there were more of my kind.
 DATA / Sir, there is a celebration on the Holodeck.
 RIKER / I have no right to be there.
 DATA / (edging closer) Because you failed in your task?
 RIKER / (slewing around in his chair at that) No, God, no. Data, I came this close to winning.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / (in agony just remembering) I could have cost you your life!
 DATA / (moving in, and seating himself opposite Riker) Yes, that is true, but Commander... Will, I have learned from your experience.
 RIKER / What could you have possibly learned from this kind of ordeal?
 DATA / That at times one must deny their nature, sacrifice their own personal beliefs to protect another. Is it not true that had you refused to prosecute, Captain Louvois would have ruled summarily against me?
 RIKER / Yes.
 DATA / That action injured you, and saved me. I will not forget.
 RIKER / (taking his hand) You're a wise man, my friend.
 DATA / Not yet sir, but with your help I am learning.
 DATA is at Ops and WORF at Tactical. RIKER stands / behind ENSIGN GIBSON at Conn. PICARD sits at his Command Station.
 RIKER / Captain, we are approaching Klavdia Three.
 PICARD / Take us to impulse power.
 GEORDI is at his position. WESLEY CRUSHER is nearby. / 
 GEORDI / Bridge, this is Engineering.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, Lieutenant.
 GEORDI / Now that we are out of warp, I would like to use this time to make routine adjustments to the deuterium control conduit. It's overdue.
 RIKER / (to Picard) That would preclude use of our warp drive engines.
 PICARD / How much time do these adjustments require?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / A few hours, sir.
 RIKER / You may proceed, Lieutenant La Forge. Standard orbit.
 GEORDI / I am going to need an S-C-M, model three, from stores.
 WESLEY / Right away.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 PICARD / Not a very inviting planet. Even for a research outpost.
 TROI / I would have thought the inhabitants of Daled Four would send a future leader to a more hospitable environment.
 WORF / For some, security is more important than comfort.
 TROI / But sixteen years...
 WORF / We are being hailed, Captain.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 PICARD / This is Captain Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 DATA / The planet's troposphere is distorting the signal.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Can you clean it up?
 WORF / I'll try.
 PICARD / This is Picard -- would you please repeat your message?
 PICARD / That is correct.
 PICARD / Human.
 RIKER / Friendly, isn't she?
 PICARD / Whether they're friendly or not, Salia has the rank of head of state. We will treat both her and Anya accordingly. Number One, Mister Worf, let's greet our visitors.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN stands at the controls. / Picard and Riker focus on Salia, who glances around the room, enthusiastically taking in her new environment.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / It is.
 PICARD / Of course.
 RIKER / If you like, I'll arrange a tour of the ship.
 PICARD / Very well.
 PICARD / We are housing you in the quarters normally reserved for Starfleet admiralty. I'm sure you'll find them quite comfortable.
 WESLEY / Yes... It's a... say, how did you know that?
 WESLEY / Who are you? No one mentioned we were beaming up such a... a...
 WESLEY / I don't believe this! Who is she?
 RIKER / (teasing) I think she's a governess.
 WESLEY / (impatient) Not her. The girl.
 RIKER / I doubt she'll have time for you, my friend. She's slated to rule an entire world.
 WESLEY / Come in.
 DATA / You wanted to see me.
 WESLEY / Data -- the girl who just came on board.
 DATA / Salia of Daled Four.
 WESLEY / There's almost nothing in the computer about her.
 DATA / Very little is known.
 WESLEY / What can you tell me?
 DATA / She was born on Daled Four. Her parents were from opposite sides of factions which have been feuding for centuries. They died shortly after her birth. A Federation ship brought her and her governess to Klavdia Three to be raised in a neutral environment.
 WESLEY / And now she's returning.
 DATA / It is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Wesley, are you all right?
 WESLEY / (surprised) Geordi. (then remembering the magnet) Oh... Yes.. I'm fine... I just...
 GEORDI / We are waiting for the part.
 WESLEY / I'm on my way.
 WESLEY / Got to go. Thanks, Data.
 RIKER / Captain, we've laid in a course for Daled Four. We will remain on impulse power until Lieutenant La Forge completes his adjustments.
 PICARD / Status report on our passengers, Lieutenant Worf. Did the accommodations meet with their approval?
 WORF / I doubt anything ever meets with that woman's approval, sir.
 TROI / Captain, I'm concerned.
 PICARD / About... ?
 TROI / Our new passengers. Their emotions do not seem to fit... (puzzled) ... well, who they are and what they're doing.
 PICARD / (alert) Are you suggesting they're not who they say they are?
 TROI / Actually... no. It's more like they're not exactly what they seem to be. At least, not exactly.
 PICARD / Captain Picard to Salia's quarters. May I turn on the viewer?
 PICARD / Are your quarters satisfactory?
 PICARD / Feel free to contact me if you need anything. Picard out.
 TROI / What I sensed in that seems entirely normal. Emotionally, I judge her to be very drawn to our young ensign.
 DATA / What puzzles me, Captain, is how she is expected to bring peace to Daled Four. The one thing we do know about it is that its inhabitants have been fighting throughout their recorded history.
 PICARD / What do we know about the cause of their wars?
 DATA / Only that it is the difference between night and day.
 RIKER / Data, you just used a colloquialism.
 DATA / I did? I meant that Daled Four does not rotate. One side has constant night, the other constant daylight. One might surmise that the two hemispheres developed disparate cultures, which is a major cause of most wars.
 PICARD / And yet somehow this child is supposed to bring them together.
 RIKER / She looks too delicate for a task like that.
 WORF / Do not be fooled by her looks. The body is just a shell.
 GEORDI / Energy depletion level.
 GEORDI / Wesley?
 GEORDI (O.S.) / (louder) Wesley! Haven't you found the defocused area yet?
 WESLEY / I'm looking!
 GEORDI / I see the way you're looking.
 WESLEY / Sorry.
 WESLEY / (continuing) I've got my mind on something.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Geordi, this girl they beamed up, she's... she's perfect! Perfect!
 GEORDI / Now I understand why you can't concentrate.
 WESLEY / I'll do better.
 GEORDI / What is it?
 WESLEY / (apologetic) I had it on the wrong setting.
 GEORDI / (beat) I suppose it had to happen to you. It usually does at about this age.
 WESLEY / What usually does?
 GEORDI / Glands suddenly meshing together. It happens to all of us.
 WESLEY / You've got to be joking. Just because I said she's interesting...
 GEORDI / You said she's "perfect." (waves) Go. You're no use here for now. Go talk to her. Take the lift.
 WESLEY / That's silly, Geordi. (hesitates) Well, since you recommend it... If she'll talk to me, how should I approach her? What would I say?
 GEORDI / Just say "Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher. I'd like to talk to you."
 WESLEY / And then what?
 GEORDI / Whatever occurs to you.
 WESLEY / What if nothing occurs to me?
 GEORDI / Wesley, I don't really have time for this. You're going to have to ask somebody else.
 WESLEY / Okay.
 WORF / That is how the Klingon lures a mate.
 WESLEY / Are you telling me to go yell at Salia?
 WORF / No. Men do not roar. Women roar. Then they hurl heavy objects. And claw at you.
 WESLEY / What does the man do?
 WORF / He reads love poetry. He ducks a lot.
 WESLEY / Yes, well, that might work for Klingons, but I think I should try something less dangerous.
 WORF / Then go to her door. Beg like a human.
 DATA / It should be that simple, Wesley. Judging by her appearance it is likely you and Salia are biologically compatible. Of course, there may be a difference in the histocompatibility complex in the cell membrane.
 WESLEY / Data! I want to meet her, not dissect her.
 PICARD / Captain Picard to Salia's quarters.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / May I activate the viewer?
 PICARD / (on viewscreen) I've arranged for Anya to have a tour of the ship. Maybe you'd like to go along.
 PICARD / (on viewscreen) Your escort will be there shortly. Picard out.
 WORF / I am here to escort you on a tour of the Enterprise.
 WESLEY / But what do I say? How should I act? What do I do?
 RIKER / Guinan, I need your help. Could you sit over there?
 RIKER / (to Wesley) The first words out of your mouth are the most important. You could start by saying something like... (turns to Guinan) ... "you're the most beautiful woman in the galaxy."
 RIKER / (continuing) But that might not work.
 RIKER / If you only knew how much I wanted to tell you that.
 RIKER / Yes.
 RIKER / Of us. Of what we could become...
 WESLEY / Commander Riker...
 RIKER / ... and that you might have thought it was a line.
 RIKER / Then you think I'm not sincere?
 RIKER / Then you're inviting me in?
 RIKER / That's more than I expected.
 RIKER / To hope is to recognize the possibility. I had only dreams.
 RIKER / Not these dreams.
 RIKER / (continuing) I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars... And all the universe worships night.
 RIKER / Then I'll learn to fly. You are the heart in my day and the soul of my night.
 WESLEY / I don't think this is my style.
 GEORDI / This is the Deuterium Control Conduit. I'm probing it to find a defocused area.
 GEORDI / There's nothing to be concerned about. I'm just making routine adjustments.
 WESLEY / Nothing.
 WESLEY / Actually all you have to do is tell the computer what you want and it will prepare it for you.
 WESLEY / I don't know. what do you like?
 WESLEY / I know... Computer, Thalian chocolate mousse.
 WESLEY / On Thalos Seven they age the cocoa beans four hundred years.
 WESLEY / It's one of my favorite places.
 WESLEY / It's the best part of being on the Enterprise.
 WESLEY / There's too many!
 WESLEY / It's time we changed that.
 WESLEY / Come with me.
 PICARD / (to guards) Hold your fire.
 PICARD / Anya!
 PICARD / (to Anya) The situation is under control.
 PICARD / It will have to be.
 PICARD / Nevertheless, you will obey my orders. You are to remain in your quarters and in your present form for the remainder of this voyage. Is that clear?
 PICARD / Keep her under guard.
 WORF / What kind of creature is she?
 PICARD / I've never seen anything like her.
 WORF / Such a species would make a perfect "protector."
 PICARD / I want a security team stationed outside Sickbay, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Aye, sir. Captain... if Anya transforms?
 PICARD / Stop her.
 WORF / (to Guards) Remain here. (to Anya) You are restricted to these quarters for the remainder of this voyage.
 WESLEY / Oh, yes. And there are so many more -- all special - -all so different. And all the different kinds of life-forms.
 WESLEY / Then, think of what you have to look forward to. This is the best time to be alive.
 WESLEY / For us both. Everything is just beginning. We've only charted nineteen percent of our galaxy... the rest is out there -- waiting for us. And already, look at what we've discovered.
 WESLEY / Wait. Computer -- Rosseau Five.
 WESLEY / Oh, yes.
 WESLEY / And one day you'll visit Rosseau Five... and other places and more spectacular than this.
 WESLEY / Now, listen. In a moment the orbits of the moons will become synchronous.
 WESLEY / I never thought of it that way.
 WESLEY / Soon you'll see it for yourself.
 WESLEY / How about something to drink?
 PICARD / We have obviously brought a very dangerous life-form aboard this ship. I want to minimize the chances of another incident.
 TROI / Captain, whatever kind of life-form Anya may be, emotionally she is really Salia's mother.
 PICARD / And the most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young.
 TROI / Exactly.
 PICARD / Yes?
 WESLEY / Believe me, the Ten-Forward room is not an illusion.
 WESLEY / Is something wrong?
 WESLEY / That makes you sad?
 WESLEY / Is that what awaits you on Daled Four?
 WESLEY / But I thought you were going there to unite two groups which have been fighting.
 WESLEY / Very little. There is almost nothing in the ship's computer about Daled Four. What will you do there?
 WESLEY / You could stay.
 WESLEY / Why not?
 WESLEY / (as they walk) What is it? What happened?
 WESLEY / (continuing) Salia!
 WESLEY / I don't understand.
 WESLEY / Salia, nothing is impossible!
 WESLEY / There's a way. I know there is!
 PICARD / (stern, a hint of tension) Wesley, step away from her.
 GEORDI / Energy depletion level.
 GEORDI / La Forge to bridge.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes, Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / I have just completed the final adjustments. Thank you for giving me the time. You now have warp engines available.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Very good.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Get us there as quickly as possible, Number One.
 RIKER / Ensign Gibson, warp eight point eight.
 RIKER / Estimated time to Daled Four?
 PICARD / Ensign Crusher, when you have completed your duties in Engineering... report to my Ready Room.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / The woman Anya is not what she appears to be. She is an allasomorph.
 WESLEY / A shape shifter?
 PICARD / Yes. She is not just the governess, she is also the girl's protector. I don't like to interfere in personal relationships of anyone under my command, but...
 WESLEY / You want me to stay away from Salia.
 PICARD / Yes, I do. For the good of the ship and the safety of everyone on board.
 WESLEY / I will do as you ask.
 PICARD / Standard orbit.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Hailing frequencies open.
 DATA / Sir, it is unlikely that Daled Four will respond.
 PICARD / Explain.
 DATA / The troposphere appears to be absorbing our signals. It is fascinating, Captain. Klavdia Three and Daled Four have almost identical atmospheres.
 PICARD / Magnify. Times twenty.
 PICARD / The physical resemblance to Klavdia Three is striking.
 RIKER / Remarkable... How could anyone live in an environment so totally hostile to human life?
 DATA / Apparently Klavdia Three was chosen for Salia because these conditions are important for their species's survival.
 PICARD / Possible, Mister Data.
 RIKER / Or else... they just wanted her to feel at home.
 WESLEY / Come in.
 WESLEY / Salia! (pause) You shouldn't have come.
 WESLEY / I didn't say that.
 WESLEY / Does Anya know you're here?
 WESLEY / (pause) I'm glad you came. I thought Anya would have kept you with her.
 WESLEY / In other words, you slipped away.
 WESLEY / I'm not in trouble... yet.
 WESLEY / With my wild way of life?
 WESLEY / (touches his communicator) Security to crew quarters!
 WORF / You are not supposed to be here.
 WORF / Escort them both to their quarters. And secure it with a forcefield.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Since Anya's powers of transformation apparently gave her the ability to escape her guards unnoticed, we have sealed her quarters with a forcefield that will contain her no matter how small a form she may take.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Meanwhile we remain unable to communicate with Daled Four.
 WORF / Captain -- I'm receiving an audio signal.
 PICARD / Audio on.
 DATA / Sir, sensors indicate the communication originated from a gigawatt source on the planet.
 RIKER / That's more power than our entire ship can generate.
 DATA / It is what is needed to penetrate the atmosphere.
 RIKER / Which means we lack the ability to respond...
 WORF / Captain, there are beam-down coordinates encoded within the carrier signal.
 PICARD / Splendid.
 RIKER / I'll arrange for our guests to beam down.
 WORF / We have arrived.
 WESLEY / Was it fun?
 WESLEY / Playing humanoid. Was it fun?
 WESLEY / But what are you really?
 WESLEY / Yes.
 WESLEY / I loved you.
 WESLEY / Can you?
 RIKER / Prepare to beam Salia to the specified coordinates.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / I hope some day Daled Four and the Federation will have formal contact.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF / Coordinates set, sir.
 RIKER / (to Transporter Chief) Proceed.
 WESLEY / Wait!
 WESLEY / A taste to remember me by.
 WESLEY / You already have.
 WESLEY / Why?
 WESLEY / We have had enough disguises between us. It's time for the truth.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Energize.
 WESLEY / Seeing her on the transporter pad was like seeing pure light. (he pauses) I miss her. I feel so empty.
 WESLEY / I'm never going to feel this way about anyone else.
 WESLEY / I didn't expect you to say that.
 WESLEY / Knowing that doesn't make it any easier.
 WESLEY / I better get back to my duties.
 RIKER / We have the course set for Aldebaran Zeta, Sir.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, set speed -- warp six point five.
 WESLEY / Done, Captain.
 PICARD / Engage.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 42609.1. In response to a desperate plea for aid by my old friend, Captain Donald Varley of the USS Yamato, I am running a grave risk and taking the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD at his desk, scanning a screen of data, / schematics of the Galaxy Class starships, as:
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) This rendezvous is necessitated by dangerous malfunctions which are plaguing our sister ship. Perhaps with both crews working together we will be able to eliminate the problem -- before we are detected by the Romulans.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher -- how long to rendezvous?
 WESLEY, WORF, and TROI are at their stations. RIKER / is at Science One with DATA. Picard crosses to his seat.
 WESLEY / Four minutes, thirty-three seconds, sir.
 PICARD / Status of download, Mister Data?
 DATA / Entire Yamato log will be in our computer by rendezvous.
 RIKER / (to Data) Have you nailed down our little hiccup yet?
 DATA / Sir?
 RIKER / The odd reading.
 DATA / No. It might be due to the problems currently being experienced by the Yamato.
 PICARD / Trouble, Number One?
 RIKER / I'm not sure, sir. (to Worf) We are alone out here?
 WORF / Yes, sir. There are no other vessels in the area except the Yamato. (checks his panel) Which is coming into viewer range now.
 WORF / Transmission from the Yamato, Captain -- on visual.
 PICARD / Donald, what's a nice Starfleet Captain like you doing in a place like this?
 RIKER / And no idea what's causing these problems?
 PICARD / Are you suggesting it's a design flaw?
 RIKER / (urgently) Do you wish to evacuate non-essential personnel to the Enterprise?
 PICARD / Donald, we'll get our teams to work. I'm sure neither of us feels too comfortable sitting around the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / In the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Don, this was quite a risk to run just to satisfy an archaeological curiosity.
 PICARD / Don, your transmission is breaking up. (rising, then to Data) Clean that up.
 WORF / (tensely) Sir, there is an energy build-up in the Yamato's engineering section.
 PICARD / Yamato, this is the Enterprise, come in Yamato.
 WORF / Magnetic seals in the antimatter chamber decaying!
 PICARD / Captain. Don!
 PICARD / (continuing) Shields up!
 WORF / Sir!
 DATA / (quietly) Sensors indicate no life readings from the Yamato's saucer section.
 WORF / (looks up from his instruments) Captain! Another vessel coming into sensor range. (ominously) It is Romulan.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The Yamato's entire crew and their families, more than a thousand people, have been lost.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Circumstances, unfortunately, permit us no pause for grief.
 WORF / No response from the Romulan vessel.
 RIKER / Arm phasers and prepare to lock on target.
 PICARD / (to Data) Did they attack the Yamato?
 DATA / Unknown, sir.
 WORF / All their weapons systems have been fully activated. Still no response.
 PICARD / (upward glance; then, sternly) Romulan vessel, this is Captain Picard of the USS Enterprise. Explain your illegal presence in the Neutral Zone --
 PICARD / Are you responsible for the destruction of the Yamato?
 PICARD / (looking to his bridge crew) Comments?
 TROI / She is extremely anxious --
 WORF / Understandable if she just destroyed a Federation starship.
 RIKER / Your scan was inconclusive. We can't be sure of what happened to the Yamato.
 TROI / Our presence in the Neutral Zone is provocative. It could force her to respond.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Open com. We will comply when we have determined the cause of the Yamato's destruction. And when we are fully satisfied that you were not responsible. Picard out.
 WORF / They are engaging their cloaking device.
 RIKER / Good. They can't fire when they're cloaked.
 WORF / Unless they have overcome that deficiency. The Yamato was destroyed while they were cloaked.
 PICARD / Forget the Romulans. I want to know what happened to the Yamato. Number One, assemble the staff for a conference in one hour. And I want answers.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / (pointing) Sensor recordings reveal that what we witnessed was an uncontrolled and catastrophic matter_antimatter mix. The magnetic seals between the chambers collapsed --
 PICARD / That's not possible.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir, it is, but a highly improbable series of events has to take place before such an occurrence can result.
 PICARD / Explain.
 GEORDI / In the event of a breach of seal integrity there is an emergency release system which dumps the antimatter.
 DATA / Apparently such a dump began, was then halted, and the containment seals were dropped. There was still sufficient antimatter present to lead to the result we observed.
 PICARD / Then there is no evidence that a weapon was used?
 TROI / I'm sorry I'm late. I was with the children. They have been deeply affected by the Yamato's destruction.
 PICARD / Mister Data.
 DATA / Evidence of a weapon? No, sir, none.
 GEORDI / However it happened, the Yamato did it to herself.
 PICARD / Theorize. What do you think caused this catastrophic malfunction?
 GEORDI / (looking very grim) I think Captain Varley may have been correct. There could be a design flaw.
 RIKER / In a Galaxy Class starship?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. It's the most complicated piece of machinery ever built. Something could have been overlooked.
 PICARD / Knowing where the flaw is located, do you think you can isolate and solve the problem?
 GEORDI / We're working on it now.
 PICARD / Pull any and all personnel who might be useful to your task.
 TROI / (to Picard) If we have established that the Romulans were not responsible for the destruction of the Yamato, would it not be prudent for us to withdraw?
 PICARD / If this is a design flaw, we better stay where we are and give Geordi time to work. Or what happened to the Yamato could happen to us.
 PICARD / Computer, access Captain Donald Varley's personal log. Search parameter, locate entries containing the words Romulan and Iconia.
 PICARD / Mister Data, there is a reference in Captain Varley's personal log to a probe which scanned the Yamato.
 DATA / Yes, sir. We have a visual record.
 PICARD / Put it on Main Viewer.
 RIKER / What the devil is that?
 PICARD / (to Data) Have you ever seen anything like that before?
 DATA / No, sir, but it appears to be a scanner. Possibly a transmitter.
 RIKER / Transmitting what?
 DATA / Unknown, sir.
 PICARD / Engineering.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge.
 PICARD / Progress on your matter_antimatter scan?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Everything continues to check out. I'm starting an analysis of the magnetic coils.
 PICARD / Data, when the Yamato was probed, where was she?
 DATA / In orbit around a planet at coordinates two two seven mark three five nine.
 PICARD / Estimated time of arrival at warp factor eight?
 DATA / Twelve hours, sixteen minutes.
 WORF / Sir, that would put us substantially closer to the Romulan side of the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / It can't be helped. Ensign Crusher, lay in a course. Warp factor eight.
 PICARD / (continuing) We are going to assume the Yamato's mission.
 RIKER / And risk a war?
 PICARD / If that's what it takes to get some answers.
 PICARD / Come.
 WESLEY / Sir, may I talk to you for a minute?
 PICARD / Yes.
 WESLEY / It's about the Iconians, sir. I'd always heard that they were just a myth.
 PICARD / China was thought to be only a myth until Marco Polo travelled there. No, the Iconians were real. We know that three systems in this sector have a number of cultural similarities. Similarities which can be explained only if there had been a single unifying force.
 WESLEY / The Iconians colonized those worlds?
 PICARD / Probably conquered.
 WESLEY / So they were warlike?
 PICARD / Perhaps. Ancient texts refer to them as the Demons of Air and Darkness, but that could have so many different interpretations.
 WESLEY / Air and darkness?
 PICARD / Legend has it that they travelled without the benefit of spaceships. Merely appearing from thin air on distant planets.
 WESLEY / That sounds like magic.
 PICARD / Wouldn't we seem magical to a stone-age people?
 WESLEY / (responding to Picard's enthusiasm and echoing it) How did you find out about all this?
 PICARD / Archaeology has been a hobby since my Academy days. But why don't we talk about what really brought you here?
 WESLEY / I can't stop thinking about the Yamato. All those people -- dead. I just don't know how you do it. You, Commander Riker, Geordi, you all handle it so easily.
 PICARD / Easily. No, not easily.
 PICARD / (continuing) Darjeeling tea, hot. We handle it because we are trained to, as you will be. But if the time ever comes when the death of even a single individual fails to move us --
 PICARD / (continuing) That should not have happened.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. As happened with her sister, the Enterprise is being plagued by a series of system failures.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) So far they are random, but perhaps early symptoms of what happened to the Yamato.
 GEORDI / La Forge!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant, are you making any progress toward a solution to our problems?
 GEORDI / A solution, no sir, but I can eliminate one worry. It is not a design flaw. I've been reviewing the Yamato's log, and I think maybe that alien probe had something to do with her problems.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / How?
 GEORDI / I'd need to see the thing.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / If it was the probe, that explains the Yamato; but how do you account for the difficulties the Enterprise is experiencing?
 GEORDI / I can't.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Are our problems likely to attain the seriousness experienced by the Yamato?
 GEORDI / If you want speculation, yes sir, I think they are. I need time.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant, time is the one thing which we do not have in abundance.
 DATA / Scanning.
 PICARD / (impatiently) Mister Data.
 DATA / No life-form readings.
 WORF / All major cities have been heavily damaged, and the pattern of destruction is consistent with large-scale orbital bombardment.
 PICARD / How long ago?
 DATA / Approximately two hundred thousand years.
 WORF / There is an energy source in the mountains of the smaller continent.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / Is this Iconia?
 PICARD / Donald Varley died believing that it was.
 WORF / Captain! Projectile launched from the planet's surface!
 DATA / (checking readings) Its size and composition match the probe which scanned the Yamato.
 PICARD / Shields up. Ready the tractor beam. Lieutenant La Forge, I'm about to assist you in your research. A probe has been launched from Iconia. I intend to capture it.
 GEORDI / No, sir, wait!
 GEORDI / (continuing) Captain! Captain! (no response) Damn!
 GEORDI / Bridge!
 GEORDI / (continuing; shouts) Emergency stop!
 GEORDI / Emergency stop! Stop dammit!
 WORF / Tractor beam ready, sir.
 PICARD / Prepare to lower shields, Mister Crusher.
 RIKER / Geordi, are you --
 GEORDI / Destroy it, sir, quickly!
 PICARD / Worf, target phasers!
 WORF / Phasers locked on target.
 PICARD / Fire!
 PICARD / (continuing; cool as ice) Mister La Forge, are you all right?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir, and thank you for trusting me. If that thing had managed to scan us, we would have had no hope of saving the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / That probe was a transmitter sending an alien computer program. The same program that is currently aboard the Enterprise and trying to rewrite our software in its own image. We have two completely incompatible computer systems trying to interact.
 RIKER / So that's why the ship's instruments have become so erratic.
 GEORDI / Yes.
 PICARD / What can you do?
 GEORDI / Not very much. The Iconian program is so sophisticated I don't think I'll ever understand it.
 DATA / Consider, Captain, this program has entered an alien data base -- ours -- and in less than seven hours it has managed to not only learn our system, but has also begun to reprogram our computer.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) So the earlier probe was responsible for the Yamato's destruction.
 GEORDI / Only insofar as the probe transmitted the program.
 RIKER / But we weren't scanned by the probe. So how did this thing get aboard the Enterprise?
 DATA / We downloaded the Yamato log, and contained in the log was the program.
 PICARD / So why haven't we suffered their fate?
 GEORDI / The program affected all systems on the Yamato simultaneously. But with us, the program was deposited in a specific section of our mainframe. It's having to work its way out from that location. That gives us a little breathing space.
 RIKER / Not much. Reports of injuries are mounting.
 DATA / Doctor Pulaski is unwilling to trust the turbolifts. She is sending medical teams through the access tunnels.
 GEORDI / Sir, the Enterprise computer system is a lot like our bodies with a voluntary and involuntary system. Probably ninety percent of what happens on this ship is done automatically, completely beyond our control. We're sitting on a bomb that could go any second -- or never.
 RIKER / Can you stop this thing?
 GEORDI / I'll give it my best shot.
 GEORDI / Dammit!
 DATA / Try a bypass on the shield control interface.
 GEORDI / No go. Let me see if I can directly access the master program.
 GEORDI / (continuing) What happened?
 DATA / Any answer would be mere speculation. This is just another example of how our actions have random results.
 GEORDI / Thank you, Data, I noticed.
 RIKER / Life support has failed on Decks Seven and Thirteen.
 RIKER / (continuing) Suppose this thing manages to rewrite our entire system? It's so far beyond us that we don't have a hope of understanding it, much less controlling it. Our ignorance could kill us.
 PICARD / We may never reach that point. A variation of what happened to the Yamato may destroy us first.
 RIKER / So we just sit here while the ship disintegrates around us?
 PICARD / The probe was launched from Iconia, probably by an automated system. There may be records near the launch site which could help us find a solution.
 RIKER / I'll form an away team.
 PICARD / I will lead it.
 RIKER / You will lead it?
 PICARD / Yes.
 RIKER / We've had this discussion a hundred times before.
 PICARD / Will, ever since I was a cadet I've studied the Iconians. I have to be the one to go.
 PICARD / (continuing) The Enterprise is yours.
 RIKER / For as long as she lasts.
 PICARD / We're aware of the risks. Energize.
 RIKER / Stay sharp, Mister O'Brien, I want to be able to pull them out at a moment's notice.
 WESLEY / Commander, Romulan vessel!
 RIKER / Open hailing frequencies.
 RIKER / Shields up! Go to Red Alert!
 WESLEY / Shields not responding.
 RIKER / Ensign Crusher, we need those shields!
 WESLEY / I'm trying, sir!
 RIKER / What happened?
 RIKER / Fate protects fools, little children and ships called Enterprise. (to Williams) Lock phasers on the Romulan, but hold your fire.
 WESLEY / Sir, the shields are up.
 RIKER / (almost to himself) Impeccable timing.
 WESLEY / Uh, shields are back down.
 WESLEY / The shields are back up.
 TROI / In another time and another place this could be funny.
 RIKER / Status of the torpedo banks?
 RIKER / In case it should become necessary to fight, do you suppose you could find me some rocks to throw at them?
 RIKER / Maybe their attempt to fire was not intentional. (to Williams) Open hailing frequencies.
 RIKER / Romulan vessel, this is Commander William Riker, first officer of the USS Enterprise. Why did you attempt to fire on us?
 RIKER / Why are you still here?
 RIKER / This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything.
 RIKER / What the hell?
 RIKER / (interrupting) Having a little trouble with your systems, Commander? Maybe we could consider postponing the war until we solve our more immediate problem?
 WESLEY / Sir, another probe launched from the planet, heading for the Romulan.
 RIKER / (to Williams) Have we got our phasers back?
 RIKER / Taris, if you've got phaser capability, you better use it now!
 RIKER / Destroy that probe!
 RIKER / (continuing) And not even a thank you.
 TROI / Sub-Commander Taris is deeply frustrated, probably because her ship is as crippled as the Enterprise.
 WESLEY / Why would the Romulans be having problems? They haven't been probed.
 RIKER / They must have tapped into the Yamato log. Taris got a whole lot more than she bargained for.
 TROI / So the captain is safe for the moment.
 RIKER / Safe from the Romulans. (rises) Maintain Red Alert, and try to keep those shields up just in case Taris feels she has to act on her threat.
 WESLEY / (slewing around in his chair) Sir, what about the away team? With our shields up we can't beam them back.
 WORF / (touching his insignia) Enterprise. Come in Enterprise. Still no response, sir.
 PICARD / Keep trying them. Communication is going to be erratic.
 WORF / I do not want to become a permanent resident of this planet.
 PICARD / Nor do I, Mister Worf.
 DATA / Scans indicate no other life-forms on the planet.
 PICARD / I would not expect any. Judging from the severity of bombardment, I doubt any Iconians survived.
 PICARD / (continuing) Well, Mister Data, let us see if we can make sense of this.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / This is very reminiscent of Dinasian.
 DATA / Yes, sir. There are also similarities to Dewan and Iccobar.
 PICARD / Is it possible that they are all branches of a language family beginning with Iconian?
 DATA / Yes.
 PICARD / Run a comparison between simple, basic words in Dinasian, Dewan and Iccobar. Let's see if we can't reconstruct a common root language.
 DATA / Accessing.
 RIKER / You're jumpy.
 TROI / The tension on the ship is very high.
 RIKER / What's your recommendation?
 TROI / Give everyone something else to think about, some place to focus their attention.
 RIKER / All right, let's consider evacuation.
 TROI / (surprised) To the planet?
 RIKER / It's risky with Taris sitting out there -- it's probably impossible to pull off, but it will give everyone something to do. You go and start organizing it.
 TROI / But you will need me if you have to negotiate with Taris again.
 RIKER / I'll manage. Right now they're more important.
 DATA / Captain, your original hypothesis was correct. Iconian is the parent tongue for a language family consisting of Dewan, Iccobar and Dinasian. I have constructed a basic working understanding through a comparison of common root words such as mother, father, food, death, child, home, tribe, pain, love, mine, yours, ours --
 PICARD / Data, Data, Data -- the point.
 DATA / You do understand that my interpretation of the symbols will not be exact?
 PICARD / Yes, let's get on with it.
 DATA / (pointing to a set of symbols) This would appear to be the manual override.
 DATA / That was not manual override.
 PICARD / (to himself) Demons of Air and Darkness, indeed.
 WORF / What is that?
 PICARD / A gateway.
 WORF / The scenes could be holographic images.
 PICARD / Data, that was very foolish.
 DATA / But we have established it is not a holograph. If I step through and investigate, we would determine whether it is truly a gateway.
 PICARD / No, Data. You might not be able to get back, and I can't risk losing you.
 WORF / If it's not illusion, this gate would seem to take you beyond the confines of this planet.
 PICARD / Is this how the Iconians travelled? Stepping across light years as easily as we would cross a room? Those worlds might be in distant sectors of our galaxy.
 PICARD / (continuing; almost to himself) This is what Varley feared. What he lost his life for.
 WORF / Sir?
 PICARD / The Romulans could turn this technology into a weapon.
 WORF / Like the Iconians did.
 DATA / No, I believe that to be incorrect. Captain, there is nothing in this room to indicate it was used as a military command center. It is much more akin to a transporter room.
 WORF / But the probe was hostile.
 PICARD / We can't make that assumption. The probe's effect on the Yamato was devastating, but I suspect that was by accident rather than design.
 WORF / We do know that the Iconians were conquerors.
 PICARD / Do we? The little we know was passed down by the descendants of the people who attacked this world. I'm beginning to think the Iconians may have been the victims of some very bad press.
 DATA / Sir?
 PICARD / There's an unfortunate tendency in most cultures to fear what they don't understand. It is possible that their enemies, when confronted with this technology, were driven to attack the Iconians out of fear.
 WORF / Sir!
 WORF / Was that really the Enterprise?
 PICARD / I believe that it was. Gentlemen, we have a way home. (a beat) I think the Iconians might have outfoxed their enemies. Perhaps they didn't all die in the bombardment; some may have passed through this.
 DATA / Sir, there is a vast underground power source which is controlled by this console.
 DATA / (continuing) My triggering of the gateway has caused a dramatic upsurge in power levels. (runs more scans) Ah, I have access.
 WORF / Sir, the Enterprise again.
 PICARD / Time the rotation.
 PICARD / Data, respond.
 DATA / Captain.
 WORF / Are you all right?
 DATA / No, I am damaged.
 PICARD / How bad is it?
 DATA / The Iconian program is attempting a rewrite of my basic software. Physical manifestations --
 WORF / Sir, without him we have no hope of deciphering the program.
 PICARD / How long until the Enterprise reappears?
 WORF / Six minutes if the cycle holds.
 PICARD / Stand ready, Mister Worf, and go through with Data. Geordi can learn from him. Maybe help him.
 WORF / Sir, we have not yet established that that... (a gesture to the gate) ... is truly a gateway.
 PICARD / This will be the test.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (holding out a hand) Data, give me your tricorder.
 DATA / Sir, what is your present location?
 PICARD / I'm right in front of you... Data, what is it?
 DATA / Please, take the tricorder. I am unable to sufficiently pinpoint your location to be able to hand it to you.
 PICARD / You're blind.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (handing the tricorder to Worf) Destroy this.
 WORF / But, sir, it contains the record of all that we have discovered here.
 PICARD / And that is precisely why it must be destroyed. Time?
 WORF / Three minutes.
 PICARD / (to himself) I am running out of time. We all are.
 PICARD / (continuing) This room and the technology contained in it must be destroyed. It cannot be allowed to fall into Romulan hands.
 DATA / I understand...
 PICARD / How! How do I do it? How can I destroy everything? Control room, the probes? All of it.
 DATA / The... power... source.
 PICARD / I detonate it?
 DATA / Yes.
 PICARD / (giving Data a shake) How? What do I do?
 DATA / The... probes.
 PICARD / Probes... the probes. Launch? Do I launch the probes?
 PICARD / (continuing; to Worf) What's that going to do? Nothing.
 DATA / Doors.
 PICARD / Doors?
 WORF / Perhaps the probes are in a launch bay.
 PICARD / The doors will open automatically when the launch begins. I'd have to override.
 DATA / Yes.
 PICARD / The power source! The backwash from the rockets will spill into the main power grids and cause an overload.
 DATA / Cor... rect.
 PICARD / Which control keys? Damn, I forgot you can't see.
 DATA / Help.
 DATA / (continuing) Describe.
 PICARD / We're directly opposite the gateway. There is a rectangular screen.
 DATA / (shakes his head) Left... one meter.
 PICARD / Triangular screen. The lights directly above are solid amber. To the left red --
 DATA / Cor... rect. Key... blue, amber... amber... red.
 PICARD / That's the launch sequence?
 PICARD / (continuing) How do I override the doors?
 DATA / Blue, blue, blue.
 PICARD / I hope you're not stuttering. (to Worf) I don't know how long a delay there will be between the launch and the detonation. I'll hold off keying the launch sequence until you're through the gate. How long until the Enterprise returns?
 WORF / Almost time, sir. Captain, you will be killed.
 PICARD / I'll go through the gate.
 WORF / But where will you end up?
 PICARD / Any place is going to be better than this room. Worf, I'm depending on you. Get Data back to the Enterprise. He may be their last hope.
 RIKER / Worf! What happened? Where's the captain?
 WORF / We must take Data to Engineering.
 GEORDI / I don't know how to help him. But comparing recorded norms for Data to the current readings, it's clear that all his functions are going crazy. If we had an expert -- Maddox, or somebody --
 GEORDI / (continuing) He's gone.
 GEORDI / Data!
 RIKER / What the hell?
 DATA / Ah, I have access.
 GEORDI / The self-correcting mechanism --
 DATA / (looking for Picard) Captain? Captain?
 GEORDI / It's constantly kicking in to make minute adjustments in the positronic brain.
 DATA / This is the Enterprise. How did I get here?
 RIKER / He cleared the Iconian program from his own system. How?
 DATA / Iconia? I was on Iconia. Now I am on the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Geordi, this is critical. How?
 GEORDI / Let me think for a second. There was an incompatible program running through Data's system, so the mechanism started searching for a way to keep him alive. The solution must have been a shutdown and a total wipe of all affected memory.
 DATA / Query. What have I forgotten?
 RIKER / One question. Can we do the same thing with the Enterprise?
 GEORDI / I don't see why not... but it will have to be a complete shutdown. We turn her off, effect a wipe of the Yamato log and every subsequent event since we downloaded it. I'll then reload all the ship's programs from the protected archives in the main core.
 RIKER / Geordi, a shutdown means that the shields are going to be coming down too, and we're hanging nose to nose with a Romulan battle cruiser.
 GEORDI / Hey, Commander, whether it's Romulan phasers or our own warp engines we're just as dead.
 RIKER / Make it so.
 DATA / Can I help?
 RIKER / Lock on the captain and bring him back.
 RIKER / Damn it!
 RIKER / How the hell... never mind. Energize!
 PICARD / Did what?
 PICARD / (feeling the effects of the transporter kicking in) Not I think, today, Commander.
 PICARD / Bridge.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Get us out of here. The Romulan ship is set for auto-destruct and they can't deactivate it.
 RIKER / Wait, sir. (to O'Brien) Open a hailing frequency.
 RIKER / Commander Taris, prepare to receive a transmission from our chief engineer. He'll instruct you on how to purge your system.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Commander, your transmission has been received and acknowledged.
 RIKER / Now, Mister Data, warp speed please -- just in case Taris's engineer is not as efficient as Lieutenant La Forge.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir. (a beat) Captain, sensors picking up a large explosion on the surface of Iconia. It is equivalent to a force twelve hydrogen explosion. Blast radius is nine hundred kilometers.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (continuing) The dust particles entering the stratosphere will take an estimated seven months to fall back to the surface. The diminution in sunlight will have the effect of lowering average daily surface temperatures on Iconia by fifteen degrees Celsius.
 PICARD / I see Data's back to normal.
 RIKER / With a little touch of amnesia.
 PICARD / It seems that everything is back to normal. Well done, Commander.
 RIKER / (with a grin) Thank you, sir.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Ship's log, stardate 42625.4, First Officer Riker reporting. We have achieved orbit around Theta Eight...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) ... the planet furthest from its sun in this previously unmapped solar system. It is a world of ruthless realities: particularly harsh, barren, and inhospitable...
 RIKER (V.O.) / (continuing) Our reason for being here -- a passing Klingon cruiser reported discovering pieces of a strange vessel in the upper atmosphere. We've come to investigate...
 GEORDI / (studying the screen) Nasty. Nitrogen... methane... liquid neon. Surface temperature minus two hundred and ninety-one degrees Fahrenheit. Winds up to three hundred and twelve meters per second.
 RIKER / Not exactly a vacation planet, eh?
 GEORDI / Uh uh. Not unless you like ammonia tornadoes. Or orange lightning bolts for that matter.
 RIKER / (smiling) Not my cup of tea. Found anything artificial in the atmosphere?
 GEORDI / Nothing so far. We're just coming around to the night side now.
 RIKER / Keep me informed. The sooner we identify what the Klingons think they saw, the sooner we can get the hell out of here.
 GEORDI / Sounds good to me.
 GEORDI / (to himself) Nasty.
 PICARD sits on a chair staring at a tabletop viewer. / It has a number of equations and theorems on it -- like a present-day blackboard. The door CHIMES.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / (continuing) Fermat's last theorem. Familiar with it?
 RIKER / No. I'm afraid I spent too many math classes daydreaming about being on a starship.
 PICARD / It's intriguing. When Fermat died they found scrawled in the margin of his notes that he had found a "remarkable proof." (beat) Unfortunately he never lived to write it down. And for the last eight hundred years people have been trying to rediscover it.
 RIKER / And that includes you?
 PICARD / I find the process relaxing.
 RIKER / (changing the subject) We've detected debris of some sort in a loose orbit.
 PICARD / Can you identify?
 RIKER / I suggest we beam a section aboard for analysis.
 PICARD / Make it so, Number One.
 PICARD / Energize.
 RIKER / We've locked onto something with markings on it.
 PICARD / What sort of markings?
 RIKER / Uncertain, sir.
 PICARD / There's something here.
 PICARD / (continuing; frowning) That symbol... Do you recognize it?
 RIKER / (quietly stunned) Yes sir. I -- I think I do.
 DATA / Metallic analysis bears out that the object in question was terrestrial in origin. Most likely late twenty-first century.
 PICARD / But that's not possible. No ship of that time period could have come this far.
 DATA / Nevertheless, that is what our tests indicate. And the markings we discovered are consistent with this hypothesis.
 TROI / Any idea what destroyed it? An explosion of some sort?
 DATA / Unknown.
 PICARD / The question is, how did it get here?
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Captain. We've detected a large structure on the planet.
 DATA / It is a building of some sort, situated on a plane of frozen methane, smack in the middle of a tremendous storm belt. It is incongruous; it simply should not be there!
 PICARD / Are you certain it's artificially constructed?
 DATA / Absolutely. The structure is surrounded by breathable air.
 RIKER / It's hard to accept...
 PICARD / Yet it does seem to be down there. Is there a connection between the structure and the ship?
 PICARD / (continuing) Suggestions?
 RIKER / (small smile) Only one, sir. Suggest we go down and have a look.
 PICARD / Form an away team, minimal complement.
 PICARD / Let's see if we can find the architects.
 RIKER / We're ready when you are... (then to Worf) Phasers on stun.
 RIKER / (continuing) Energize.
 RIKER / (tense) Where are we?
 DATA / Exactly where Geordi said we would be. The structure is directly behind us.
 DATA / (continuing) I am detecting vast ammonia storms raging mere kilometers away. Yet they do not appear to penetrate this breathable zone.
 RIKER / (soft, awed) It's like the eye of a hurricane.
 DATA / It is here. It must be here, yet we cannot see it.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Enterprise, this is Commander Riker. We have arrived in a very unusual place... it is like being in the eye of a hurricane. It is completely calm, no sound, no movement, yet a few meters away a storm, which we can neither see nor hear, is raging.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Describe the structure.
 RIKER / We can't see it.
 WORF / Commander, over here. I see something!
 WORF / (continuing) What is this thing?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / What is it, Commander?
 RIKER / (to Picard, amazed) I think it's a door. An antique.
 DATA / Judging by its location, it may be an entrance to the structure we seek.
 RIKER / Well... this is what we came here for. (to Picard) Captain, we are entering the structure.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. We have entered the structure. (then, realizing) We're not getting through.
 PICARD / Where's that interference originating?
 GEORDI / From the source, sir. Cause... unknown.
 PICARD / Lock onto the landing party. Have the Transporter Room prepare to beam them up.
 GEORDI / We can't distinguish them as long as they're inside that structure.
 PICARD / Can they hear us?
 GEORDI / We've got to recalibrate all frequencies.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / Without radio contact, we should leave immediately.
 RIKER / Agreed. We'll make a preliminary sweep of this environment and then return.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice trip?
 RIKER / Uh... Do you know us?
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / We've been expecting you. A trio of foreign gentlemen.
 RIKER / We're from the United Federation of Planets --
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Of course. Welcome to The Hotel Royale...
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / No -- and for your own good you had better quit thinking about Rita.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Then you're a fool. Everybody with any sense is afraid of Mikey D.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / (confidentially to Riker) The kid's just askin' for trouble -- Rita's too much for him to handle, and Mikey D will plant his face in the pavement. (then, handing them to Riker) Now, here are your room keys and some complimentary casino chips. Enjoy!
 WORF / What is this place? How did a being like you get here?
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Why this is the Royale, of course. And my personal life is really none of your business, thank you.
 RIKER / What he means is, what planet is this?
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / I beg your pardon?
 RIKER / This planet. What do you call it?
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / (rolling his eyes) Earth. (very dry) What do you call it?
 WORF / We call it Theta Eight.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / How charming.
 DATA / Commander...
 RIKER / Yes Data?
 DATA / (reading from his tricorder) None of these people... are emitting life signs.
 WORF / You mean they're not alive?
 RIKER / (more to himself) Then what are they?...
 WORF / (to Data) These beings... are they machines, (eyes narrow) or mere illusions, designed to deceive us?
 DATA / (studying tricorder) Not illusions, Lieutenant. They do exist, but they do not register as either man or machine.
 DATA / (continuing) For example, this creature exhibits no DNA structure.
 DATA / What sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to?
 PICARD / Status report?
 WESLEY / We're attempting to employ alternate encoding schemes.
 GEORDI / There are hundreds of possible combinations, Captain.
 PICARD / Is there an intelligence causing the interference?
 GEORDI / Impossible to tell, Captain.
 DATA / Yes. I have certainly never visited this place, or its true counterpart, before.
 DATA / (to Texas, frowning) It seems he expects something of me.
 DATA / Ah, is this poker?
 DATA / Also known as twenty-one, a number which defines the object of the game. Tens and picture cards are worth ten, ace -- one or eleven -- the other cards face value. The dealer must hit seventeen -- five cards under pays double.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Having fun, Data?
 DATA / Fun, sir? While there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved I was mainly conducting research into --
 RIKER / -- Save it, Data. We're getting out of here.
 DATA / Understood, sir.
 RIKER / Our apologies. Come on, Data.
 RIKER / Try it again.
 DATA / Sir, there is no other exit point. Unless we can find another way... it seems we are trapped here.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Theta Eight, still out of contact with the away team.
 WORF / Phasers are totally ineffective on all surfaces.
 DATA / (to Riker, showing his own variety of concern now) I am checking options... they seem quite limited --
 RIKER / We don't have any. If we're ever going to get out of here, we'll have to do it on our own. (then, heading off) I'm going to get some answers out of that desk clerk...
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Are you crazy?
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / You think you're gonna scare Mikey D with that thing?
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Kid, she's a big girl... and she's Mikey D's girl.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Look. I like you. I don't want to see you get hurt... especially over some dame --
 RIKER / I want some answers!
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / The concierge can help you with any --
 RIKER / We want out of here. Now.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / I'm afraid you've missed your check-out time. We do have our rules, you know.
 RIKER / I mean out of the building. We want to get outside --
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / The Royale's exits are clearly marked.
 RIKER / That's not good enough.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / If you have a complaint about the service you've received during your stay, you can always take it up with the manager.
 RIKER / Fine! I'd like to see him immediately!
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / (calm smile) I'm afraid the manager is very busy.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (heavy static) ... Riker, can you read me?
 RIKER / Yes, go ahead.
 RIKER / (continuing) Enterprise?... Enterprise?...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (through static) ... Enterprise...
 PICARD / (into com) Why haven't you left the building, Number One?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (through static) ... Tried... Trapped here... No immediate danger...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Something at your location is interfering with our exchange... Working on the problem...
 WESLEY / These frequencies aren't working.
 PICARD / (sharply) Then find another.
 WESLEY / Yes sir.
 PICARD / (to himself) What is going on down there?
 DATA / (studying tricorder) Commander... I am picking up something most unusual in another section of this structure. Indications of DNA.
 RIKER / Where?
 DATA / Thirty-one point nine meters above and to the right of us.
 WORF / (indicates elevators) Perhaps those turbolifts could take us there.
 DATA / The reading I got is behind this door.
 DATA / My reading is intensifying.
 RIKER / Life signs?
 DATA / None.
 DATA / Definitely human. Male.
 RIKER / Looks like the poor devil died in its sleep.
 WORF / What a terrible way to go.
 DATA / He has been dead for two hundred eighty-three years. The lack of any advanced decomposition is attributable to the sterile environment.
 WORF / Commander, look here.
 WORF / Is that... this "Las Vegas" you spoke about?
 RIKER / I believe that's what the illusion is meant to be.
 RIKER / (moving, looking around the room) Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's all just... window dressing for a dead man.
 DATA / Is this significant, sir?
 RIKER / American. Fifty-two stars -- that would date it between 2053 and 2079 A.D.
 RIKER / (continuing; reading name) Colonel S. Richey.
 RIKER / (continuing; soft) Rest in peace, Colonel.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Riker.
 RIKER / Finally. (touches communicator) Riker. Go ahead.
 PICARD / What's your situation?
 RIKER / We are locked in a structure made to resemble twentieth century Earth -- all efforts to exit have failed.
 PICARD / We can't transport.
 RIKER / I assumed as much. Captain, we have located the remains of a human.
 RIKER / Request identity scan on a Colonel Richey, American, first initial S., roughly same time period.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We also need a computer library check on hotel known as the Royale; possible location, Las Vegas, Nevada, circa twenty-first century.
 PICARD / Get on it.
 WESLEY / Information retrieved, Captain --
 PICARD / Colonel Stephen Richey was the commanding officer of the explorer ship Charybdis which had a terrestrial launch date of 7-23-2067. It was the first manned attempt to travel beyond the confines of the Euclidian solar system. Its telemetry system failed and it was never heard from again... (then, intrigued) Why is this of interest, Number One?
 GEORDI / The frequency scramble remains unpredictable, sir...
 WORF / Commander? Some curiosities...
 RIKER / (taking them from Worf) Books... A novel... (reading the cover) "The Royale Hotel"... (hands it to Data) Summarize.
 DATA / The story of a group of compulsive gamblers caught up in the web of crime, corruption and deceit spun by nefarious lothario Mikey D who appears only at the climax to be brought to his knees by a heartbroken bellboy. There is a subplot about an older man conspiring with a younger woman to murder her husband while squandering her inheritance. The writing is elementary, the plotting predictable, the characters one-dimensional. The only thing of interest, quite honestly, is the intriguing setting, that of a Las Vegas gambling casino-hotel --
 RIKER / (interrupting) This novel... and everyone in it you've just described... that's this hotel...
 RIKER / (continuing) This... this appears to be a diary... but with only one entry... (reading from it with great interest now) "I write this in the hope that it will someday be read by human eyes... I can only surmise at this point, but apparently our exploratory shuttle was contaminated by an alien life-form which infected and killed all personnel except myself. I awakened to find myself here in The Royale Hotel... and for the last thirty-eight years I have survived here. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / "I have come to understand that this place was created for me out of some sense of guilt, presuming that the novel we had on board was in fact a guide to our preferred lifestyle and social habits. Obviously, they thought this was the world from which I came. I hold no malice toward my benefactors... they could not possibly know the hell they have put me through, for it was such a badly written book, filled with endless cliche and shallow characters. I shall welcome death when it comes... "
 RIKER / Then that is why... all of this is here. But why can't we get out?
 PICARD / Suppose we phaser a slice in the field which surrounds the structure?
 GEORDI / Yes...
 PICARD / How long would they live under those conditions?
 PICARD / But you could revive them.
 PICARD / I understand the risk, but I will not warp off and leave them. (to Geordi) Make your preparations.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 WORF / (into phone) Yes? (listens, frowns, turns to others) There is a female voice asking if we want... "room service."
 DATA / I believe they are asking if we want the room cleaned.
 RIKER / Tell them no.
 WORF / (into phone) No.
 RIKER / What'd she say?
 WORF / She said... "The kitchen's open twenty-four hours if we change our minds."
 RIKER / I'm going to explore the other floors; you two go down to the lobby, see if we've missed anything. Talk to the other "guests" -- try and find out who and what they are.
 DATA / I suggest we separate and blend in with these beings. Casual queries offered in an inconspicuous manner might prove most fruitful.
 WORF / What?
 DATA / Mingle, Worf. Mingle.
 DATA / If I might inquire, where are you from, sir?
 DATA / How did you get here?
 DATA / And where is your automobile now?
 DATA / Could you take me there?
 DATA / I do not believe you could go to your car, even if it truly exists. You are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am.
 DATA / The odds favor standing pat.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Boys -- we can't afford to have any trouble here -- take it outside.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Watch yourself.
 RIKER / It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere.
 RIKER / (re Mikey D) How can he leave?
 DATA / It is on page 244.
 RIKER / The book... Then... how does it end?
 DATA / A bad love affair ends in a bloody shoot-out, the hotel gets bought out and life goes on... such as it is --
 RIKER / The hotel gets bought? By whom?
 DATA / (re the book) It is not very specific. The acquiring party is simply referred to as "foreign investors." Sale price, twelve point five million.
 RIKER / That's how we're getting out. We're buying this place.
 PICARD / (sighs with frustration) Number One... If we don't take some action, make some attempt -- however dangerous it may be -- to rescue you, you may very well be lost to the confines of that conundrum for all eternity. That is certain death for you all... and that... (building angrily now) ... that is unacceptable! We have set phaser focus with energy ratios sufficient to penetrate the structure --
 RIKER / Hold on that. There may be another way. I'll keep you informed.
 DATA / It is a question of decimal percentages. Quite simple, really if one bets with any sequential consistency.
 RIKER / Can you do it?
 DATA / Certainly.
 RIKER / Go to work.
 DATA / These cubes are improperly balanced. I believe that their final resting position is adversely affected --
 RIKER / Loaded dice. (then, to Data) Can you... "repair" them?
 DATA / I believe so...
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / (to croupier) Who has the dice?
 WORF / (to Riker) Isn't that enough?
 RIKER / Almost. I don't want to be short, that's for sure... (then, to Data) You are keeping count?
 DATA / Eleven point three million. (then, whimsically) Perhaps I will bet it all --
 RIKER / No! Simply reach twelve million.
 DATA / As you wish...
 ASSISTANT MANAGER (O.S.) / The man has the touch.
 RIKER / Now.
 DATA / (to the Croupier) I would like to cash out, please.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / I'm afraid you've broken the bank. That's over twelve million --
 RIKER / Twelve point five million to be exact. The purchase price of this hotel.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / That's impossible --
 RIKER / Wrong. We're the "foreign Investors" on page 244. We're buying you out, lock, stock, and barrel. (slides the chips toward the pit boss) Consider it a "done deal."
 RIKER / Enjoy the game, friend. And don't let 'em change the dice on you.
 ASSISTANT MANAGER / Wait! You can't leave!
 RIKER / Oh yeah? Watch us. (then, wagging a finger at him) Don't forget, we own the joint.
 WORF / You're confident about this, Commander?
 RIKER / Focus. Concentrate. See only where we want to BE, not where we are.
 DATA / Ancient philosophical overtones of thought process... "Zen", I believe --
 RIKER / We own the place... and we're walking through that door...
 envelops them once again. Riker smiles confidently as he intones: RIKER / I think it's time to go home...
 smiles in relief as he hears those words. He turns to his crew. PICARD / Transporter Room, we have a fix on our away team. Beam them up... and please be quick about it!
 RIKER has cleared a space on his desk and set up a / little work station. He has a bowl and several strange-looking eggs. Some smaller containers with other ingredients and condiments for what appears to be an omelet. He breaks the last egg into the bowl and whips them with a jerry-rigged whisk. He is obviously enjoying himself. The CHIME SOUNDS.
 RIKER / Come in.
 RIKER / (continuing) Excellent. Exactly what I need.
 RIKER / (continuing) Well, Doctor, and bearing gifts?
 DATA / This is not an efficient method for the preparation of sustenance.
 RIKER / You're right, Data. The ship's computer is much more efficient, but it lacks the subtlety needed for great cooking. It mixes the ingredients to precise measurements. There's no flair, no individuality, and Data, as we both know... inspiration and flair are the difference between artistry and mere competence.
 RIKER / I have my father to thank for that.
 RIKER / No, he hated it. It was a chore left to me.
 WORF / It is my understanding that in most human families, the woman shares in the cooking.
 RIKER / There were only the two of us. I never knew my mother. She died when I was very young.
 GEORDI / Where did you get the eggs?
 RIKER / During our last stop.
 GEORDI / (with surprise) At Starbase seventy-three?
 RIKER / Yes.
 GEORDI / What kind of eggs did you say these are?
 RIKER / 'Owon.
 RIKER / (continuing) A cook's only as good as his ingredients.
 WORF / Delicious.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker...
 RIKER / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Would you join me on the bridge?
 RIKER / On my way.
 PICARD / We have picked up an automated signal from a Federation shuttlecraft.
 RIKER / A shuttle? Out here?! How is that possible? We're the first manned Federation vessel to enter this area.
 PICARD / Apparently not.
 RIKER / So what's a shuttle doing out this far? And where's the mother ship?
 PICARD / I don't know.
 WORF / Sensors indicate there is at least one life-form on board the shuttle. Humanoid.
 PICARD / Perhaps someone to answer your questions, Number One. Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Captain, the shuttle is without power. Communication is not possible.
 RIKER / Set course to intercept.
 DATA / Estimate intercept in three minutes.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 42679.2. While traversing an unexplored section of the galaxy en route to the Endicor system, a Federation shuttlecraft has quite suddenly appeared -- virtually out of nowhere. There are no other ships in the vicinity -- and no indications whence it came nor how it got out here.
 WORF / We are closing on shuttlecraft.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / Magnify.
 RIKER / (continuing) Prepare to lock tractor beam.
 DATA / Target vehicle -- we will be within tractor beam range in two zero seconds.
 RIKER / Set automatic locking device. Alert Shuttle Bay Two.
 DATA / Locking tractor beam.
 DATA / The tractor beam has been locked.
 PICARD / Number One.
 RIKER / Worf -- you're with me.
 PICARD / Doctor Pulaski, you are needed in Shuttle Bay Two.
 RIKER / Well, it's a Federation shuttle all right.
 WORF / Yet, there are no Federation vessels or bases in this area.
 RIKER / (reading) NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS Enterprise, shuttle number five.
 RIKER / (reading) NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS Enterprise shuttle number five.
 WORF / How is this possible?
 RIKER / (he touches his communicator) Captain?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / What is it, Number One?
 RIKER / Captain, are you on the bridge?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (irritated) Where else would I be?
 RIKER / Right now, I think you had better be in Shuttle Bay Two.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Why? What is it?
 RIKER / This you had better see for yourself and, Captain, bring Commander Data.
 RIKER / We have been in a lot of bizarre situations, but nothing like this.
 PICARD / What's his condition?
 PICARD / Has he been injured?
 PICARD / Then why is he unconscious? What happened to him?
 PICARD / Strange? In what way? Non-human? Artificial?
 PICARD / Can you revive him?
 PICARD / Counselor.
 TROI / I have never felt anything quite like this so it is difficult to put into words. (she pauses to gather her thoughts) That person is you. What I mean, the person we are looking at is as much Jean-Luc Picard as the person I am standing next to; beyond that there's very little of which I am sure. I will have to wait until he is conscious before knowing more.
 PICARD / Data, we have to know what is on the shuttle's logs.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Both primary and reserve power has been drained from the shuttle. I am going to have to connect to the Enterprise in order to activate the shuttle's systems.
 RIKER / Lieutenant La Forge -- report to Shuttle Bay Two.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I'm on my way.
 PICARD / Number One, I'll be in Sickbay. Keep me informed.
 RIKER / (indicating an unusual burn on the skin of the shuttle) Did you see this, Captain?
 PICARD / It looks like the kind of damage caused by an antimatter explosion.
 RIKER / Yes, the shuttle must have been just out of range.
 PICARD / (urgent) Data, I need those logs. (to Troi) Counselor.
 RIKER / We'll be on the bridge.
 RIKER / Resume course and speed. (to Worf) Scanners at maximum range.
 WORF / Maximum range.
 GEORDI / You should have power now.
 GEORDI / What happened?
 DATA / The polarity was not compatible.
 GEORDI / Not possible, the connection is idiot proof.
 DATA / The power requirements of the shuttle do not match the Enterprise. We are going to need a variable phase inverter, to align the power from the Enterprise to the circuits of the shuttle.
 GEORDI / Data, what do you think is going on? I don't just mean about the shuttle, I mean about all of this?
 DATA / I do not have enough information.
 GEORDI / The captain here, the captain there. This shuttle -- that shuttle. Commander Riker is right -- this is very strange.
 PICARD / This smells like a set-up.
 TROI / A trap?
 PICARD / (nods, yes) If it is me, me from where? And why in a shuttle? There is nothing about this which is random or happenstance. Look beneath the boards, Counselor; I expect something foul and familiar to crawl out.
 PICARD / Have you been able to determine why he is still unconscious?
 PICARD / Wake him.
 PICARD / (continuing) What happened?
 GEORDI / There... that should give you something. Making this power adjustment is very tricky. By all rights, this connection should overload all the shuttle's circuits.
 DATA / Perhaps you had better step back out of the way.
 GEORDI / Remember you're not indestructible yourself.
 DATA / Increase the power.
 DATA / (continuing) Adjust the invert two percent positive.
 GEORDI / That's the correct decision, but it's having the opposite effect.
 DATA / Yes.
 GEORDI / There is nothing I can think of which could cause such a radical change in this circuit.
 DATA / Adjust the invert two percent negative.
 GEORDI / Got it. It shouldn't work, but it does.
 GEORDI / (continuing; stunned) Data, take a look at the stardate.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Four-two-six-seven-nine-point-five. (he touches his communicator) Captain.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, we have been able to activate the shuttle; the on-board clock indicates that the shuttle is six hours ahead of us.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / (continuing) Captain, did you read me? If the shuttle is from six hours into the future, so is the other Captain Picard.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Part of the mystery has been solved. The reason there are two NCC one-seven-zero-one-D-five shuttlecrafts is because one of them is from the future... six hours to be exact. And, so presumably is the facsimile of me.
 PICARD / Try to wake him, again.
 PICARD / No!
 PICARD / I know what it is... don't sedate him. Let him be! (then, changing his tone) Please... allow him to remain conscious.
 PICARD / I'm fine, Doctor... Save your ministrations for the patient. I want a staff meeting in five minutes. Doctor, I assume you will want to remain here.
 PICARD / Keep me informed, Doctor -- of any change no matter how small.
 GEORDI / Captain, we have retrieved all we are going to get from the shuttle logs, including the last visual records. Everything before this is just a jumble.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 GEORDI / The distortion is because we had to use a phase inverter to retrieve the logs. It will improve slightly.
 DATA / According to the shuttle log, the Enterprise was destroyed three hours, nineteen minutes from now.
 GEORDI / Captain, we have a portion of your last log entry.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 GEORDI / It's audio only.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's personal log, supplemental. (there is a long pause) For the record... I have just witnessed the total destruction of the USS Enterprise with a loss of all hands, save one. Me.
 DATA / That last sound apparently occurred when the shuttle was thrown back in time.
 GEORDI / All attempts to obtain additional information from the shuttle's logs have failed.
 RIKER / At least now we have something to go on.
 GEORDI / I can't understand how you could end up in a shuttlecraft while the Enterprise is being destroyed.
 WORF / Nor I, the last thing you would do is leave the bridge of the Enterprise during an emergency.
 PICARD / Yes, but let's proceed on the premise that what we have just seen is factual and that somehow, in less than four hours, the Enterprise will be destroyed and somehow -- although this is unfathomable -- I, and I alone escaped. Discussion.
 RIKER / Our destination is the Endicor system. We are not due to arrive for three days. The charts indicate nothing of consequence, certainly nothing which could threaten the Enterprise, between here and there.
 WORF / Sensors indicated no other vessels -- Federation or otherwise -- in this area.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / I have nothing to offer. There is not enough information upon which I can base a hypothesis.
 GEORDI / Well, the shuttle apparently came from somewhere up ahead. Rather than continuing on this course, perhaps we should stop here and let whatever is out there come and find us.
 RIKER / I think it's already too late for that.
 GEORDI / Are you saying that stopping, turning left, or right, or even reversing course, is pointless?
 RIKER / When we brought the shuttle and the other Picard on board, we committed ourselves to a sequence of events which may be unalterable.
 PICARD / Yes, this isn't a rock in the road which once seen can be avoided. It's much more complex.
 WORF / There is the theory of the moebius, a twist in the fabric of space where time becomes a loop from which there is no escape.
 GEORDI / So, when we reach that moment -- whatever happened will happen again... The Enterprise will be destroyed, the "other Picard" sent back to meet with us and do it all over again. (he shudders) That sounds like someone's definition of hell.
 RIKER / I know this much -- we can't avoid the future.
 PICARD / Agreed. So let's continue on course. Everyone return to your duty stations. Somewhere out there something will happen... a decision will be made which will cause me to become separated from the Enterprise -- at the time that decision will seem correct, but it won't be. We have to anticipate and not make the same mistake once. Something is waiting for us out there -- let's determine what it is as quickly as possible.
 GEORDI / (he studies the shuttle) Data -- I think the molecular structure of the shuttle has changed!
 DATA / Your assessment is accurate.
 GEORDI / Why now?
 DATA / Perhaps it always was unstable and it was only by leaving and coming back that you were able to see the change.
 PICARD / Doctor?
 PICARD / You're saying, when our time intersects with the time he left, at that instant he will be functioning normally. And there will be two of us.
 PICARD / I don't believe that is possible.
 TROI / Captain, I am able to feel more from him now. Much of his emotions are still a jumble, but...
 PICARD / What did you feel?
 TROI / Only that he wants desperately to leave this ship.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We continue on course to Endicor. We are now less than two hours away from our rendezvous with ourselves.
 RIKER / Worf.
 WORF / All sensors are on maximum scan. There is nothing unusual to report.
 RIKER / If the timetable is correct, we should get an indication of something very soon.
 PICARD / Yes, Doctor.
 PICARD / I'll be right there.
 PICARD / (continuing) Number One, you have the bridge.
 PICARD / How is he?
 PICARD / He is now aware of me.
 PICARD / (sotto, almost to himself) But, does he know where he is, and who's here with him?
 PICARD / (then to P2) What went wrong?
 PICARD / (continuing) You know... don't you?
 PICARD / (continuing) What did you do? What happened? Why did you leave the ship?
 PICARD / (continuing) Don't turn away. Look at me.
 PICARD / (continuing) Picard!
 PICARD / (continuing) LOOK AT ME!
 TROI / He doesn't understand you.
 PICARD / He knows I'm here.
 TROI / Yes, as part of a nightmare of disjointed images, half-heard voices. He is in another dimension -- seeing us across a great chasm -- and he's filled with remorse at what he has witnessed, and he's afraid.
 PICARD / What is he afraid of?
 PICARD / (continuing; back to P2) Damn you -- help me! Why did you leave the ship?
 TROI / It's no use, Captain. He can't answer.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Are you still convinced he is me?
 TROI / Yes -- but you're not.
 PICARD / Not in the slightest. Except for his features there is nothing about him which I find familiar.
 PICARD / (continuing) I want you to stay with him. He will be able to communicate with you before any of the rest of us.
 TROI / He is handling it very well.
 TROI / Yes. Because of what... (indicating P2) ... he represents.
 TROI / Doubt. Seeing him here and knowing what happened to the Enterprise could make him timid or, worse, cause him to hesitate.
 TROI / It's his accurate feelings.
 TROI / Doctor, the captain is fully capable of command decisions.
 TROI / Yes, which is necessary and healthy.
 TROI / I do not think that will be necessary.
 PICARD / What force or phenomenon could cause a shuttle to be thrown back in time?
 RIKER / None that we have ever encountered. In theory, accelerating beyond warp ten.
 PICARD / Using the gravitational pull of a star to "slingshot" back in time. Is that what happened here?
 RIKER / The shuttle doesn't have warp capability.
 PICARD / No. Some external force was needed.
 RIKER / We have never encountered any natural force that powerful. And why only six hours? Why not a day? A year?
 PICARD / Are you suggesting there is a conscious mind at work here?
 RIKER / There is no evidence either way.
 PICARD / The Traveler moved through time with the power of his mind.
 RIKER / I don't think that's the case here.
 PICARD / (frustrated) No -- and Manheim's experiments with gravity and time were rudimentary, and uncontrollable.
 RIKER / Captain, this is one instant where you must suppress your natural tendencies.
 PICARD / Explain.
 RIKER / (then more as a friend than a subordinate, or even a fellow officer) Your strength, Jean-Luc, is your ability to evaluate the dynamics of a situation, step in and make the definitive, preemptive move. You take charge. You're frustrated now because, not only can't you see the solution... you can't even define the problem.
 PICARD / Go on.
 RIKER / This is not place or person we are facing... at least not yet... it's time.
 PICARD / Are you telling me to just sit down -- shut up and wait.
 RIKER / I wouldn't have used those exact words... but, yes.
 PICARD / I don't do that well.
 RIKER / It's your Persian Flaw.
 PICARD / (thoughtfully) Yes -- perhaps it is.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain to the bridge.
 PICARD / Report.
 WORF / This energy vortex appeared out of nowhere. There was no warning.
 RIKER / Well, now at least the waiting is over.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The waiting is over. We have apparently intersected with... something.
 DATA / It is similar to our tractor beam, only much more powerful.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Bridge, this is Engineering.
 RIKER / This is the bridge.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / The pull on the Enterprise is steady. I am having to hold the warp engines at thirty percent, in order to maintain this position.
 PICARD / Transfer engine control to the bridge.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 TROI / There is a consciousness here, Captain. Not thought -- it is more like instinct.
 PICARD / What do you make of it, Number One?
 RIKER / I would say we're being probed.
 DATA / The beam is coming directly from the center of the vortex. Sensors show only massive amounts of energy.
 PICARD / What is it trying to learn?
 TROI / I think it is trying to determine if we are a life force.
 PICARD / (to Riker) We should stay and investigate.
 RIKER / Agreed.
 PICARD / But, was that the mistake?
 PICARD / (continuing) ... staying too long.
 RIKER / Possibly.
 PICARD / We should go now.
 RIKER / Well...
 PICARD / It's the prudent move.
 PICARD / (continuing) I never thought I would hear myself say something like that.
 RIKER / Under the circumstances -- I think you may be right.
 PICARD / But you'd rather stay and find out what it is? What is its intent?
 GEORDI / Engineering, transfer to bridge.
 PICARD / Lieutenant La Forge.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / See if you can get us out of here, Mister La Forge. Maximum warp.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / I have set velocity to warp nine.
 PICARD / Engage.
 GEORDI / The warp engines are at ninety-one percent.
 PICARD / Put it to the wall.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I can't hold it.
 RIKER / Captain! The engines can't take this strain.
 PICARD / All stop.
 PICARD / Status.
 WORF / All decks have reported... no damage -- no injuries.
 GEORDI / The pull on the Enterprise is steady, but much stronger than before. I am at warp seven just to hold this position.
 PICARD / Everything we do tightens its grip. Let's see what we can learn. Launch a Class One probe.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / That was personal.
 GEORDI / Captain -- the power drain needed to hold this position is enormous.
 PICARD / How long can you maintain it?
 GEORDI / A few minutes, then we are going to have to shut down again.
 PICARD / Is he still alive?
 RIKER / Arm photons, Mister Worf, and lock them on the center of the vortex.
 WORF / Photon torpedoes locked on target.
 PICARD / Hold.
 RIKER / We're like a rag in a dog's mouth.
 GEORDI / I am now at maximum warp.
 TROI / It's you, Captain. It was the entire ship, but now it has turned its attention completely on you.
 GEORDI / Captain, I can't hold it. If we don't shut down, we are going to explode.
 PICARD / Counselor, what if I were to leave the Enterprise? Would its attention stay focused on me?
 TROI / Yes. I think it would.
 RIKER / You'd never survive.
 PICARD / But, maybe in those few seconds -- the Enterprise could break free. In any case, that's what he... the other Picard... must have thought.
 RIKER / Captain, where are you going?
 PICARD / Prepare a shuttle, Number One.
 RIKER / You're leaving the ship?!
 PICARD / I have to make a stop in Sickbay. We may be on a road which has no turns.
 PICARD / I know.
 PICARD / Do you know where you are?
 PICARD / But you're only vaguely aware of it. And me -- do you know who I am?
 PICARD / (continuing) No. You don't.
 PICARD / Release him.
 PICARD / No -- release him!
 PICARD / No. Security, this is the captain -- disregard that order. And clear all personnel -- repeat, all personnel -- from Shuttle Bay Two. I don't want any distractions. You... (meaning both Troi and Pulaski) ... stay here.
 PICARD / You have made the decision to leave the ship?
 PICARD / Why?
 PICARD / You're certain.
 PICARD / What's your other option?
 PICARD / You are wrong. Leaving won't save your ship. Don't you remember? It was destroyed -- you saw it happen.
 PICARD / If that's true, then help me. We want the same thing. We want the Enterprise to be safe. There has to be a piece of information which I don't have. What is it?
 PICARD / You?
 RIKER / Captain.
 PICARD / Yes.
 RIKER / We are about to lose warp drive.
 PICARD & P2 / (in sync, they respond to Riker) Understood.
 PICARD / (continuing) When you say it's "you," do you mean it's still you? And it's not me -- just you. Has this entity singled you out -- somehow making a connection?
 PICARD / Wait. You can -- I'll let you, hell, man, I'll go with you, but first tell me. What is -- what was, your other choice?
 PICARD / You don't know what I'm talking about. You're frozen with a single thought -- unable to change -- unable to alter any part of your previous actions.
 PICARD / There must be.
 PICARD / What is it? What would never work?
 PICARD / Destroy the Enterprise -- how?
 PICARD / Tell me -- what was your other choice? We can't escape it -- we can't fight it, we can't go forward.
 PICARD / (realizing) Was that it... Was that the other choice?
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / (continuing) I can't allow it. Before we have any chance of moving forward, the cycle must end.
 PICARD / (touching his communicator) Doctor Pulaski -- report to Shuttle Bay Two.
 PICARD / Bridge.
 PICARD / Number One, we have been wasting our energy trying to escape. It only weakens us. (he moves to his Command Chair) Helm, set a course for the center of the vortex. Lieutenant La Forge, on my command -- I want all the power you can muster.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / We are going into it?
 PICARD / Yes.
 DATA / Course set.
 PICARD / Everyone hold your position -- no matter what. ENGAGE!
 PICARD / What's our position?
 DATA / We are back on course to Endicor.
 RIKER / Stand down from Red Alert.
 PICARD / Explain.
 WORF / All decks have reported in. No damage -- no casualties.
 RIKER / I want a complete check -- all systems.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / You have the bridge, Number One.
 PICARD / Lots of questions, Number One...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... and damn few answers.
 RIKER / Everything about it seemed a tick off.
 PICARD / He certainly did not act like me, at least not the way I think I act.
 RIKER / Maybe none of it was real... we could have just been part of a shared illusion.
 PICARD / Or maybe "he" was thrown back in time so that we would be able to take another road... make another choice?
 RIKER / That suggests a moral force, giving us the opportunity... or specifically giving you the opportunity to right a wrong.
 PICARD / It's said... if you travel far enough you will eventually meet yourself.
 PICARD / (continuing) I will tell you this... it's a very unnerving experience, one I hope never to repeat.
 RIKER / Come.
 RIKER / (continuing) I know you were all disappointed with my last culinary effort.
 WORF / Not all.
 RIKER / Thank you, Worf. Anyway, considering the stress of the last few days, I thought we could use a little diversion and at the same time I could make amends for the 'Owon omelet.
 RIKER / The specialty of the house, Alaskan stew.
 GEORDI / Not with ingredients you picked up at Starbase seventy-three?
 RIKER / No -- I had the computer fabricate everything. The potatoes, the onions, the flour, and the meat.
 WORF / Meat? What kind of meat?
 RIKER / Ahh... Well, to be authentic I needed moose. But, I couldn't find the specific molecular pattern for moose, so I had to improvise. The computer came close...
 RIKER / (continuing) ... actually, it's somewhere between venison -- musk ox -- and Kobe beef.
 WORF / I thought that humans had long ago given up the practice of raising animals for food.
 RIKER / There were a couple of winters when it was either starve or hunt.
 WORF / How fortunate.
 GEORDI / Agreed.
 RIKER / No good, Worf.
 WORF / I appreciate the effort, I would have preferred another omelet.
 RIKER / Sorry. I used the last of 'Owon eggs.
 GEORDI / Thank goodness.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42686.4. We are en route to Starbase Montgomery for engineering consultations prompted by minor readout anomalies...
 DATA / I would consider them insignificant.
 RIKER / What if you're wrong?
 RIKER / (continuing) Sorry. (then) But what if it's more than a mere discrepancy?
 PICARD ENTERS. / 
 GEORDI / Then I'd say we have a problem.
 PICARD / Agreed. We'll have Starbase Montgomery give us an independent reading.
 DATA / Even if the molecular level controls failed, we could recrystallize the dilithium without outside help.
 GEORDI / Data, don't worry. My ego isn't at stake here.
 DATA / Perhaps we could reprogram the system to correct the readout variables --
 PICARD / That's certainly an option, but since we're stopping at Starbase Montgomery anyway, we'll let them do the analysis.
 RIKER / Sir? I don't recall Starbase Montgomery on our mission itinerary --
 PICARD / I think we could all use a twelve-hour layover. Besides, I've just received some personnel transfer directives. Priority matters --
 RIKER / Boarding or disembarking?
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard, we're within hailing range of Starbase Montgomery --
 PICARD / Reduce to impulse power -- (then, to Riker) Meet me in the Observation Lounge when you're done here.
 RIKER / Captain...
 PICARD / Number One, I find myself recollecting the arrival of a new first officer to the Enterprise and a manual docking very confidently achieved. I suspect that I was somewhat miserly in offering congratulations then, so let me make up for it now. Congratulations. The captain of the Starship Ares is retiring. You've been selected as his replacement.
 RIKER / The Ares... she is in Vega-Omicron sector.
 PICARD / And she's picked up indications of an intelligent life-form... but nothing conclusive.
 RIKER / Starfleet will want to know more.
 PICARD / That's why they're asking you, Number One. Not for your military proficiency, but for your skill as an explorer and diplomat.
 RIKER / Vega-Omicron. It'll take months at high warp just to get there.
 PICARD / With no guarantee of finding anything once you arrive. Well, you have twelve hours to think it over. And maybe it's premature, but congratulations, "Captain."
 PICARD / Establish synchronous orbit.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Starbase Montgomery is sending a civilian advisor aboard to brief you on the Ares's mission.
 RIKER / A personal briefing?
 PICARD / Yes. Strategic attache with specialized knowledge of the frontier regions. I think you'll find the briefing... very interesting.
 RIKER / I hope it's complete. Much of my decision will be based on it.
 PICARD / Enjoy...
 RIKER / Ensign --
 RIKER / Dad... ?
 RIKER / You're the civilian advisor? The strategic attache?
 RIKER / It's been fifteen years. Excitement is hardly the appropriate emotion.
 RIKER / I've worked hard.
 RIKER / If you'll excuse me, I've got my duties to attend to. After you've settled in, we'll complete the briefing. (then, to Herbert) Have security send an escort for this gentleman.
 WESLEY / Did you hear about Commander Riker's promotion?
 WORF / Yes.
 WESLEY / He didn't even know his father was coming. It was a complete surprise --
 WORF / So?
 WESLEY / Well, can you imagine if it was your father?
 WORF / I never knew my father.
 WESLEY / And I didn't have one long enough --
 WORF / It is a waste of time to think about such things.
 WESLEY / I'm not thinking about it, really, but everybody needs somebody, don't you think -- ?
 WORF / Enough!
 GEORDI / Starbase Montgomery really didn't have to send me all this help, because we've already checked the entire dilithium spectrum for anomalous frequencies, so don't waste your time on that --
 GEORDI / (continuing) Wes... you okay?
 WESLEY / I was just talking to Worf. (then) He's somewhat eccentric at times.
 GEORDI / That's one word for it.
 WESLEY / But he was so upset -- I must've said something wrong.
 GEORDI / Maybe Worf's not too thrilled with the idea of losing Commander Riker to a new assignment. I'm sure not --
 WESLEY / Neither am I... But I think it's something else with Worf... something's really bothering him.
 RIKER / Family.
 RIKER / So I've heard.
 RIKER / They know each other...
 DATA / And it has nothing to do with Commander Riker's new assignment?
 WESLEY / No. His reaction to that was just the opposite of mine: Completely unaffected.
 GEORDI / You see? With all that's going on, you might be overreacting.
 WESLEY / Really? You try talking to Worf. I'm telling you, he's not... normal... for Worf.
 DATA / There is, of course, a genetic predisposition toward hostility among all Klingons, although Worf does seem unusually out of sorts.
 GEORDI / He's never been much on charm --
 WESLEY / Well, whatever troubles him, we should try to help. He is our friend.
 GEORDI / And I'd like to keep him friendly. (then) Any suggestions?
 DATA / Empirical study. Monitor the subject.
 WESLEY / Right. We'll watch for any signs of unusual behavior --
 GEORDI / That shouldn't be difficult --
 DATA / Within the norms of Klingon patterns, of course. (then) Discretion will be required.
 WESLEY / Fine. Where do we start?
 GEORDI / (re himself and Data) We... will assist you as needed. (then) You found the problem...
 DATA / And you must solve it.
 RIKER / (ignoring that; to Pulaski) You never told me you knew him.
 RIKER / I'm ready for your briefing whenever you are, sir.
 GEORDI / You think Worf is going to appreciate being observed like some laboratory specimen?
 DATA / You are correct. He is not insensitive... particularly at this stage of his development.
 GEORDI / Just remember, this is Wesley's operation, okay?
 DATA / Wesley is quite competent.
 WESLEY / You guys aren't going to believe this...
 GEORDI / Believe what?
 WESLEY / Commander Riker just caught me coming out of the turbolift.
 GEORDI / So? This area isn't off limits to you.
 WESLEY / I know, but I've been working on Paracelsian computations as part of my studies and he wants them right away.
 GEORDI / What about Worf?
 WESLEY / When Commander Riker says right away he means right away.
 DATA / Indeed.
 WESLEY / (re Ten-Forward) You guys can cover for me, can't you?
 GEORDI / Wait a minute. This whole thing --
 WESLEY / I've got to get my computations done.
 GEORDI / You don't expect us to --
 WESLEY / Oh, come on. What are friends for? (to Data) Right?
 DATA / Go ahead. Finish your work and We shall study Worf.
 WESLEY / I knew I could count on you guys!
 GEORDI / Wesley really should be doing this on his own --
 DATA / But he needs his study time --
 GEORDI / I can't believe you fell for that. (then, re Worf) I don't know... he looks pretty normal to me.
 DATA / In solitude there is nothing to trigger unusual behavior.
 GEORDI / (shrugs) Good point. Let's not tamper with the status quo...
 DATA / That would defeat the opportunity for our behavioral research. (then) The probabilities are that he's simply lonely. We can relieve his anxieties through socialization --
 GEORDI / (re Worf) Be my guest.
 DATA / Excuse me, Lieutenant --
 DATA / (continuing) You seem to have lost the will to communicate with others.
 DATA / (continuing) You have friends here. We care about you. Why, just awhile ago, Wesley, Geordi and I were saying how --
 WORF / Sir... with all due respect... BE GONE!
 DATA / He seems quite sincere in his desire for solitude.
 GEORDI / (smugly, the pun intentional) Seeing is believing, huh?
 RIKER / Come in.
 RIKER / Yes, Worf?
 WORF / May I have a moment, sir?
 RIKER / What is it?
 WORF / It is difficult to say... words are not always easy for me... (then, distracted by the pictures) Is that Earth?
 RIKER / Yes. Alaska... I was nine there...
 WORF / (intrigued; re the picture) That is a big fish you are holding.
 RIKER / (re the picture) I didn't even catch that fish.
 WORF / You were holding it like --
 RIKER / I hooked it... but my father took the pole... wouldn't even let me reel it in... he said I might lose it.
 WORF / You do not have good feelings for your father?
 RIKER / I'm... not sure how I feel right now...
 WORF / You have much on your mind.
 RIKER / Yes. (then) What is on yours?
 WORF / The Enterprise has been good to me...
 RIKER / To all of us.
 WORF / It has been my home... but still, I am alone here.
 RIKER / Not true. You have many friends here, just as I have --
 WORF / Then why do you make ready to leave the Enterprise?
 RIKER / I've been offered my own command, something I've trained for...
 WORF / And what of your friends?
 RIKER / Friendship is something we carry in our hearts... We can feel it wherever we are.
 WORF / Yes. On Kling we say, "Tez mrot weilz konpadam": One is always of his tribe. (then) I would like to join you on the Ares.
 RIKER / Thank you, Worf. But I haven't accepted the assignment yet --
 WORF / But sir... it could be a dangerous mission. There may be the potential for combat.
 RIKER / That's not the purpose of the mission.
 WORF / Still -- to die a true hero --
 RIKER / Worf. Your point is made.
 WORF / Then I know you will do the right thing, sir.
 RIKER / I'm here for the briefing, sir.
 RIKER / The mission details could've been transmitted --
 RIKER / Why didn't I ever hear from you?
 RIKER / Excuse me, sir, but I need to study this briefing material...
 TROI / Commander Pulaski's greatest medical skill is her empathy. (then, to Kyle) You must be Commander Riker's father.
 TROI / We've all heard about you. (then) And I've felt certain things.
 TROI / At your service.
 TROI / Because you are intelligent, wise... and quite correct.
 TROI / You're also anxious about something. It's your son, isn't it? You're not as close to him as you'd like to be...
 TROI / I'd like to help if I can. If you allow me.
 TROI / You're not the kind of man who gives up so easily.
 TROI / What is it you want from him?
 TROI / Respect is earned, not bestowed.
 TROI / Perhaps you want him to be proud of you, for you carry great pride in his accomplishments --
 TROI / Yet... You covet his success --
 TROI / True. You are well respected in your field.
 TROI / And false humility.
 TROI / Honesty is the trait he admires. (then) You're very competitive with him, aren't you?
 TROI / Are you sure he'll accept such a dangerous assignment?
 TROI / How can you be so sure?
 PICARD / I've seen your mission briefing.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Any questions?
 RIKER / No sir. (then) Other than a mention of the Ares's first officer.
 PICARD / His name is Flaherty, as I recall.
 RIKER / That's right. The briefing said something about uncanny linguistic skills.
 PICARD / Correct. The last time I saw him, Commander Flaherty spoke over forty languages. Klingon, Romulan, Giamon, and Stroyerian were among the more colorful, as I recall...
 RIKER / He speaks alien dialects?
 PICARD / He has the unique ability of instantaneously interpreting, collating, and extrapolating any verbal communication he hears. (then) You should find him helpful in Sector Vega-Omicron.
 RIKER / I'm sure I will.
 RIKER / Enter.
 PICARD / My only regret is that your reunion will mark Will's farewell.
 PICARD / I have no doubt --
 PICARD / Of course... excuse me, gentlemen...
 RIKER / I won't be pushed into this.
 RIKER / Starfleet does.
 RIKER / I've been on my own since I was fifteen. I can take care of myself.
 GEORDI / Maybe I missed something --
 DATA / The ship's computer would have corrected immediately --
 GEORDI / My inputs could have been in error --
 WESLEY / Geordi! Data! I figured out Worf's problem --
 GEORDI / You spoke to him?
 WESLEY / No, no. I accessed the complete Klingon cultural database. It took some time, but --
 GEORDI / Okay, Wesley. What is the problem?
 WESLEY / It's the tenth anniversary of Worf's Age of Ascension.
 GEORDI / His what?
 WESLEY / The Age of Ascension is a Klingon ritual of great significance. A rite of initiation, marking a new level of Klingon spiritual attainment.
 DATA / Of what significance is the anniversary of this event?
 WESLEY / It's a day of ritual and celebration with one's fellow Klingons... and he doesn't have any Klingon friends.
 GEORDI / But we're his friends --
 WESLEY / But we don't practice Klingon tradition. And we're not Klingons. (then) Worf's feeling socially... culturally isolated.
 GEORDI / Well, what do you suggest? I'm not sure I'd like to invite a bunch of Klingons on board --
 DATA / We can program the ship's computer to provide us with simulations on the Holodeck --
 GEORDI / Holographic Klingons? Sure. Why not?
 DATA / We need only to program the computer with details of the specific ceremony...
 WESLEY / The cultural database said the initiate's family must be present --
 GEORDI / So? We're his family. We'll go. (then) I just wonder what kind of party the Klingons had in mind...
 RIKER / Do you have a minute?
 RIKER / I wanted to apologize for my remarks in Ten-Forward. Your past is none of my business.
 RIKER / Yes. Even if it involves my father.
 RIKER / What woman would have him? With an ego like his --
 RIKER / I never knew that about him.
 RIKER / And you fell in love?
 RIKER / His career.
 WESLEY / Now the Klingon cultural database was very specific on the setting.
 GEORDI / Let me guess: A twenty-piece orchestra in a magnificent ballroom. Everybody in formal wear --
 WESLEY / There's an unusual test of inner strength involved --
 DATA / I believe that will entail the use of Klingon "painstiks."
 GEORDI / "Painstiks"? Sounds lovely --
 DATA / Enduring physical suffering is considered a Klingon spiritual test.
 GEORDI / You mean... for Worf to celebrate the anniversary of his Ascension... he has to be hurt? And we have to witness this?
 DATA / We are his family.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / (continuing) Everything in order, Number One?
 RIKER / I'd be a fool to turn this promotion down, wouldn't I?
 PICARD / I don't know, and if you're asking me what I think you should do, I don't know that either. But I can spell out, albeit crudely, what you are choosing between. (a beat) Your present position as first officer of the Enterprise brings you prestige, distinction, even glamour of a kind. You are the second in command of Starfleet's flagship -- but still, second in command. Your promotion will transfer you to a relatively insignificant ship in an obscure corner of the galaxy, but it will be your ship. Being who you are, that ship will vibrate with your authority, your style, your vision. There is no substitute for being in the center of the stage -- any stage.
 RIKER / I'll need a little more time before I'll have a decision.
 PICARD / Granted.
 GEORDI / Not yet...
 DATA / There is nothing to find.
 GEORDI / Really? How would you like them giving your transporter operation a little once-over?
 GEORDI / You miss the point. It's just the idea that they even suspect a malfunction.
 DATA / Geordi, let them look.
 WESLEY / Chief, will you be able to attend a little party for Worf at seventeen hundred hours?
 GEORDI / It's a surprise, okay?
 RIKER / I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
 TROI / I don't like good-byes. How about "until next time"?
 RIKER / Until next time.
 TROI / It's been a pleasure serving with you, Commander.
 RIKER / That's mutual, Counselor.
 TROI / I'm supposed to know how everyone feels... but I... I can't read you right now.
 RIKER / Maybe your own feelings are getting in the way --
 TROI / My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelings are beside the point --
 RIKER / Not to me. Feelings are what make us human --
 TROI / (then, hopefully) Are you feeling sadness?
 RIKER / Yes.
 TROI / So am I.
 RIKER / Look, I've been giving you my best Academy courtesy -- but it's really time for you to go.
 RIKER / I'm asking you to leave, or I'll --
 RIKER / Really? There is. Deck Twelve. The gymnasium.
 RIKER / You're on.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42686.9. (TO BE DETERMINED)
 DATA / Computer... Is this it?
 GEORDI / Is this really necessary?
 WESLEY / If we're going to get Worf through his problem, it is.
 DATA / Computer... may we please have Klingon personnel appropriate for this event?
 DATA / These images are specifically programmed for Ascension rites.
 GEORDI / Cute bunch.
 WESLEY / And they use those?
 GEORDI / (wincing at that) You don't mean... ?
 DATA / Are we ready?
 WORF / I do not enjoy riddles, Counselor.
 TROI / You will enjoy this one.
 WORF / I am in no mood for trifling or games! Not today!
 TROI / I know what an important day this is for you: The anniversary of your Rite of Ascension.
 WORF / You know about that?
 TROI / Yes. All your friends on board do.
 WORF / That is impossible. The Rite of Ascension is a secret known only to Klingons --
 TROI / -- And certain resourceful young Ensigns...
 WORF / Wesley? What does he know about it -- ?
 TROI / Enough. Now just bear with me.
 WORF / Where are we going?
 TROI / The Holodeck.
 WORF / This truly tries my patience, Counselor.
 TROI / I think you will approve.
 WORF / You are not going in?
 TROI / No.
 WORF / Open.
 WORF / An Ascension ceremony? For me?
 GEORDI / Happy anniversary, Worf.
 WORF / Thank you... oh, thank you!
 DATA / Shall we begin?
 WORF / Oh, yes. Please!
 WORF / DaHjaj SuvwI''e' jIH. tIgwIj Sa'angNIS. 'Iw bIQtIqDaq jIjaH. Today I am a Warrior. I must show you my heart. I travel the river of blood.
 DATA / The true test of Klingon strength is to admit one's most profound feelings... while under extreme duress.
 WORF / jIbechrup may' vIlos.
 WORF / (continuing) The battle is mine. I crave only the blood of the enemy.
 WORF / (continuing) HIHIvqa'.
 WORF / (continuing) The bile of the vanquished flows over my hands.
 WORF / (continuing) may'pequ' moH.
 WORF / (continuing) Thank you, my friends. Thank you... You have my respect. My admiration. My eternal gratitude --
 TROI / Is Worf all right?
 TROI / Then it was a good ceremony?
 TROI / Klingon culture is not to your taste?
 TROI / Have they? Commander Riker and his father are up on the Holodeck about to engage in barbarism of their own.
 TROI / In spite of human evolution, there seem to be certain traits endemic to gender.
 TROI / Males are certainly unique. In adulthood, fathers continue to regard their sons as children... and sons continue to chafe against what they perceive as their fathers' expectations of them.
 TROI / Perhaps that's why men remain so attractive.
 TROI / (touche) As well as his father, I'm sure...
 RIKER / I remember my early lessons.
 RIKER / True. But I've had fifteen years of practice.
 RIKERKYLE / Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu!Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu!
 RIKER / And remembering. (then) You never should've let her die.
 RIKER / Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.
 RIKER / Matta!
 RIKER / I had you.
 RIKER / You've never been hurt by anything.
 RIKER / You had a strange way of showing it.
 RIKER / Why didn't we move away? Start over?
 RIKER / Matta!
 RIKER / You can't do that!
 RIKER / Hachidan kiritsu! That's illegal --
 RIKER / All those years... That's why I could never win... you were cheating!
 RIKER / I always hated that... and you were just cheating! Incredible! How'd you get away with it?
 RIKER / How do you feel?
 RIKER / Really?
 RIKER / I know. (then) I'm glad you came.
 WORF / Starbase Montgomery briefing specialist and analytical team have beamed down, sir.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) What were the analytical team's findings?
 GEORDI / They suggested we reprogram the system to correct the readout variables.
 PICARD / Precisely what Data recommended, as I recall. But it did give Commander Riker the time he needed to consider his promotion. Now that he's accepted it, we can leave him at Starbase Montgomery.
 PICARD / Number One?
 RIKER / Captain... with your permission, I've decided to remain on the Enterprise.
 PICARD / ... granted.
 RIKER / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / (continuing) Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Terminating synchronous orbit.
 RIKER / Set course for Beta Kupsic... That is still our next destination?
 RIKER / (continuing) ... Velocity - warp factor five.
 WESLEY / Course and speed set.
 PICARD / (there is a pause) Any particular reason for this change of heart?
 RIKER / Motivated self-interest. Right now the best place for me to be is right here.
 PICARD / (then to Conn) Engage.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42680.3. We are the first manned vessel to enter the Selcundi Drema quadrant. Previous unmanned probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. I am hoping the Enterprise will find the answer to this engima.
 RIKER is in the command position. WORF and DATA are at / their respective stations. Supernumeraries at other positions.
 DATA / Commander, I have been reviewing the unmanned probe scans. In the past one hundred and fifty years, the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema has shattered, forming an asteroid belt.
 RIKER / I'd call that geological instability.
 WORF / Is there any indication that this is the work of an unknown intelligence?
 RIKER / I think this is geology, not malevolence. These planets live fast and die hard. The question is why.
 PICARD and TROI come walking down the corridor toward / the Holodeck doors. He is dressed for riding in breeches, high boots, sweater. Hunt cap beneath his arm, gloves, whip.
 PICARD / You're sure you won't reconsider?
 TROI / No, I'll watch you and be impressed.
 PICARD / An optimistic vote of confidence from the non-rider.
 TROI / I've never thought of you as particularly an animal person.
 PICARD / Small animals, no, but horses --
 PICARD / (continuing) Computer, program Holodeck for a woodland setting with a bridle path and an appropriate mount.
 PICARD / (impatiently) A horse, an Earth horse.
 PICARD / Arabian. (to Troi) The Arabs believed that Allah gathered the south wind and made the horse.
 TROI / On the Holodeck we've made that legend come true.
 PICARD / I like that. Oh yes, computer, English tack, and I will control the animal myself.
 PICARD / Hello, my beauty.
 TROI / So you like horses for the romance?
 PICARD / It goes deeper than that. A fine war mare would sleep in a bedouin's tent, carry him into battle, feed his children with her milk. There is a bond which forms from mutual need.
 TROI / Now I understand. You don't want the comfort of a pet. You want a companion.
 TROI / (continuing) I had a Betazoid kitten once. My mother and the cat reacted... badly to one another.
 TROI / (continuing) Captain, my mother and I share a bond. She is going through a difficult time, and I may need to be with her.
 PICARD / If you want leave, you need only ask.
 TROI / Thank you, sir, I appreciate that.
 PICARD / (indicating the horse) You're sure you won't try? It's a good way to relax. We can get you something quiet and gentle.
 TROI / No, no. I prefer a mode of transportation that doesn't have a mind of its own.
 PICARD / Strange. I should have thought that Betazoids would be outstanding animal trainers.
 TROI / We become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions of the beast. We lose our way and become swept up in emotionalism.
 PICARD / I should think the shifting passions of... (he taps his chest) ... this beast would be far more terrifying.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain.
 PICARD / Yes, Number One?
 RIKER / We've entered the first system. I think you might want to come to the bridge.
 PICARD / Something interesting?
 RIKER / Spectacular and a little terrifying.
 PICARD / On my way. (he pats the horse's neck) Later, old girl.
 RIKER / This is our first long-range reading, extremely high magnification.
 PICARD / Quite impressive.
 RIKER / And deadly. The last unmanned probe showed a thriving ecosystem. Now there's nothing.
 PICARD / This is Commander Riker's meeting.
 RIKER / I need your advice and recommendations. I was given the responsibility of overseeing Wesley's education. To further that goal I want to put him in command of the planetary mineral surveys.
 RIKER / The game's not big enough if it doesn't scare you a little.
 GEORDI / To do the job, Wesley's going to need a team. It takes command presence to lead. Is he ready for that?
 TROI / Leadership grows from self-confidence which is also part of a Starfleet officer's education.
 PICARD / All of this is true, but there is an old horse trainer's adage about putting too much weight on a young back -- we don't want him to break under the pressure.
 RIKER / Both.
 TROI / You can't guide someone into adulthood. The experiences are unique to each person. Whether Wes succeeds or fails, he will learn from the experience.
 GEORDI / You think we're pushing him too hard?
 PICARD / Tempering is done in extremes.
 PICARD / Who will someday be a man and need a fine edge that will hold, that won't dull at the first touch of resistance.
 RIKER / Sooner or later he's got to feel the burden of command.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Mister Crusher to the Observation Lounge.
 RIKER / Wesley, I'm placing you in command of the planetary mineral surveys.
 WESLEY / Sir! Um... thank you, sir.
 RIKER / You may not thank me once you see how much work it entails. Assemble your team, and take a look at the records on the Drema quadrant. We've got a mystery to solve here.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir. A team, sir?
 PICARD / Ensign, this is a serious responsibility.
 WESLEY / I know, sir.
 PICARD / These officers are here to assist you. Not judge, but help. I suggest you use them; they are a valuable resource. And by the way, I have more respect for an officer who knows when to admit ignorance and ask a question than one who, out of pride, will blunder blindly forward.
 WESLEY / I understand.
 RIKER / You're dismissed, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / I'll try not to disappoint you
 WORF / Is this part of your regular duties?
 DATA / No, a personal project. I have just reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside their usual range.
 WORF / Such as?
 DATA / The dips and peaks of the galaxy's magnetic field, organic molecules in nebular clouds, energetic cosmic rays.
 WORF / Interesting. Would these scans also detect artificial transmissions as well as naturally occurring signals?
 DATA / Of course.
 WORF / Good.
 DATA / Those signals are very faint and difficult to distinguish from background noise, which is why I am boosting the power.
 DATA / (continuing) I will be removing this equipment to my quarters.
 WORF / Good!
 WESLEY / Hi, may I walk with you? I need a little advice.
 TROI / Yes.
 RIKER / And it's free.
 WESLEY / Walking or advice?
 RIKER / Both.
 WESLEY / It's about my team. I'm considering so many factors I'm confusing myself.
 TROI / What have you done so far?
 WESLEY / Broken down the task and picked the best people in those disciplines.
 RIKER / Who have you got so far?
 WESLEY / Prixus for mineralogy and metallurgy, Alans and Hildebrant, volcanology and geo-mechanics, and I want Davies for geo-chemistry, but --
 TROI / But they're all older than you?
 WESLEY / Yeah, it makes me feel awkward. And what about compatibility --
 RIKER / (interrupting) Completely irrelevant. They're professionals. And if there are personality conflicts, you resolve them. You're in charge.
 WESLEY / So you not only have to understand the job, you have to be a ship's counselor.
 TROI / Sometimes.
 WESLEY / Well, thanks.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42680.7. We are entering the second Selcundi star system. I believe the volatility of these planets originated in the primordial gas cloud which formed them five billion years ago.
 DATA / Computer, identify.
 DATA / Is there a pattern?
 DATA / Naturally occurring?
 DATA / Key universal translator.
 DATA / Lock on com link and boost.
 DATA / Read.
 WESLEY / Ensign Davies?
 WESLEY / Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / (continuing) I've been put in charge of the planetary survey, and I'd like to have you on the team.
 WESLEY / Prixus and Hildebrant and Alans.
 WESLEY / Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
 WESLEY / Uh... thanks, but I think I'll be okay.
 DATA / Enhance.
 DATA / Yes.
 WESLEY / Hi, Doctor Pulaski.
 WESLEY / My team's in there. I've got to assign planets, set a schedule.
 WESLEY / But I haven't had to deal with them. Not all together. Not professionally.
 WESLEY / Only because Commander Riker says I do.
 PICARD (V.O.) / It has been six weeks since our entrance into the Selcundi Drema quadrant. Each system has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet.
 PICARD / Feels good, doesn't it? You're a lovely darling.
 WESLEY / I agree. Nice job.
 WESLEY / Didn't you tell me that U.V. absorption readings like these are indicative of traker deposits?
 WESLEY / Then don't you think we ought to run an Ico-spectrogram?
 WESLEY / (hesitantly) I think I'd still run the Ico-gram.
 WESLEY / I know, I just don't want to do the job halfway.
 WESLEY / Well, maybe you're right.
 DATA / Access all volcanic and tectonic plate activity of Drema Four.
 DATA / Computer, locate Captain Picard.
 DATA / I am sorry to disturb you, Captain.
 PICARD / Quite all right. It must be important, or you wouldn't be here.
 DATA / Yes, Captain, it is important. Very. Eight weeks ago I received a transmission -- a simple four word message: "Is anybody out there?" I answered it.
 DATA / (continuing) I could not help myself.
 PICARD / There is a loneliness inherent in that whisper in the darkness.
 DATA / Yes, I am glad that you understand.
 PICARD / (gently) But it didn't stop there.
 DATA / (sighs) No. I have been drawn into her life.
 PICARD / To what degree is this involvement?
 DATA / We have been communicating regularly.
 PICARD / Dear heaven, you've got a pen pal. Does this society have any idea that there is interstellar life?
 DATA / No.
 PICARD / Merde. Just where does she think you're calling from?
 DATA / I have kept that somewhat vague. But Sarjenka has been quite specific, telling me detailed stories of her family and friends. It was fascinating, but among these confidences were interspersed alarming references.
 PICARD / Go on.
 DATA / Captain, Drema Four is enduring the same geological stresses we have found in the other systems.
 PICARD / Then your pen pal is in trouble.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / What are you proposing?
 DATA / If we can determine the cause of the geological instability, we might be able to reverse the process.
 PICARD / And violate the Prime Directive.
 DATA / I was hoping that you might have an option.
 PICARD / (almost to himself) We don't even know if this catastrophe is preventable. (a beat) Call a conference in my quarters. All senior staff.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / And Data, all communication with this life-form must stop.
 DATA / (softly) Yes, sir. I understand.
 RIKER / (to the woman) Will you excuse me?
 RIKER / (continuing) You have the look of someone who didn't come up here to relax.
 WESLEY / No, sir, I need your advice.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Yesterday Ensign Davies turned in his survey results. I thought he should run an Ico-spectrogram. He didn't agree.
 RIKER / Did you think you were right?
 WESLEY / Well, yeah, I guess. Or I could have just been picking nits.
 RIKER / Or perhaps intimidated? It's tough to tell people what to do.
 WESLEY / I suppose I could have made it an order, but that's the hard part. How do I give orders to somebody older and more experienced then me?
 RIKER / Your and Davies's relative ages aren't the issue here. Are they?
 WESLEY / I guess not.
 RIKER / Do you think it might have something to do with ego?
 WESLEY / Maybe the opposite of ego. Every time I give an order, there's this part of me that's asking what makes my judgment so superior to this other person's.
 RIKER / Wes, authority and responsibility go hand in hand. I know you're responsible, now you have to learn to handle authority. You've been put in command so you can make a few right decisions. That will establish a pattern of success and build your self-confidence. That's why I said this was about ego. If you don't trust your own judgment, you don't belong in the command chair.
 WESLEY / But what if I'm wrong?
 RIKER / Then you're wrong. It's arrogant to think you'll never make a mistake.
 WESLEY / But what if it's something really important -- not just a mineral survey, and what if someone ends up dead because of my mistake?
 RIKER / In your situation you only have to do one thing: Ask yourself, what would Picard do?
 WESLEY / He'd listen to all the opinions, then make the decision. But he's Picard.
 RIKER / Doesn't matter. Would anyone argue with the captain once his decision was made?
 WESLEY / No way.
 RIKER / Why not?
 WESLEY / I'm not sure.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker, report to the captain's quarters.
 RIKER / When you've worked it out, you'll understand command.
 RIKER / (continuing) On my way.
 RIKER / (continuing) I hope I've helped. Let me know what you decide.
 WESLEY / I've already decided. I'm going to have Davies run that Ico-gram. (he smiles) And thank you, sir.
 RIKER / You're welcome.
 WESLEY / Ensign Davies, I want that Ico-spectrogram run on the Selcundi Drema system.
 PICARD / You see the dilemma?
 WORF / There are no options. The Prime Directive is not a matter of degree. It is an absolute.
 PICARD / Doctor, I'm sure the lieutenant did not intend it in that way. In this situation we must use caution. Our actions could have a profound effect upon the future. If we could see all possible outcomes --
 RIKER / We would be gods, but we're not. If there is some cosmic plan, isn't it the height of hubris to presume that we can, or should, interfere?
 GEORDI / So what are you saying? That the Dremans are fated to die?
 RIKER / It's something that needs to be considered.
 GEORDI / (with heat) Well, consider it considered, and rejected.
 TROI / If there is a cosmic plan, are we not part of it? Our presence at this place at this moment in time might be part of that fate.
 GEORDI / (eagerly) So it might be part of the plan that we interfere.
 RIKER / I think that eliminates the idea of "fate."
 DATA / Doctor, you quote Thomas Mann, and Commander Riker could no doubt cite Euripides to support his position, but all of this is just philosophy. Sarjenka is not a subject for philosophical debate, she is a person.
 PICARD / So Doctor, you draw the line at the death of millions.
 PICARD / Same situation if it's an epidemic rather than a geological catastrophe?
 PICARD / How about a war? A generations-long conflict that is killing millions. Do we interfere?
 PICARD / (continuing) Now we're less secure in our moral certitude. And what if it's not death. What if it's an oppressive government which is enslaving millions?
 PICARD / (continuing) The Prime Directive serves many purposes. Not the least of which is to protect us. It keeps us from allowing our emotions to overrule our judgement.
 WORF / To Data.
 GEORDI / If the Dremans asked for our help?
 DATA / (eagerly) Yes, Sarjenka's transmission could be viewed as a call for help.
 PICARD / That's sophistry and you know it.
 WORF / She cannot ask for help from people she does not know.
 DATA / She knows me.
 RIKER / What a perfectly vicious little circle.
 PICARD / (to Data) I want you to sever the remaining com link with Drema Four.
 DATA / Captain, to maintain contact without subspace radio capability required the computer to remotely scan all subspace resonance in her area. If I break that link the probability of relocating her signal falls to one in twenty-three million...
 DATA / (continuing) We are going to allow her to die, are we not?
 PICARD / Wait.
 PICARD / (continuing; very weary) Oh, Data.
 PICARD / (continuing) That whisper in the dark has become a plea. We cannot turn our backs.
 RIKER / We've found the reason for the geological instability.
 PICARD / Excellent.
 WESLEY / Drema Four has the largest deposit of dilithium ore ever recorded. It's also laid down in a very unusual pattern. The crystals are growing to form perfectly aligned lattices.
 PICARD / In plain English this means that the dilithium is causing the geological catastrophe?
 PICARD / All right, we know the why. Now what can we do?
 RIKER / That's going to take a little more work.
 PICARD / Can we reverse the process?
 WESLEY / (cautiously) We think so.
 PICARD / No theories or half answers. Yes or no.
 RIKER / Data's out there... (indicates the bridge with a head jerk) ... monitoring conditions on Drema Four. The situation's becoming pretty desperate for his friend. He's calculated the safest locations on the planet's surface. You can guess why.
 PICARD / We just keep getting in deeper and deeper, don't we?
 RIKER / She's going to die. They're all going to die.
 PICARD / Unless.
 RIKER / Yes... unless.
 PICARD / You may tell Commander Data that he has my permission to contact his friend and guide her to a safer location.
 PICARD / (continuing) Do you know where we are now, Number One?
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / Up to our necks.
 DATA / Sarjenka, this is Data. Respond please.
 DATA / Reason for failure?
 WORF / We are modifying Class One probes so they become resonators. We will then use torpedo casings to protect the probes once they begin burrowing beneath the surface.
 PICARD / How do these resonators destroy the crystals?
 WORF / The Enterprise will monitor and adjust the frequency of the resonators.
 RIKER / (to Hildebrant and Worf) It sounds like a plan. Get started on it.
 PICARD / Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
 DATA / Captain, permission to beam down to Drema Four.
 PICARD / What?
 DATA / I have been unable to contact Sarjenka.
 PICARD / I know you're worried, but transporting to the surface is only going to make a bad situation worse.
 DATA / I feel it is important to determine the reason for --
 RIKER / (interrupting) Come on, Data!
 DATA / (to Picard) Sir, your orders were to deliver the message, correct?
 PICARD / Yes.
 DATA / So what is the difference whether I send the message or deliver it personally?
 RIKER / A whopping big one, and you know it.
 DATA / (to Picard) We have come this far.
 PICARD / In for a penny, in for a pound, is that what you're saying, Mister Data?
 PICARD / (continuing) Oh hell.
 PICARD / (continuing) Go.
 DATA / (not quite believing it) Sir?
 PICARD / Go. Handle the transport, Number One.
 RIKER / Now where would you say we are?
 RIKER / O'Brien, take a nap. You didn't see this, you're not involved.
 RIKER / Ten minutes, Data, that's it, and if you meet anybody but Sarjenka --
 DATA / I will signal for immediate beam out.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker to the bridge.
 RIKER / Damn!
 RIKER / You know what to do?
 DATA / Sarjenka, wait!
 DATA / (continuing) Do not be afraid. I am Data.
 DATA / There is no time for explanations. You and your family must leave.
 DATA / (confused) Then why are you here?
 DATA / (distractedly) Yes, well, I am sorry about that, but it is very complicated -- Does your family know where you are?
 DATA / (looking outside) You cannot survive in this.
 DATA / Enterprise, two to beam up.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / Where is Commander Riker?
 DATA / To the bridge.
 DATA / Leave her here?
 DATA / (to O'Brien) Quite impossible.
 WORF / Sir, we are three minutes from resonator launch.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Where is he?
 RIKER / He'll be here.
 PICARD / He has brought that child aboard my ship and onto my bridge.
 RIKER / I'm sure Data will have a very good explanation.
 DATA / She was frightened and did not want to be left alone
 PICARD / Mister Data, would you kindly assume your station.
 PICARD / (continuing) Counselor, escort her to Sickbay.
 TROI / (reaching the pair) It's all right, nobody's going to hurt you.
 TROI / (continuing) We'll go and get a treat, and --
 DATA / Captain, I will not allow her to be in the way.
 WORF / Two minutes to resonator launch.
 TROI / Little one, hush, it's all right.
 DATA / Counselor, allow me. Please.
 DATA / (continuing) Hush, it is all right now. No one will harm you. These are my friends.
 PICARD / Take your station, Mister Data, and keep her with you. This does directly concern her.
 WORF / Thirty seconds to resonator launch.
 DATA / (to Sarjenka) I require my hand now.
 WORF / Firing torpedoes.
 DATA / Sensors locked on probes.
 WORF / Torpedos have reached their targets...
 DATA / Resonators activated. Harmonic sequences have begun.
 DATA / We are attempting to quiet your planet. If we succeed, there will be no more quakes, no more volcanos.
 PICARD / (to Wesley) When should the results become evident?
 WESLEY / Very quickly, sir.
 DATA / If our experiment...
 DATA / (continuing) They will soon be safe.
 DATA / (continuing) Captain, sensors indicate a planetwide reduction in tectonic stress levels.
 WESLEY / It's working. We did it!
 DATA / Sarjenka, look.
 DATA / (continuing) Starboard view.
 DATA / (continuing) There, there are your stars.
 DATA / (continuing) What are you thinking?
 PICARD / Data, take Sarjenka to Sickbay.
 DATA / Sir, must we?
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Data and the alien are on their way down. What would be involved in removing all memory of her communication with Data and her visit to this ship?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Well, do your best.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / I am certain you could.
 DATA / There are many things in life which we desire but will never receive. This is one of them.
 DATA / Sarjenka, this is Doctor Pulaski.
 DATA / It does not sing for me.
 DATA / Because I am a machine.
 DATA / But are we doing a good thing now?
 DATA / By robbing her of her memories?
 RIKER / Sit down.
 WESLEY / No thank you sir. It's going to be a long time before I'm really qualified to sit here.
 RIKER / You did a good job, Wes. I'm proud of you.
 WESLEY / Thank you, sir.
 WESLEY / (continuing) Does it get any easier?
 RIKER / No.
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / I came to thank you.
 PICARD / No thanks are necessary. You reminded us that there are obligations beyond duty.
 DATA / You did not have to hold that conference. Your decision could have been unilateral.
 PICARD / One of my officers...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... One of my friends was in trouble. I had to help him.
 DATA / I am going to miss her, Captain.
 PICARD / That too is part of friendship, remembrance and regrets.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / And understanding that has taken you a step closer to humanity.
 GEORDI is coming down the corridor, he sees a young twenty / five to twenty eight year old ensign -- who has newly arrived on the Enterprise. She is very energetic, and enthusiastic in an open and ingenuous way, which is both appealing and refreshing. Her name is SONYA. She is standing in front of a food dispenser panel.
 GEORDI / We don't ordinarily say "please" to food dispensers.
 GEORDI / For someone who has just arrived, you certainly aren't shy with your opinions.
 GEORDI / No.
 GEORDI / I know -- that's why you got this assignment.
 GEORDI / I know, you're excited. Sonya.
 GEORDI / I don't think you want to bring that hot chocolate around these control stations.
 Then as she turns around she crashes right into CAPTAIN PICARD. / 
 GEORDI / Actually it's my fault, sir...
 PICARD / Yes, I'm aware of how often you order picnics to be held in here.
 PICARD / Yes, Ensign. It's all over me.
 PICARD / Ensign... ah...
 GEORDI / Ensign Gomez is a recent Academy graduate. She transferred on at Starbase one seventy three.
 PICARD / Ensign... (restraining her) I think it would be simpler if you let me change my uniform?
 GEORDI / Captain, I really have to accept responsibility for this.
 PICARD / Yes, Chief Engineer. I believe I do understand now.
 PICARD / I'm sure you will. Carry on.
 GEORDI / I'll give you this... it's a meeting the captain won't soon forget.
 PICARD / Deck nine. Officers' quarters.
 PICARD / Crewman? What's going on?
 PICARD / Q.
 PICARD / We agreed you would never trouble my ship again!
 GEORDI / I read your graduating thesis. I wouldn't have requested you if you weren't the best.
 GEORDI / To Ten-Forward. We're going to forget about work. We are going to sit, talk, relax, look at the stars. You're going to learn to slow down.
 GEORDI / (gently) You're awfully young to be so driven.
 GEORDI / (grinning) Geordi
 GEORDI / The Grand Unified Theory and Supersymmetry hasn't been seriously discussed for years.
 GEORDI / You're more than a scientist you're a philospher.
 GEORDI / Sonya, it's going to be there for you. Believe me. (a beat) I promise, I won't let anything exciting slip past without letting you know.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / I understand that you're excited -- so was I. This is your first assignment, everything is new, you are eager and that's great, but...
 GEORDI (O.S). / Do me a favor... for a minute, just listen.
 RIKER / Guinan?! I don't believe you've ever called the bridge before.
 RIKER / How do you mean?
 RIKER / (looks around) Anyone notice anything unusual? (waits, then) No Guinan, nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask?
 PICARD / Enterprise -- this is Picard.
 PICARD / Stop this foolishness, Q. Return me to the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Keeping me a prisoner out here will not force me to discuss anything with you.
 GEORDI / Guinan?
 GEORDI / No -- we're fine. Is everything all right?
 GEORDI / (gets up) I think I'll go check out Engineering.
 TROI / Where's the captain?
 RIKER / In his Ready Room.
 TROI / Captain -- this is Counselor Troi.
 RIKER / Computer -- locate Captain Picard.
 WORF / Commander, there is a shuttle missing from Shuttle Bay Two.
 RIKER / All stop.
 WESLEY / Answering all stop.
 WORF / I have hailed the shuttle on all frequencies -- no response.
 DATA / Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector.
 RIKER / We must assume the captain is onboard the shuttle.
 WESLEY / But, how could he get to the shuttle bay, how could he leave the Enterprise without us knowing? It's not possible.
 RIKER / Take it easy, Wes. We'll find him. I want to begin a methodical search. Sensors on maximum scan We'll use our present location as the center. Data plot a search pattern from our present coordinates which will cover the most area in the shortest time.
 DATA / The search pattern has been input.
 RIKER / Engage, Mister Crusher.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log. Stardate (xx). We have not been able to determine why, or how, Captain Picard left the Enterprise. We can't even be certain he is in the missing shuttle, although that is the assumption on which we are proceeding. For the last six hours we have been searching without success.
 DATA / We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a vessel without warp drive could traverse in the time allotted.
 RIKER / Widen the area...
 PICARD / Then the Enterprise will continue on with Riker as captain. Return me to my ship.
 WORF / Commander. My status board indicates that the shuttle is back in Shuttle Bay Two.
 RIKER / Computer -- locate Captain Picard.
 PICARD / You know him.
 PICARD / You're speaking of yourself, Q -- not Guinan.
 PICARD / Guinan's not the issue here -- you are... We had an agreement that you would stop meddling with us.
 PICARD / What do you want, Q? State your business and let's get on with it.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Which is?
 RIKER / To join us as what?
 RIKER / Homeless?
 RIKER / So, the other members of the Q continuum kicked you out.
 PICARD / Join us as what? To do what? Would you start as an ordinary crewman -- what task is too menial for an entity?
 PICARD / Not at all. That is the last thing I would do. You, by definition are part of our charter. Our mission is to go forth -- to seek out new and different life forms, and you certainly qualify as one of the most unique life forms I have ever encountered. To learn more about you is frankly quite provocative, but you are next of kin to chaos.
 RIKER / The good times!? The first time we met you put us on trial for the "crimes of humanity"...
 RIKER / The next time we saw you, you asked me to join the Q continuum.
 PICARD / ... and now you say you want to join us.
 PICARD / No.
 RIKER / Fairness?! You disrupt this ship -- kidnap the captain!
 PICARD / Simply stated -- we don't trust you.
 PICARD / I don't know that we are prepared, but I do know that we are ready to confront it.
 PICARD / Absolutely. That's why we are out here.
 PICARD / By whose calculation?
 RIKER / I guess we'll just have to get along the best we can without you.
 PICARD / We're not smug -- nor arrogant. We are resolute and we are willing. But more than that we are determined. Your help is not required.
 PICARD / Bridge this is the captain -- all stop.
 WESLEY COM VOICE / Answering all stop.
 PICARD / Status.
 DATA COM VOICE / According to these coordinates we have traveled seven thousand light years, and are located near system J-two-five.
 RIKER / Estimate travel time to the closest starbase.
 DATA COM VOICE / At maximum warp, in two years, seven months, three days, eighteen hours we would reach Starbase one eight five.
 RIKER / Why?
 PICARD / Guinan, have your people been in this part of the galaxy?
 RIKER / What can you tell us?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The entity Q has flung the Enterprise to a distant part of the galaxy, which we are going to take the opportunity to explore.
 WORF / Captain, the sixth planet in the system is Class M.
 DATA / There is a system of roads on the planet which indicate a highly industrialized civilization. But where there should be cities there are only great rips in the surface.
 WORF / It is as though some great force just scooped all machine elements off the face of the planet.
 DATA / It is identical to what happened to the outposts along the Neutral Zone.
 WORF / We are being probed.
 RIKER / What's the source of the probe?
 WORF / A ship. It is on an intercept course.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / Full scan. Go to Yellow Alert.
 WORF / Going to Yellow Alert.
 RIKER / Keep the shields down -- we don't want to appear provocative.
 PICARD / Data, what can you tell us?
 DATA / The ship is strangely generalized in design. There is no specific bridge or central control area, no specific engineering section -- I can identify no living quarters.
 RIKER / Life signs?
 DATA / There is no indication of specific life.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Worf, what is its alert status?
 WORF / I detect no shields, no weapons of any known design.
 PICARD / Hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Open.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / Guinan.
 PICARD / Activate your viewscreen -- I want you to monitor what's going on up here. I may need your input.
 PICARD / You are acquainted with this life form?
 RIKER / Shields up.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / Security to Main Engineering -- we have an intruder.
 WORF / He came right through the shields!
 PICARD / What do you want?
 PICARD / We mean you no harm. Do you understand me?
 PICARD / Stop -- we cannot allow you to interfere with the operation of this ship.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf.
 PICARD / Worf -- use whatever means to neutralize the intruder.
 PICARD / Because her people had contact with the Borg, I have requested that Guinan participate in this conference. You are aware of what just occurred in Main Engineering.
 PICARD / Tell, us exactly what happened between your people and the Borg.
 RIKER / Guinan, if they are that aggressive, then I wonder why neither Borg attacked? They could have -- but they didn't.
 DATA / Then the initial encounter was solely for the purpose of gathering information.
 PICARD / How do we reason with them? Let them know that we are not a threat?
 WORF COM VOICE / Captain, we are being hailed.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the...
 PICARD / Counselor.
 TROI / You are not dealing with an individual mind. They do not have a single leader. It is the collective minds of all of them.
 PICARD / That would have some definite advantages.
 TROI / Yes. A single leader can make errors. It is less likely for the combined whole.
 WORF COM VOICE / Captain -- they have locked onto us with some form of tractor beam.
 PICARD / We're on our way.
 DATA / Whatever this beam is, Captain, it is draining our shields.
 RIKER / If they pull down our shields we're helpless.
 PICARD / On any heading -- warp eight engage.
 WESLEY / It's holding us here!
 RIKER / Increase power!
 WORF / The shields are weakening.
 DATA / In eighteen seconds the shields will be down.
 PICARD / Locate the exact source of the tractor beam -- lock on phasers.
 WORF / Phasers locked on target.
 PICARD / Fire.
 WORF / They still have us.
 DATA / Shields are down.
 WORF / A type of laser beam is slicing into the Saucer Section.
 RIKER / They are carving us up like a roast.
 PICARD / With whatever force you need terminate that beam.
 PICARD / Fire!
 DATA / The tractor beam has released.
 RIKER / Damage report.
 WORF / Sections twenty-seven, twenty-eight and twenty- nine on Decks four, five and six destroyed.
 PICARD / Casualties?
 WORF / Eighteen were in those sections and are missing.
 RIKER / They couldn't have survived it.
 DATA / A force field is maintaining hull integrity.
 PICARD / What is the condition of their ship?
 WORF / They have sustained damage to twenty percent of their vessel. Life support minimal.
 RIKER / (angry) Why?!
 PICARD / Conference.
 RIKER / Worf -- you had better remain at your station.
 PICARD / Guinan -- what else can you tell us about these creatures?
 PICARD / Anything would be helpful.
 GEORDI / If you can't reprogram them... reroute.
 GEORDI / Push it out of your head.
 RIKER / And you brought us here, exposed us to it, cost us the lives of shipmates...
 PICARD / Number One.
 PICARD / (continuing) Eighteen of our people have died. Please tell us that this is one of your illusions.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / This is Lieutenant La Forge, Captain. We have been able to restore power to the shields.
 PICARD / Very good.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain, I have the casuality list coming on screen.
 PICARD / Cancel -- time for that later.
 RIKER / If there's a chance we are going to have further dealings with the Borg -- now or in the future -- we had better find out as much about them as we can.
 PICARD / Visit their ship?
 RIKER / In my opinion, we have no choice, sir.
 PICARD / (considers it; nods) Agreed. Assemble a minimal away team and take a look at what's over there.
 RIKER / (to com) Mister Worf. Report to Transporter Room 3. (to Data) Data.
 RIKER / Oh, I don't know, Guinan. They visited us... seems only fair that we return the courtesy.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We have been attacked without provocation by an alien race which Guinan calls the Borg. Hopefully, we have neutralized their vessel. Commander Riker is leading an away team in an attempt to learn more about them.
 WORF / There are no life sign readings.
 RIKER / Set phasers on stun, but let's be ready to increase the power if we need it.
 RIKER / Energize.
 RIKER / I wonder why they don't react to us, and why the Enterprise did not read any life signs, especially when there are this many.
 DATA / Perhaps because this ship was scanned for individual life signs. Apparently when they are in these slots, they become part of the whole and no longer read as separate life forms.
 RIKER / (touches his communicator) Captain.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER / Our readings were incorrect... the Borg crew survived, but they are in a kind of stasis.
 PICARD / Explain.
 RIKER / There are slots along the wall, kind of like compartments. There are two Borg in each.
 DATA / Captain, I would theorize that the Borg are somehow interconnected through these slots and are working collectively.
 RIKER / We are going to look for some way to access their main computer.
 DATA / Each slot is designed for a specific Borg. Here is where the connection is made. (he indicates a type  of arm rest)
 RIKER / Like a juggernaut which could start moving at any moment.
 DATA / The technology required to achieve this biological and artificial interface is far beyond our capabilities. There are many advantages.
 RIKER / Speed being the obvious one. This ship literally thinks what it wants to do and it happens.
 DATA / Fascinating. Obviously they also function individually.
 RIKER / And either they don't see us, or don't see us as a threat.
 PICARD / Transporter room, this is the Captain.
 PICARD / If your lock on the away team wavers in the slightest -- beam them back.
 RIKER / Captain -- this is incredible. I have just entered what appears to be the nursery.
 PICARD / Describe it.
 RIKER / From the looks of it the Borg are born as biological life form. Almost immediately after birth they begin getting artificial implants. They have apparently developed the technology to link artificial intelligence directly into a humanoid brain. Pretty astounding. Something else -- I haven't seen any females.
 DATA / Commander.
 RIKER / What is it?
 DATA / The ship appears to be regenerating.
 DATA / Perhaps this explains why they have not taken notice of our presence. Their collective effort is directed at repairing their vessel.
 RIKER / Captain, the Borg are using their combined power to repair the ship.
 PICARD COM VOICE / Transporter Chief, beam the away team directly to the bridge.
 PICARD / Now, Mister Crusher -- engage.
 DATA / Captain -- the Borg ship is in pursuit.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / Increase by ten to the third.
 RIKER / It's continuing to regenerate itself.
 PICARD / Let's see if we can outrun it. (to com) Lietenant La Forge, I want maximum warp for as long as you can hold it.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / We are passing warp eight point five.
 GEORDI / ... warp nine.
 RIKER / Arm the photon torpedoes. Recommend we try to slow them down.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 WORF / Torpedoes armed.
 PICARD / Fire.
 GEORDI / What is it? Is there something the matter?
 GEORDI / Well let's see if we can't raise the level a few more knotches.
 WORF / They had no effect.
 GEORDI COM VOICE / Bridge, this is Engineering. We are at warp nine point six five.
 WORF / The Borg ship is still gaining.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log supplemental. We are unable to maintain the gap between the Enterprise and the Borg ship.
 GEORDI / Agreed. Bridge this is Engineering.
 PICARD COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / You've got all we can give you.
 PICARD / I understand, Lieutenant La Forge.
 WORF / Captain -- the enemy vessel is firing on us.
 WORF / There are no reports of any damage to the Enterprise.
 DATA / The target was not the ship. The weapon was designed to drain the shields.
 WORF / Shield effectiveness has been reduced twelve percent.
 WESLEY / The Borg ship is closing.
 WORF / They are firing again.
 WORF / Shields have been reduced by forty one percent. Another hit and we will be defenseless.
 RIKER / Arm the photon torpedoes.
 WORF / Torpedoes armed.
 PICARD / Fire the photons.
 WORF / The Borg ship was not damaged.
 WORF / The Borg ship is firing.
 WORF / We have again lost the shields.
 GEORDI / Bridge -- we have lost the warp engines.
 WORF / The Borg ship is re-establishing its tractor beam.
 RIKER / Lock on photon torpedoes.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Without our shields -- at this range there is a high degree of probability that a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Prepare to fire.
 PICARD / Q. End this.
 PICARD / If we all die, here and now -- you will never be able to gloat. You wanted to frighten us -- we're frightened. You wanted to show that we are inadequate -- for the moment I will grant that. You want me to say that I need you. Right now -- I need you.
 RIKER / Position.
 WESLEY / Zero-seven-six mark two- two-five -- back where we started.
 PICARD / I understand what you have done here Q, but the lesson could have been learned without the loss of eighteen members of my crew.
 PICARD / Set a course for the closest starbase.
 WESLEY / Course set for Starbase eight three.
 PICARD / They will be coming.
 PICARD / Q might have done the right thing for the wrong reason.
 PICARD / Perhaps we needed a good kick in our complacency to get us ready for what's ahead.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42723.8. The Enterprise is en route to the Epsilon Nine Sector for astronomical survey of a new pulsar cluster. In the meantime, Ensign Crusher will be diverting to Starbase five one five for progressive Starfleet exams...
 RIKER / This just came in from Starfleet--
 WESLEY / (taking the disk) The testing parameters?
 DATA / Do not be apprehensive. I found the Academy examinations quite elementary.
 WESLEY / You would.
 RIKER / Your earlier test results were good enough to get you Academy credit for your work here. I don't think you have anything to worry about.
 WESLEY / But those Academy cadets are pretty competitive, you know.
 RIKER / They don't have your practical experience, Wes.
 DATA / Commander Riker is correct. While the information imparted to cadets at the Academy is unquestionably vital for prospective Starfleet officers, it nevertheless requires a significant period of supplementary systems training and situational disciplines.
 RIKER / Data... isn't that what I just said?
 DATA / Yes, Commander. But not quite as perspicuously.
 PICARD / I won't have you telling me what course to set!
 PICARD / Oh, please. I feel fine.
 PICARD / This ship has a mission to carry out.
 PICARD / I've been looking forward to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster for myself.
 PICARD / Absolutely not.
 PICARD / That's not the point. Not only am I in splendid health, but it would be inappropriate for you to perform the procedure.
 PICARD / Clarify.
 PICARD / I never said that.
 WESLEY / Captain... excuse me.
 PICARD / I understand you're heading for Starbase five one five.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir. I was just on my way to Shuttle Bay Two.
 PICARD / Good. I have some business of my own there. I shall accompany. you.
 WESLEY / You will? (then, composing himself) I mean, yessir!
 PICARD / Prepare the shuttle for immediate departure.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Is there something I can take care of for you at Starbase five one five?
 PICARD / I'm afraid not, Number One.
 RIKER / But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar survey.
 PICARD / I'm very well aware of that. You have the bridge. Carry on.
 PICARD / What is it, Number One?
 RIKER / Is something wrong? This trip to Starbase five one five seems rather unexpected.
 PICARD / Not to worry. Ensign Crusher and I will rendezvous with you on your return from the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster.
 RIKER / Forgive my saying so, sir, but you're being rather enigmatic.
 PICARD / Consider it captain's privilege.
 RIKER / As first officer, I have complete security clearance--
 PICARD / This has nothing to do with ship's business. (then, with a sigh) Suffice it to say that this is strictly a matter of ...vanity.
 GEORDI / Starbase five one five's not exactly around the corner, Wes. You have quite a trip ahead of you.
 WESLEY / Yeah. I know.
 GEORDI / Relax. You'll do fine on your exams.
 WESLEY / It's not the exams I'm worried about. It's Captain Picard.
 WESLEY / He's coming with me to starbase. Just the two of us. Nearly a six-hour transit. What am I going to talk to him about for six hours?
 GEORDI / Nice day for a little trip, Captain?
 PICARD / Hardly.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Shuttle Number Two ready for departure.
 DATA / We are at impulse speed and you are cleared for departure.
 RIKER / Data... wasn't the captain looking forward to this mission to the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster?
 DATA / So he had said.
 RIKER / Then what would make him change his mind? Why would he leave the ship now?
 WORF / Receiving a Mayday on all frequencies, sir!
 RIKER / Source?
 WORF / Rhomboid Dronegar Sector zero-zero-six--
 RIKER / Detail.
 WORF / Ship...unidentified...distress. Nothing more.
 RIKER / Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar zero-zero-six at warp seven.
 DATA / Sir... Rhomboid Dronegar sector will put us at considerable distance from Captain Picard.
 RIKER / I know, Data. I know.
 DATA / Entering Rhomboid Dronegar Sector zero-zero-six.
 WORF / I have a ship on target path.
 RIKER / Slow to impulse speed.
 RIKER / Viewer.
 WORF / Deploy shields, sir?
 RIKER / Hold fast. (then) Data?
 DATA / (re: the ship) Basic early design capable of sub-light travel only.
 WORF / Commander, we are being hailed.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / I am First Officer William Riker. This is the USS Enterprise, responding to your distress signal--
 RIKER / What is your problem?
 RIKER / So are we, but you sent out a Mayday--
 RIKER / Do you need help?
 DATA / Sensors indicate engineering problems.
 RIKER / Lieutentant La Forge to bridge...
 DATA / They have experienced total guidance system failure and they have less than twenty-four hours' reserve power.
 RIKER / (to viewscreen) What brings you so far from home?
 RIKER / What were you looking for?
 RIKER / Can you be more specific?
 RIKER / Then please do so.
 GEORDI / Let me guess: their rubber band broke, right?
 RIKER / (to viewscreen) What is the nature of your mission?
 RIKER / (aside; to Data) Do you hear an echo? (then, back to viewscreen) Understood. Our chief engineer will beam aboard to help you-- (to Worf) Out.
 GEORDI / Wait a minute... me?
 WORF / (re: the viewscreen) Do we truly need to send our chief engineer over to them?
 RIKER / They obviously need our help.
 WORF / Why do we not simply give them the information they need to make their repairs?
 RIKER / Do you honestly think they could handle our technical specifications?
 WORF / We don't know that much about them. I urge caution.
 RIKER / Acknowledged, Worf... but we have an obligation to render aid. (turns to Geordi). Report to the Transporter Room with all necessary gear.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 WORF / We need more information.
 RIKER / Do you have anything else on them?
 DATA / They are a relatively benign species.
 RIKER / Don't they seem a little... slow?
 DATA / They may merely have poorly-developed language skills.
 WORF / What about weapons?
 DATA / Our scan shows very limited armaments.
 RIKER / I think we can relax, Worf. They can't even get their ship moving without our help, and we certainly have them outmanned and outgunned.
 PICARD / E.t.a. thirteen-thirty hours.
 WESLEY / Not exactly warp speed, sir.
 PICARD / More like a late twenty-second century interplanetary journey.
 WESLEY / Sir?
 PICARD / You should read more history, Ensign.
 WESLEY / Yes sir.
 PICARD / (mumbling to himself) Complete waste of time...
 WESLEY / Pardon, sir?
 PICARD / I shouldn't be taking this trip at all. I belong back on the Enterprise.
 WESLEY / Why are you going with me to Starbase five one five, Captain?
 PICARD / (snappish) It's certainly not my idea!
 PICARD / (continuing) I'm sorry. I don't mean to take it out on you. (then) I just hate going through another damned cardiac replacement.
 WESLEY / Cardiac replacement? I didn't know...
 PICARD / Now you do.
 WESLEY / A parthenogenetic implant?
 PICARD / What else would it be? (then, a bit softer) My own heart was injured and a replacement was necessary. That would have been it except that the replacement is flawed and must now be put right.
 WESLEY / Why would anyone use a flawed replacement?
 PICARD / Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign.
 RIKER / All right. Let's get these repairs made so we can all be on our way. (then) First officer to La Forge...
 GEORDI / Aye, Commander. Ready for transport.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Proceed.
 GEORDI / Energize...
 GEORDI / Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm here to help. Take it easy.
 GEORDI / What seems to be the problem?
 GEORDI / Right. I got that already. (then, looking around) Who's in charge of engineering?
 GEORDI / (looking around) Think I could meet him?
 GEORDI / Great...
 GEORDI / Yes, I think you mentioned that.
 GEORDI / So I've heard.
 GEORDI / Well... maybe I can fix it.
 GEORDI / I think so.
 GEORDI / Fellas... why don't you show me where your guidance system is?
 TROI / Commander... Lieutenant La Forge is on an alien ship?
 RIKER / Yes. We're rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks.
 DATA / How they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuine curiosity.
 TROI / Commander... Those aliens... what they feel is not helplessness ... Lieutenant La Forge is in great danger!
 TROI / Danger... great danger...
 RIKER / Can you be more specific, Counselor?
 TROI / They are insincere... It is not our help they want.
 RIKER / Help is all they're going to get. They certainly can't force anything upon us, can they?
 TROI / You feel they are weak.
 RIKER / (re: the viewscreen) Look at them. Not exactly Jarada or Romulans.
 DATA / Our Betazoid counselor is often aware of things beyond our perceptive abilities.
 PICARD / Van Doren's technique has been perfected to two point four percent.
 WESLEY / Sir?
 PICARD / The cardiac replacement procedure. It has a very low mortality rate. Two point four percent.
 WESLEY / Those are pretty good odds.
 PICARD / The fact is, I'm not interested in having my innards become the subject of Starfleet gossip.
 WESLEY / Of course, sir. But why didn't you have Doctor Pulaski perform the operation? You could've trusted her to keep it quiet.
 PICARD / Let's just say I have personal reasons and leave it at that, shall we?
 GEORDI / The power needs to be rerouted through this venturi chamber before it can be channeled through the engine coils.
 GEORDI / But not for long. See? We're going to reconfigure these separators here...
 GEORDI / Actually, any first year engineering intern could do the same thing--
 RIKER (V.O.) / Lieutenant La Forge, this is Commander Riker...
 GEORDI / Yes, Commander. Go ahead.
 RIKER / Are you all right?
 GEORDI / Sure. Why do you ask?
 RIKER / Counselor Troi has expressed misgivings about your absence from The Enterprise.
 GEORDI / I don't think there's much to worry about.
 RIKER / Understood. But as soon as the repairs are completed, I want you back here.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir, I should be done momentarily.
 GEORDI / There. Guidance is up and running.
 GEORDI / Main power failure?
 GEORDI / The guidance system's repaired, but you're not going anywhere without main power.
 GEORDI / Commander Riker, it looks like this might take a little longer than I anticipated...
 WESLEY / You don't really care much for people, do you?
 PICARD / What?
 WESLEY / It's okay. You can just do without most people. I can understand that --
 PICARD / Ensign...Wesley. That's not true. I have great regard for you, for example. You're a fine young man.
 WESLEY / You don't have to say that.
 PICARD / I do not say what I do not mean.
 WESLEY / Well, it's pretty obvious how you feel.
 PICARD / Is it? How so?
 WESLEY / Well, everyone knows. You don't like kids.
 PICARD / I simply have... other priorities.
 WESLEY / That's too bad. (then) You might've made a pretty good father.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 WESLEY / Didn't you ever wish you had kids of your own?
 PICARD / Wishing for a thing does not make it so.
 RIKER / We send him over there for one set of repairs and now they need him for more.
 DATA / Their ship is apparently quite fragile.
 RIKER / This is Riker on board the Enterprise.
 RIKER / (continuing) I repeat. This is Commander Riker of the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / Almost got it, Commander--
 RIKER / Apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repairs.
 RIKER / We will use our tractor beam to tow you to your nearest base.
 RIKER / Yes, but we need our chief engineer back on board our ship--
 GEORDI / All done, Commander.
 RIKER / Prepare to beam over.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / Thanks. We aim to please.
 GEORDI / I'm flattered. Now I hate to repair and run, but if you'll excuse me...
 GEORDI / One to beam aboard--
 GEORDI / Hey!
 RIKER / Transporter room, beam La Forge over immediately.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF (V.O.) / Aye... negative response, sir!
 RIKER / Try again!
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF (V.O.) / Negative response!
 DATA / The Pakled ship has a shield up, sir!
 RIKER / A shield? What kind?
 DATA / It appears to be beyond their technology... similar to Romulan shields!
 RIKER / Do not interfere with our transporter beam. Repeat. Drop your shield--
 RIKER / Status!
 WORF / Viewer transmission terminated and blocked.
 RIKER / Hail on all frequencies.
 DATA / Running frequency search... negative response.
 RIKER / They're ignoring us!
 DATA / Apparently so, sir.
 WORF / Phasers ready, sir.
 RIKER / Shields up.
 WORF / Shields up.
 RIKER / Sensors at maximum sensitivity.
 DATA / Sensors at maximum.
 WORF / Phasers ready, sir.
 RIKER / Hold fire. Lieutenant La Forge is on that ship.
 WESLEY / Were you ever married?
 PICARD / My career always came first. I never had time.
 WESLEY / Don't you ever get lonely?
 PICARD / There have been certain costs involved.
 WESLEY / Well, I'll bet you've broken your fair share of hearts along the way...
 PICARD / A man needs to be careful about that sort of thing.
 WESLEY / Don't worry about me. Where women are concerned, I'm in complete control.
 PICARD / Really? I've always had to work at it.
 WESLEY / Have you always known what you've wanted... been so disciplined?
 PICARD / No. (re his chest) That's why I'm going in to get this thing replaced.
 WESLEY / I don't understand.
 PICARD / Well... I was a young Starfleet officer. Just a few years older than you are now. Green as hell. Top of my Academy Class, and oh, so proud. Too proud, as it turned out.
 WESLEY / What happened?
 PICARD / Several of us were on leave at Far Space Starbase Earhart... something of a galactic outpost in those days--
 WESLEY / Before the Klingons joined the Federation?
 PICARD / That's right. My mates and I were at the Bonestell Recreation Facility, which was nothing more than a crossroads at the time. A trio of Nausicaans came in. They were spoiling for a confrontation with some fresh-faced young Starfleet officers like ourselves. Everyone in our group had the good sense to back away and give these Nausicaans wide berth. Everyone but me, that is. I stood toe-to-toe with the nastiest of the three and let him know what I thought of him, his partners, and his planet. I probably even made some passing reference to his questionable parentage. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / The next thing I knew, I had all three of them on me and I was fighting for my life. Acquitted myself quite well for several furious exchanges, I'm proud to say.
 WESLEY / You fought them? And won?
 PICARD / I had this one Nausicaan down on the floor in a particularly devious joint-lock when before I knew what was happening, one of his cohorts drew his weapon and impaled me through the back. Strange sensation, actually. Not much pain. Shock, certainly, at the sight of serrated metal coming out of one's chest, and then a certain giddy warmth. As I recall, I actually laughed aloud. It pierced my heart, of course, and if we hadn't been so near a medical facility I would surely have died.
 WESLEY / Really? Really? Then what?
 PICARD / Then nothing. I was no hero. I was an undisciplined, opinionated, loud-mouthed young man who was far out of his league. It was a great and painful lesson, but I learned it well. I only hope you won't need to learn it as I did...
 RIKER / Data, come on...
 DATA / I am programming the comm system to scan the interference patterns, but a full analysis will take time.
 GEORDI / Please... no more.
 GEORDI / My VISOR...
 GEORDI / Yes. It allows me to see.
 GEORDI / Where is it? Give it to me--
 GEORDI / (re: the phaser) Be careful with that thing.
 GEORDI / What? I came here to help you. (re: the ship) I fixed your guidance system and the main power generator, didn't I?
 GEORDI / You have a replicator?
 GEORDI / I didn't come here to give you weapons.
 WORF / Commander, a photon torpedo may penetrate their shield.
 RIKER / Any hostile move on our part would only jeopardize Geordi.
 WORF / But what do the Pakleds want?
 RIKER / Counselor?
 TROI / They have what they want... for now.
 PICARD / Did you read that book I gave you?
 WESLEY / Some of it.
 PICARD / That's reassuring.
 WESLEY / I just don't have much time.
 PICARD / (re the book in his hand) There is no greater challenge than the study of philosophy.
 WESLEY / William James sure won't be on my Starfleet exams.
 PICARD / The important things never will be. Anyone can be trained to deal with technology, and the mechanics of piloting a starship.
 WESLEY / But Starfleet Academy--
 PICARD / It takes more than just that. Open your mind to the past... to history, art, philosophy. And then... (re: the stars) ... this will mean something.
 PICARD / (continuing) Just consider James' wisdom: "Philosophy... is not a technical matter... it is our sense of what life honestly means... our individual way of feeling the total push and pressure of the cosmos." (then) That's what I want for you.
 TROI / It is all deception. Lies.
 RIKER / Everything? What about the distress call?
 TROI / Nothing the Pakleds have said or done has been sincere.
 DATA / Intensified scan shows their guidance system is perfectly intact, as is their power generator.
 RIKER / Then what was Geordi repairing?
 DATA / Apparently, the putative malfunctions were carefully programmed into their ship's computer.
 RIKER / I didn't think the Pakleds had that kind of technology.
 DATA / They seem to have made some technological leaps forward, Commander.
 RIKER / But why would they go through the charade of needing our help?
 TROI / For the sole purpose of making Lieutenant La Forge their prisoner.
 RIKER / Options?
 WORF / Tactically speaking, we have three choices: we can negotiate, attack, or simply abandon Lieutenant La Forge.
 PICARD / You don't want to be late for your exams, Ensign.
 WESLEY / I've still got some time, sir.
 PICARD / Why do I get the feeling you're acting like some kind of escort?
 WESLEY / Doctor Pulaski asked me to make sure you actually went inside.
 PICARD / That woman. She would.
 WESLEY / Sir?
 PICARD / What is it?
 WESLEY / I enjoyed our trip together.
 PICARD / So did I.
 DATA / They are initiating visual contact--
 RIKER / Maybe we'll find out what the hell they really want.
 RIKER / We demand the immediate return of our crewmember.
 RIKER / Lower your shield!
 RIKER / Stop it! What do you want?
 RIKER / For defense against attack.
 RIKER / Our strength contributes to peace in this region of the galaxy. We mean no one harm.
 RIKER / I think you need to continue to develop --
 RIKER / Prove it. Return our man to us.
 RIKER / Yes, dammit!
 RIKER / We've got a man held hostage by alien forces and all I have are non-option options! I'd like some input...
 WORF / (bristling) They've already hit him with multiple phaser stuns.
 WORF / Security team stands ready to take the initiative, sir.
 RIKER / Data?
 DATA / Our options have not changed. We can either respond to the Pakled demand or not. We can either use force or not.
 RIKER / I've already answered their demand. Allowing access to the Enterprise computers by alien forces would be a complete breech of Starfleet security.
 WORF / Then force it must be.
 Picard lies on an operating table, surrounded by twenty-fourth century surgical equipment as NURSES prepare him for his procedure. Off to one side, a MEDICAL TEAM preps the replacement heart. The SURGEON steps up to PICARD, reassures him: / 
 PICARD / Get on with it, Doctor. I've got work to do.
 DATA / There is very little information available on Pakled culture, but the eclectic range of their equipment would suggest that everything they have has been stolen from others.
 TROI / And now they have become militant.
 DATA / So it would seem.
 RIKER / Rationale?
 TROI / They are unwilling to wait for the timely evolution of their species' intellectual capacity. They seek instant knowledge, instant power and gratification.
 TROI / Yes. Infantile humans are known for responses of a similar nature.
 RIKER / Then suppose we treat them like children.
 DATA / Sir?
 RIKER / It's time we set some limits.
 DATA / To what effect, sir? We are faced with an impossible conundrum.
 RIKER / Not if we let Geordi give them something they want... and then create the right moment for him to take it away.
 TROI / Would you be suggesting a ruse of some sort?
 RIKER / I would.
 RIKER / We don't have any choice. We have to try.
 GEORDI / Let me talk to them. I'll get you their computer banks.
 GEORDI / So open the hailing frequency. They'll listen to me.
 GEORDI / Commander Riker?
 RIKER / Yes, Lieutenant. We're here.
 GEORDI / The Pakleds seem pretty sincere.
 RIKER / Our computer banks are non-negotiable.
 GEORDI / Excuse me, Commander, but let's consider that for a minute. The Enterprise's protected memory storage is so extensive that it would take well over twenty-four hours just to access. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / In that time, maybe we could all reach a more acceptable resolution to our little misunderstanding here.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Belive me, they're nothing if not persistent.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Nobody ever said they were great conversationalists.
 RIKER / Where did they get their shields?
 GEORDI / From what I've seen, half the systems on this ship have been stolen from Romulans, Jarada, Klingons, just about anybody they ever came in contact with.
 RIKER / Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge. They steal technology.
 DATA / But they lack the ability to use it properly.
 RIKER / (back to Geordi) You're an excellent chief engineer, Lieutenant.
 GEORDI / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / And of course, your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry is unmatched.
 GEORDI / That's kind of you to say, sir, but Lieutenant Worf --
 RIKER / (cutting him off) Our missions are always inherently dangerous. Any of us could be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time.
 GEORDI / Uh... yes, sir, but --
 RIKER / Speaking of time, Lieutenant, this may be your time. I shall personally miss you.
 DATA / You will always be in my memory.
 GEORDI / Data... wait a minute. Can't we.. ?
 DATA / I shall miss you at weapons systems analysis.
 GEORDI / Weapons system analysis? (then, tentative, trying it out) I guess you'll just have to carry out the photon torpedo countdowns without me.
 DATA / Exactly. Fond farewell.
 GEORDI / (with "humility") It's not something I like to talk about --
 WORF / Lieutenant La Forge.
 GEORDI / Worf... my old friend.
 WORF / Any classified weapons knowledge you share with your captors will be considered treason.
 GEORDI / (re the Pakleds) I may have no choice.
 WORF / You will die without honor.
 GEORDI / I know. Just my luck.
 WORF / You will never attain the twenty-four levels of awareness.
 GEORDI / Twenty-four? That's quite a challenge.
 WORF / Indeed. Twenty-four is the gateway to heroic salvation.
 RIKER / He'd better.
 TROI / He is afraid.
 RIKER / We all are, Counselor.
 GEORDI / Not smart enough. I'm still here.
 GEORDI / I thought you wanted me to help you... "go". Why don't we work on that guidance system, okay?
 GEORDI / You've gotta be kidding.
 GEORDI / (re: the armaments) There isn't enough juice in these to blow off a passing asteroid.
 GEORDI / I suppose we could increase the anti-matter charges.
 RIKER / True. But if anyone can improvise, it's Geordi.
 DATA / Ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential. (then, to Riker) The timing will be crucial. He must correctly interpret our intentions.
 RIKER / Geordi's up to speed. I trust his instincts.
 DATA / The Pakleds did hear our little fiction about Geordi's "weapons knowledge."
 RIKER / Exactly. And since they obviously equate intelligence with strength, they won't pass up this chance to use that knowledge. (then, to Sonya) Can you do it?
 WORF (V.O.) / Bridge to Commander Riker!
 RIKER / Go ahead, bridge --
 WORF (V.O.) / I am receiving an emergency summons from Starbase five one five... Captain Picard is close to death!
 RIKER / (to Sonya) Be ready!
 GEORDI / You're now armed to the teeth.
 GEORDI / (with a patient sigh) You have photon torpedoes. You are strong.
 DATA / Positive indication of armed photon torpedoes, Commander.
 RIKER / Geordi did it.
 WORF / Starbase requests we proceed to base at warp nine --
 TROI / Yes. Captain Picard needs our help.
 RIKER / We can't leave Geordi behind -- (then, to Data) I want the Pakleds on that screen and I want them now!
 DATA / Forced spectrum communications are spotty at best, sir.
 RIKER / Do it.
 RIKER / This is the Enterprise. Return our personnel or face immediate reprisal.
 RIKER / Are you prepared to use them?
 TROI / They feel confident.
 RIKER / We don't have time for this. You want power? This is power... (to computer) Bridge to Ensign Gomez...
 RIKER (V.O.) / Initiate sequencing.
 RIKER / Begin firing sequence countdown from twenty-four.
 GEORDI / They mean business. Let me just check something.
 WORF / Firing sequence proceeding, sir.
 RIKER / Hold fast.
 GEORDI / Just another second here...
 RIKER / Fire!
 GEORDI / Now!
 GEORDI / Oh no! Too late!
 GEORDI / But they used the crimson force-field --
 GEORDI / Their crimson force-field disarmed us.
 RIKER / Drop your shields and let us transport Lieutenant La Forge immediately.
 DATA / Shields are down.
 RIKER / Transporter Room. One to beam to the bridge.
 RIKER / Set heading for Starbase five one five. Warp nine.
 RIKER / We leave you in peace.
 RIKER / Weapons alone do not create strength. You must learn restraint.
 RIKER / Off.
 GEORDI / What was that red blast?
 RIKER / Hydrogen exhaust through the Bussard collectors. Harmless, but a nice light show.
 GEORDI / Very impressive.
 RIKER / Did you disable their photons?
 GEORDI / Just in time. That's why you're all standing here...
 PICARD / What in the hell are you doing here?
 PICARD / Oh come on. This is a routine procedure. Quite commonplace.
 PICARD / I didn't want you involved in this.
 PICARD / If you're here... the entire crew must know...
 PICARD / Thank you.
 PICARD / I beg your pardon.
 GEORDI / Looks like things are back to normal...
 PICARD / I'm pleased to report that Ensign Crusher's Starfleet exam results will enable him to continue with his studies on board the Enterprise. Furthermore, any rumors of my brush with death are greatly exaggerated. Is that clear?
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Good. Set the course for Epsilon Sector. (to Wesley) Warp five, Ensign.
 PICARD / (continuing) Engage.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42823.2. My meeting with Admiral James Moore has offered me an interesting proposal. We have completed our repairs, and are preparing to warp out.
 PICARD is listening to the raspy, static filled TONES / of an SOS code. RIKER enters.
 RIKER / Yes, sir?
 PICARD / Recognize that?
 RIKER / No, sir, I'm sorry, I don't.
 PICARD / It's an old style Terran distress beacon. It kicked in last month, and was detected by the starbase.
 RIKER / What's its origin point?
 PICARD / The Ficus quadrant.
 RIKER / (thinks for a moment) Captain, there are no records of an Earth colony in that area.
 PICARD / Admiral Moore has offered us the task of investigating the signal.
 RIKER / (with a grin) And of course we've accepted.
 PICARD / Am I so transparent?
 RIKER / You've got that look in your eye.
 PICARD / (a little uncomfortable) Oh?
 RIKER / The lure of a mystery.
 PICARD / A lost Earth colony. That is an exciting idea.
 RIKER / They may not have survived.
 PICARD / They're calling for help, aren't they?
 RIKER / You're an optimist.
 PICARD / Always.
 RIKER / The European Hegemony?
 PICARD / A loose alliance that formed in the early twenty-second century. It was the first step toward a world government. You should read more history, Number One. Computer, bracket exact dates when this beacon was in general use.
 RIKER / No extraterrestrial source has ever used this beacon?
 PICARD / Locate all Earth deep space launches from 2123 until 2190, and list their destinations.
 PICARD / Nothing for the Ficus quadrant. Damn it, who's out there?
 RIKER / Guess we'll have to wait and ask them.
 RIKER / How could a spaceship leave Earth without some kind of a record?
 DATA / Perhaps it was deliberate. They may have wished to escape detection.
 RIKER / You're suggesting they were fugitives?
 DATA / During the Eugenics Wars a group of genetically superior humans ruled the world. After their defeat some did escape.
 RIKER / What do you think, Worf. Can we handle supermen?
 RIKER / Medical emergency! Doctor Pulaski to the bridge.
 WORF / I am fine.
 WORF / I did not faint. Klingons do not faint.
 WORF / Doctor, there is no need to insult me.
 WORF / Klingons don't get sick.
 WORF / Doctor, no one must learn that I am suffering from a childhood ailment!
 WORF / But it is so humiliating!
 PICARD / Ah, Doctor, how is Worf?
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / Sir, there is a discrepancy between our requisition order for display panels and the number actually tendered by the starbase.
 PICARD / How can something so simple become so complicated?
 DATA / Such is the nature of a bureaucracy?
 PICARD / (to himself and cutting off Data) There's more than one way to skin a bureaucratic cat.
 DATA / Sir?
 PICARD / There's no record of a launch to the Ficus quadrant. Not unusual if you consider the chaos of the early twenty-second century, but someone had to load that ship.
 DATA / Ah, yes, the manifest.
 PICARD / There it is. The Mariposa, launch date November 27, 2123. Captain Walter Granger, commanding.
 DATA / Mariposa is the Spanish word for butterfly.
 PICARD / Thank you, Data.
 DATA / I thought it might be significant.
 PICARD / It doesn't appear to be. Ah... and here is the cargo list. (in an aside to Data) You can tell a lot about people from their luggage. Let's see, two hundred and twenty five Yoshimitsu computers, five monitor beacon satellites, seven hundred cellular commlinks, fifty spinning wheels --
 DATA / Spinning wheels? Accessing. A device for spinning yarn or thread that consists of a large foot or hand driven wheel and one spindle.
 PICARD / Cattle, chickens, pigs. . . . not DNA, the actual livestock. (to Data) Incredible. Why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo?
 DATA / Spindle -- a thin rounded tapering rod --
 PICARD / (exasperated) Data!
 DATA / Perhaps they were planning for the worst. (Data goes into analysis mode) In the early twenty-second century Earth was recovering from World War III. A major philosopher of the period was Liam Dieghan, the founder of the Neo-Transcendentalists. He advocated a return to a simpler life in which one lived in harmony with nature, and learned under her gentle tutelage --
 PICARD / Thank you, Data. But if this was a ship full of utopians, why carry the technological baggage?
 DATA / Sir, I have insufficient information from which to form a cogent theory.
 PICARD / I hate a mystery.
 DATA / (confused) But, sir what about Dixon Hill, and your penchant for detective fiction --
 PICARD / (interrupting) Allow me to correct myself. I hate a mystery I cannot solve.
 WORF / I wished to thank you for protecting my --
 WORF / You know the ceremony?
 WORF / You must not drink the tea. It is deadly to humans.
 WORF / It is a test of bravery, of one's ability to look at the face of mortality. It is also a reminder that death is an experience best shared -- like the tea.
 WORF / It is among the Klingons that love poetry achieves its fullest flower.
 DATA / Scans indicate human life form readings thirty meters below the planet's surface.
 WORF / Hailing on all frequencies, Captain. So far no response.
 DATA / There is no evidence of an advanced communication network.
 PICARD / But the comlinks?
 WORF / There is no artifical power source on the planet.
 RIKER / But they've got a monitoring satellite.
 TROI / A good thing, too. Without it we would never have known they needed help.
 DATA / Captain, the stellar flares are increasing in intensity and frequency. Computer projections indicate they will envelope the planet in three point six hours.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, prepare for immediate evacuation.
 WORF / Evacuation will be difficult. Our shields can be lowered for transport only between the flares.
 TROI / Captain, these people have been isolated for three hundred years. We cannot beam them to the Enterprise without warning.
 RIKER / And if they have slipped back into barbarism the experience would scare them to death.
 PICARD / You'll have to go down there, Number One.
 RIKER / On my way.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Riker has reached the caverns, but we are still waiting to begin the evacuation.
 PICARD / What's the situation, Number One?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / There are roughly two hundred people down here.
 PICARD / Their condition?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Surprisingly good.
 PICARD / Are they willing to leave?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, but --
 PICARD / (interrupting) Well, get them up here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I'm having a little altercation with the colony's leader.
 PICARD / I'm not interested, Commander. Initiate the transport.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / But, sir --
 PICARD / No arguments.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way. All of us. Riker out.
 PICARD / What the devil is going on here?!
 PICARD / My security chief, Lieutenant Worf.
 PICARD / I don't want your service, Mister Odell. I want this damn livestock off my ship.
 RIKER / (sotto voce to Picard) You said you didn't want to waste time arguing.
 RIKER / And can this man ever argue.
 PICARD / Alright. Chief O'Brien, kindly transport this group to Cargo Hold Seven, and the remaining refugees on the planet should go directly into the hold so we can stop dirtying my ship.
 RIKER / We're taking another little ride.
 PICARD / Er... fine, and then Mister Worf can show you the ship.
 PICARD / (very dry) My pleasure.
 PICARD / I don't own the Enterprise, I command her.
 PICARD / No. Why?
 PICARD / (very dry) I felicitate you.
 PICARD / (explosively) No!
 PICARD / Yes!
 PICARD / (to Pulaski) What is the colonists' overall condition?
 PICARD / (to Worf) What's the total?
 WORF / Two hundred and twenty-three.
 PICARD / Next question, what to do with them? Take them to a starbase? They were anachronistic in 2123. How will they cope?
 RIKER / There's no question they could learn and adapt, but it would be dislocating, and the colony would probably be splintered. Maybe we should be looking for a new home for them?
 WORF / Lieutenant Worf, report!
 RIKER / The Bringloidi!
 PICARD / (to Riker) I wonder what they've done to my ship now.
 PICARD / Unseal the doors.
 WORF / Automated fire system. A force field contains the flames until the available oxygen within the field has been consumed.
 WORF / You would have been standing in the fire.
 WORF / You would have suffocated and died.
 PICARD / My apologies, ma'am, I was unaware that you had not been instructed in the use of the food dispensers.
 RIKER / (smiling) I thought I had.
 RIKER / Very pleased to meet you, ma'am.
 RIKER / What about the men?
 RIKER / Of all the reactions that's not the one I expected.
 PICARD / Number One, there are times in life when you have to simply bow to the absurd.
 PICARD / (clearing his throat) The... ah... ship's computers sense a localized increase in --
 RIKER / I think I'll go give her some help, Captain.
 RIKER / That wasn't necessary. The ship will clean itself.
 RIKER / I think it's the responsibility of the ship's first officer to show that girl all the amenities.
 WORF / She is very like a Klingon woman, Captain.
 PICARD / My condolences, Mister Worf.
 PICARD / The point, Mister Odell?
 PICARD / Other colony?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. A review of stellar charts has revealed a Class M planet, NB2323 only half a light year from the Bringloid system. I am gambling it was the destination of the second colony.
 RIKER / I'll leave you ladies to your discussions. Dinner, Brenna? I'll cook.
 RIKER / You don't have to do that.
 RIKER / I can see why your father wants to marry you off.
 RIKER / (imitating the patois) So he can have a pipe, and mug of beer in peace.
 RIKER / What's that?
 RIKER / Through there. Glass of wine while I cook?
 RIKER / What do you mean?
 RIKER / Of course I like... Oh... is there a technique to this foot washing?
 RIKER / I think I can handle that.
 RIKER / Feeling better, Worf?
 WORF / Yes. And you, Commander?
 RIKER / Couldn't be better.
 RIKER / (continuing) Status, Mister Data?
 DATA / Warp factor five, continuing on course for NB2323. E.t.a. eighteen hours.
 RIKER / Excellent.
 WORF / You sent for me?
 WORF / You can obtain spiritous liquors from the food dispensers.
 WORF / No, if you wish it can be real alcohol.
 WORF / (warningly) With all of the deleterious effects intact.
 WORF / (to the unit) Chech'tluth.
 WORF / What!
 WORF / Madam, have you considered a career in security?
 WORF / Signal from the planet, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / (continuing) This is Jean-Luc Picard of the United Federation vessel USS Enterprise.
 DATA / No doubt a descendant of Captain Walter Granger.
 PICARD / I'm afraid you were lost in the bureaucracy, but despite the lateness of our arrival we are here now, and eager to renew ties.
 PICARD / Number One, form an away team.
 TROI / I would urge caution. Mister Granger is hiding something.
 RIKER / We'll check it out. Mister Worf. (he looks up) Doctor Pulaski join me in Transporter Room Three for an away detail.
 RIKER / William Riker, Doctor Pulaski, Lieutenant Worf.
 RIKER / (sotto voce) A brother?
 RIKER / Worf, stand by for immediate beam out. There's something damn odd down here.
 WORF / Aye, Commander.
 RIKER / Clones?
 WORF / Clones?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Prime Minister Granger has requested an urgent meeting to discuss the future of the Mariposan colony.
 PICARD / So they used that expertise and turned to cloning.
 PICARD / A culture with no children.
 RIKER / Wait. I don't understand. Replecative fading?
 PICARD / How can we help?
 RIKER / You want to clone us?
 RIKER / No way. Not me.
 RIKER / It's not a question of harm. A single William Riker is unique, maybe even special. Hundreds or thousands of them diminish me in a way I can't explain.
 RIKER / Human beings have another way of doing that. We have children.
 PICARD / I think you will find this to be the attitude of a predominate number of Enterprise people.
 PICARD / Yes, of course. Number One, form away teams, and get the repairs underway.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / You sent for us?
 GEORDI / Excuse me, sir, I was looking for Commander Riker.
 GEORDI / Doctor Pulaski?
 GEORDI / Guess I'll just have to hunt for them. Sorry to disturb you.
 PICARD / I finally understand. That distress satellite was left by the Mariposans as a way to protect the Bringloidi. There were two colonies on that ship.
 WORF / Interesting, Captain.
 PICARD / And not terribly relevant, I know. Still, it gives one pause for thought....
 GEORDI / What happened on Mariposa? Are you all right?
 RIKER / Is there some reason why we shouldn't be?
 GEORDI / Yeah, every time I asked where you were, some clone lied to me.
 RIKER / (very grim) Lied to you?
 GEORDI / (removes his VISOR) Commander, with this I can see a lot more than your average person. When people lie there are certain physical manifestations; variations in blush response, pupil dilation, pulse and breath rate. I can't use the VISOR on aliens, but humans -- I've got them nailed.
 GEORDI / Yes.
 GEORDI / Granger said he hadn't seen either of you. Did you get to his office?
 RIKER / I don't remember.
 GEORDI / So what's the prognosis, Doc? Will I ever play the piano again?
 GEORDI / Great.
 RIKER / (grimly) Meaning?
 GEORDI / Where are you going?
 RIKER / To that cloning lab.
 GEORDI / I don't suppose you'd believe this was an accident?
 RIKER / Like hell! You're a damn thief!
 RIKER / So that gives you the right to assault us, and rob us, and --
 PICARD / Doctor, how desperate is the colony's situation?
 RIKER / I want that cloning equipment inspected. Who knows how many tissue samples they've stolen. I have the right to exercise control over my own body.
 TROI / I know the Mariposan culture seems alien, even frightening, but we really do have much in common. They're human beings fighting to survive. Would we do any less?
 PICARD / Are you saying we should give them the DNA samples they require?
 PICARD / The Bringloidi.
 TROI / (excited, seeing the possibilities) The Bringloidi have energy and drive, a sense of wonder. The clones possess emotional maturity, and technological know-how.
 PICARD / They started out together. It does seem only fitting that they end up together.
 RIKER / Unfortunately it's going to be a shotgun wedding.
 PICARD / Can't you understand? The Bringloidi can help you.
 PICARD / Sit down! I am not going to allow brag... (a look to Danilo) ... and bigotry... (a look to Granger) ... to destroy this meeting.
 PICARD / (to Granger) Commander Riker wants your laboratories inspected for any stolen tissue. I can understnad his concern, and I think we're going to have to transport all of your equipment to the Enterprise.
 PICARD / (angry) All right, die!
 PICARD / (gentler now) The end is closer than you'd like to think.
 PICARD / Yes. But it's differences which have made us strong.
 PICARD / Frightening?
 PICARD / (sotto voce) I must be out of my mind.
 PICARD / Miss Odell, I am --
 PICARD / Miss Odell, you're the one who wanted a new home.
 PICARD / That is your choice. If you wish to stay aboard the Enterprise we will drop you at a starbase, and you can go where you will.
 PICARD / Brenna, you've always been the mothering force for your people. If this is going to work they'll need your wisdom and guidance.
 PICARD / We have to make choices.
 PICARD / He's the prime minister.
 PICARD / It is.
 PICARD / All squared away?
 RIKER / The Bringloidi have reached their new home.
 DATA / It is unfortunate that we cannot remain for several months, and observe the integration of the two colonies.
 PICARD / We've done what we could. We've put the cats in the same sack, and given it a good shake.
 DATA / But what is occurring on Mariposa is a demonstration of sociobiology, and the concept of the selfish gene. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / Males and females are each pursuing their respective reproductive strategies in an effort to maximize their contribution to the gene pool of the next generation.
 RIKER / Data, I liked the captain's analogy better.
 DATA / Why?
 DATA / How are cats in a sack romantic? They would fight and scratch and...
 WORF / Very romantic. I hunt in darkness. The stars my guide. The memory of you sings in my blood. I seize the gift.
 WORF / (continuing) Carry it to your bower. And lay at your feet the hearts of my enemies.
 PICARD / Engage.
 WORF / (sotto voce) Perhaps it does not translate well.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42881.5. We are in orbit around Antede Three, awaiting the arrival of two dignitaries from this world.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Our mission is to carry them to a conference on planet Pacifica...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... where their race will be given the opportunity to join the Federation.
 PICARD / I thought you might find this interesting, Mister Crusher. Few humans have ever seen an Antedian in the flesh.
 PICARD / Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Enterprise.
 WESLEY / (hesitates, then) Are they alright, Captain?
 PICARD / No, this is their preferred way of space travel.
 PICARD / (to Welsey) It is a self-induced catatonic state. Their way of dealing with the trauma of spaceflight.
 WESLEY / Will we try to revive them?
 PICARD / Not until we reach the Pacifica conference. It's three days away. (to Pulaski) You've prepared Sickbay facilities for holding them, Doctor?
 WESLEY / What's in this container?
 WESLEY / This is what they eat?
 PICARD / (to Worf) Provide security.
 WORF / Understood, sir.
 WORF / (continuing) What a handsome race.
 RIKER / What did you think of the Antedians, Wesley?
 WESLEY / Well, they are rather strange-looking, Commander.
 DATA / Judging a being by its physical appearance is the last great human prejudice, Wesley.
 PICARD / A point well taken. I'm sure that to the Antedians, we're equally unattractive.
 RIKER / It is interesting to consider just how subjective "beauty" truly is...
 WORF / Captain... we're being hailed by a small transport vessel just coming into range.
 TROI / Oh, my God!
 PICARD / What is the problem?
 TROI / What can she be doing here?
 WESLEY / On the screen, Captain.
 RIKER / We have you on our viewer, Pilot.
 MRS. TROI (V.O.) / Let me talk to them, Pilot. I'm much more articulate.
 TROI / Mother!
 DATA / Captain, we are now receiving Starfleet orders granting a Lwaxana....
 MRS. TROI / (overlapping) Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Riix, heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed.
 DATA / ... full ambassadorial status, sir.
 RIKER / I'm afraid it's back into your formal uniform, Captain.
 DATA / And yours too, Commander. She is listed as representing the Betazed government at the conference.
 TROI / Mother, please don't do this to me.
 MRS. TROI / Do what to you, Little One? (to Picard) Oh, what naughty thoughts, Jean-Luc. How wonderful you still think of me in that way.
 TROI / It's so like my mother to do the unexpected. She's famous for it.
 PICARD / It will be nice to have her as a guest of the Enterprise again.
 PICARD / Energize.
 MRS. TROI / (opening her eyes) Aaagh! Where are my legs?!
 TROI / Where they belong, Mother, Right under you.
 MRS. TROI / (offhand) Oh, wonderful. So they are! (turning to Picard) But I'll never completely trust this device, Jean-Luc...
 TROI / He's "Captain Picard," Mother...
 MRS. TROI / Aaagh!
 PICARD / (to Riker, resignedly) Explain.
 RIKER / Sorry they startled you, Mrs. Troi. These are Antedian delegates... ah, temporarily being stored here, I believe...
 MRS. TROI / "Delegates?" The last time I saw something like this, it was being served on a plate.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) But you, Jean-Luc, I was not aware you had such handsome legs. My valet is waiting. You may beam him aboard now.
 MRS. TROI / You remember Mister Homn, of course.
 PICARD / It would be hard to forget Mister Homn. Welcome back to the Enterprise.
 MRS. TROI / I've retained his services despite the outlandishly lustful thoughts he spews in my direction. I suppose the poor fellow just can't help himself.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing; to Picard) Perhaps you could show me to my suite now?
 PICARD / Certainly.
 MRS. TROI / Put that down, Homn. We can't deny the captain the honor of carrying my belongings.
 PICARD / I won't interfere with Homn's duties this time.
 MRS. TROI / That's not the real reason, Jean-Luc. You forget I'm a telepath.
 RIKER / Look, since this apparently has some meaning to you, Mrs. Troi, I'll...
 RIKER / (continuing) ...carry...it.
 RIKER / (trying not to sound labored) It's... just down this hall.
 MRS. TROI / (telepathic) He has nice legs too, Little One. Is he still yours?
 TROI / (telepathic) Humans no longer own each other that way, Mother.
 MRS. TROI / Oh really? (looks at Picard) That's a custom we may have to introduce again.
 MRS. TROI / Thank you.
 RIKER / Glad I could help out.
 PICARD / I trust you'll be comfortable here, Mrs. Troi. Now if you'll excuse me, I must get back to my duties.
 MRS. TROI / Captain, I will be serving a Betazoid dinner of greeting tonight. It is an ambassadorial function.
 PICARD / (after a hesitation) Of course. It, uh, sounds delightful.
 MRS. TROI / He's a fine man. Solid. Earnest. Reliable. Perhaps a little on the dull side, but all in all he's not bad.
 TROI / I cannot believe you! You sound like you're sizing up a commodity.
 MRS. TROI / But that's exactly what men are, darling. Especially human men. (chuckles, strokes Deanna's face) Was your father ever unhappy with me?
 TROI / No, he worshipped you, Mother. But I'll never learn to see men the way you do.
 MRS. TROI / You will as you mature, darling. And the males in your life will bless you for it.
 WESLEY / ... but it's true she complimented Captain Picard on his legs?
 DATA / I would have thought a telepath would be more discreet.
 RIKER / No, it's just the opposite. She knows what's in your mind and she lets you know what's on hers.
 PICARD / We must not lose sight of the fact that we're talking about someone who has been granted ambassadorial rank. Even if she appears a bit eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be treated with appropriate respect. Is that understood?
 DATA / Our orders on her mentioned nothing specific except...
 PICARD / (waits) Except what, Mister Data?
 DATA / We are to cooperate with her as fully as possible, deliver her there untroubled, rested... (seeing Picard's expression) I assume those were merely courtesies due her rank, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) See that every bridge officer and supervisor has the full text of that transmission.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Picard to Pulaski. When was the last time you looked in on our Antedian guests?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Are they still catatonic?
 PICARD / Understood. Keep me informed -- Picard out.
 PICARD / I believe I'll get some rest. (exiting; to Riker) It will be a dress uniform dinner, gentlemen.
 RIKER / Sir?
 DATA / Inquiry, Commander: to which dinner was the captain referring?
 RIKER / Nothing I've been invited to. Have any of you?
 RIKER / (continuing) Very interesting!
 PICARD / You're not attending the dinner with us this evening, Doctor?
 MRS. TROI (V.O.) / (sing-song) Come in!
 PICARD / Tell me Mister Homn, when will the others be arriving?
 PICARD / (continuing) The other officers? (pause) Commander Riker? Deanna?
 MRS. TROI / (purring) Hello, Jean-Luc. So glad you could come.
 MRS. TROI / (raising glass) A toast: to Earthmen... who despite their faults, have a unique ability to charm women of all races, in all corners of the galaxy.
 PICARD / (clinks glass) Speaking for the men of Earth, which is an awesome responsibility indeed, I thank you.
 MRS. TROI / (teasing, flirting) I know what you're thinking, Captain.
 PICARD / (a bit worried) You do?
 MRS. TROI / You're wondering if I've been seeing any other man on a serious basis.
 PICARD / (shaking head) Well actually I wasn't --
 MRS. TROI / -- I wouldn't worry about it, Jean-Luc. (MORE)
 MRS. TROI (Cont'd) / (reaches out, touches his hand) Competition seems to bring out the best in the human male.
 PICARD / I must admit, I wasn't expecting this... setting. I assumed that my high-ranking officers would also be attending.
 MRS. TROI / Never assume anything when it comes to Lwaxana Troi. A Betazoid woman is full of surprises.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) Strange, I'm not that hungry tonight. (leans forward, coy) I wonder what's making me lose my appetite? Any ideas?
 PICARD / Oh yes, you're giving thanks for your food. I'd forgotten about that. (pause) I wonder how many other cultures have similar customs.
 MRS. TROI / I don't know.
 PICARD / Let's find out. (touches his communicator) Commander Data.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Mrs. Troi and I are having a very interesting discussion about the various ways by which societies give thanks. For instance, the Betazoids use of the chime.
 DATA / The use of the chime is unique, but not at all dissimilar to the Ooolans of Marejaretus Six, who use two large stones which are continuously struck during the meal. Those at the dinner must eat until the stones are broken. Or, the oligarchy on Atifs Four, which require a young male to...
 PICARD / (overlapping) Commander, this is absolutely fascinating, don't you agree, Mrs. Troi? Data, if your duties permit, why don't you join us for dessert?
 DATA / You are forgetting sir -- I do not digest foodstuffs, therefore I cannot participate in the consumption of your post-main course edibles.
 MRS. TROI / What'd he just say?
 PICARD / You don't have to eat to join us, Commander. I'm sure Mrs. Troi would simply enjoy the pleasure of your company.
 DATA / Indeed, sir. I am on my way; Data out.
 MRS. TROI / (annoyed) How could you possibly think I'd want to share our special time together, with that robot of yours?
 PICARD / Because... because of his wonderful after-dinner conversation. His anecdotes are the stuff of legends aboard this ship.
 DATA / -- So by using the square root of pi and then multiplying it by nine to the third power, I was able to accurately calculate the distance between the Omicron galaxy and the Crab Nebula.
 PICARD / Fascinating, Data. I'm sure Mrs. Troi would love to hear the one about the, uh, anomalous chemical composition of... say... brown dwarf stars.
 MRS. TROI / Well, not really --
 DATA / (enthused) -- Yes Captain, that is a particularly spellbinding subject.
 DATA / (continuing) For most stars, the rare-Earth element Europium is enriched relative to samarium and gadolinium...
 MRS. TROI / (flat, bored) Is that so?
 DATA / It is! However in brown dwarf stars, the element Europium is anomalously depleted.
 MRS. TROI / (sarcastic) Fascinating.
 DATA / But that is only the beginning. If the abundances of the elements terbium, dysprosium, holmium and erbium are also factored into the analysis...
 TROI / Doctor, perhaps I should tell you something about my mother's condition at this time.
 TROI / Something that occurs to Betazoid females at mid-life. We call it the Phase.
 TROI / (laughing) Almost the exact opposite. It is only at mid-life that Betazed females become... well, fully sexual, if you know what I mean.
 TROI / I wonder if I shouldn't warn the captain?
 TROI / (somewhat shocked) Doctor... !
 TROI / Yes. An animal is always at its best when hunted...
 DATA / ... and at this point, the second co-orbital satellite avoids a collision with the first.
 TROI / I hope I'm not interrupting.
 PICARD / (rising) No, as a matter of fact, I need to get back to the bridge myself.
 DATA / Perhaps I should stay here and further entertain our guest.
 MRS. TROI / -- No! I mean, I think you're needed on the bridge as well.
 PICARD / (a bit stiff) Thank you for a delicious meal. Let's uh, do it again sometime.
 MRS. TROI / (purring) Oh, I know we will.
 MRS. TROI / Little One, the captain is every bit as charming as your father was.
 PICARD / (exhaling) Data, you'll never know just how much I owe you for that.
 DATA / Indeed, Captain? I know many more interesting anecdotes as well.
 RIKER / Status of the Antedian delegates unchanged, Captain.
 PICARD / What's our e.t.a. to the conference?
 RIKER / Forty five point three hours, sir.
 PICARD / Very good, Number One. I'll be in my Ready Room.
 TROI / Why would you come aboard at a time like this?
 MRS. TROI / (shrugging) I had no choice. I was going to Pacifica, you were going to Pacifica, it seemed the appropriate thing to do.
 TROI / Don't be absurd -- you knew what this would lead to...
 TROI / What stage is it in?
 MRS. TROI / I have it completely under control.
 TROI / (demanding) What stage is it in?
 MRS. TROI / (smiles) Well, far enough along for me to enjoy it, Little One.
 TROI / (worried) Now I know why you wore that dress.
 MRS. TROI / (laughing) Don't be ridiculous. It's just a simple little dress -- there's nothing provocative about it.
 TROI / (more to herself) What are we going to do?
 MRS. TROI / I'm going to do the only honorable thing there is to do. (smiles) And I'd say the captain has the inside track.
 TROI / Don't even think it!
 MRS. TROI / Why not? He was thinking about it all through dinner.
 PICARD / I was what?!
 PICARD / (continuing) I tell you Deanna, for a telepath, your mother's accuracy leaves much to be desired.
 TROI / Actually, her telepathic prowess is quite advanced. Except for now.
 RIKER / "Except for now?"
 PICARD / Don't misunderstand me, Counselor. Your mother is a beautiful person...
 TROI / (continuing) My mother is just beginning a physiological phase... one that all Betazoid women must deal with as they enter mid-life.
 RIKER / It's something Troi warned me about when we were first seeing each other. (looks at Troi) When a Betazoid female goes through "the Phase," it quadruples her sex drive.
 TROI / Or more...
 RIKER / (to Troi) ... "or more?" I didn't know that.
 TROI / I didn't want to frighten you. (to Picard) My mother has opted for the only dignified course of action open to her.
 RIKER / Isolation?
 TROI / She has chosen to focus all of her sexual energy on one male. This man will eventually become her husband, of course. (with difficulty) It seems Captain, that you are the early favorite.
 RIKER / Congratulations, sir!
 PICARD / I am not amused, Number One. (starts pacing again) There must be a way to convince her that it's quite impossible -- without offending her.
 TROI / You cannot apply human style logic to this, Captain. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / Mother would be shocked and deeply resentful, should you spurn her advances. She would naturally take it very personally.
 PICARD / Well, considering Starfleet's orders not to get her upset, I think it might be prudent for me to make myself less available for the duration of this journey.
 RIKER / Agreed.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Setting: San Francisco California, United States Of America, the year 1945 A.D., program to fit the novel, "The Long Dark Tunnel".
 PICARD (V.O.) / Dixon Hill's memoirs: date, the 1940's...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) It was a grey day in the city by the bay. My pockets were as empty as a press agent's heart. I needed a case, that's for sure, but the private dick racket was as slow as the horse I just blew my last two bucks on.
 PICARD / (pleased) Hello, it's good to see you again.
 PICARD / New cases?
 PICARD / (thoughtful) I see... Well, pay the tailor and stall the landlord.
 MRS. TROI / Unavailable? Ship's business?
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) Ship's business takes precedence over me?
 TROI / I'm afraid so.
 MRS. TROI / Hmmm... Oh well, he was too old for me anyway.
 MRS. TROI / (to Homn) Homn, let's consider my alternate plan.
 TROI / Alternate plan?
 MRS. TROI / You worry too much, Little One. Your mother has the situation well in hand.
 PICARD / Thank you, Madeline.
 PICARD / Yes, as the book said, everything about you is big: big shoulders... big neck... big fists...
 PICARD / Says so on my door, doesn't it?
 PICARD / Let me guess -- you want dance lessons.
 PICARD / Yes... yes, I understand that. No funny things.
 PICARD / Alva? Let's see -- I'll bet she's your sister...
 PICARD / Take it easy, Mac! I can't take the job of finding Alva if you break me like a matchstick.
 PICARD / (continuing; straightening tie) As a matter of fact, I knew who Alva was all along. I've read the book.
 PICARD / (to Slade) You got a picture?
 PICARD / Of course of Alva! The novel wasn't illustrated.
 PICARD / I believe the 1940 expression was "hubbah, hubbah, hubbah."
 PICARD / That's part of the cost of hiring a private eye like me, Slade. I'm very different from most you could get.
 PICARD / (nods) Okay. I'll find Alva for you; but you might not like what I find.
 PICARD (CONT'D) / This is so much fun.
 WORF / Even in this state, they possess a certain dignity, a graceful countenance.
 WESLEY / If you say so, Lieutenant.
 WORF / (peers at him) I see. Is this how you felt when you first saw me?
 WESLEY / (pause, guiltily) Well... maybe at first. (brightening) But now that I've seen a few more Klingons, I know that you're real handsome, for... for a Klingon.
 WESLEY / That uh, didn't come out quite right.
 MRS. TROI / I still say they'd look better in sauce. (moves closer; concentrating) No, nothing. (to Welsey) When will the good captain revive them?
 WESLEY / Not until we reach Pacifica, ma'am.
 MRS. TROI / You seem a fine boy. One day you will grow up to be a big, strong man.
 MRS. TROI / (continuing) But even though humans age far more rapidly than Betazoids, I cannot afford to wait for you to mature.
 MRS. TROI / (smiling) But you... your innermost thoughts are primal, savage. I like that in a man.
 WORF / I am not a man.
 MRS. TROI / Which is in your favor, men so often being irrational and egotistical. (eyes him, then sighs) But I'm afraid I've grown accustomed to human companionship. It's nothing personal, you would have made a fine choice.
 MRS. TROI / Who's next, Mister Homn?
 MRS. TROI / Ah yes. Let's get to it, I'm not getting any younger.
 WESLEY / What was that all about?
 MRS. TROI / Lieutenant La Forge, I wish to be direct with you.
 GEORDI / (turning to see her) I prefer it that way. Now what are you being direct about?
 MRS. TROI / I have decided to give all the bridge officers an equal opportunity to gain my favor.
 GEORDI / I see.
 MRS. TROI / Ah, but you don't, and that's the problem. I wonder whether a sightless man could ever appreciate great beauty.
 GEORDI / That's funny... I've always had the same doubts about the sighted.
 MRS. TROI / Odd. How so?
 GEORDI / Because my eyes don't seduce my mind, I'm driven to find beauty in other things -- things sighted people tend to ignore. The lovely temperature gradiations of bodies, the moisture patterns, the indications of inner peace and harmony...
 MRS. TROI / (thoughtful) Very interesting, Lieutenant. But I'm not sure if that's good or bad. A less perceptive man could be easier to live with.
 PICARD / Twenty dollars a day, plus expenses. Fifty when I find her.
 PICARD / You know it's wonderful to need money.
 PICARD / Let's see... I must have been skimming pages about here. What part did you play?
 PICARD / Ah, yes, of course.
 PICARD / My, my, time does fly in the Holodeck.
 PICARD / (continuing) Even if I happen to know a Slade Bender, why should I help you?
 PICARD / I knew you'd say something like that. Marvelous.
 PICARD / I don't think so.
 PICARD / No, the gun misfired. Thankfully the Holodeck is handling it correctly and the mortality failsafe is functional.
 PICARD / (continuing) But in some ways, the program is almost too accurate.
 PICARD / Don't worry about it. (shrugs) I'm going out for a drink.
 PICARD / You must be Rex. Am I right?
 PICARD / (sitting at bar) You're right, I do need a drink.
 PICARD / (smiling, nodding) Let's see... Scotch, neat?
 PICARD / (macho) So? I've got plenty more where that came from.
 PICARD / Uggh, I'm going to have to get used to that.
 PICARD / What the hell... make it four.
 PICARD / (pulls out a bill) Cash! I just took on a case.
 RIKER / Acknowledged, Doctor. (to Wesley) E.t.a. to Pacifica, Mister Crusher?
 WESLEY / (checking instruments) Twelve point four hours, sir. That will get us there approximately two hours before the conference begins.
 TROI / Mother, what are you doing here? You can't just stroll up to the bridge whenever you feel like it.
 MRS. TROI / (looking around) I didn't just stroll up, dear. I took the turbotube, or whatever you call it. (to Riker) The captain's not here?
 RIKER / He's busy elsewhere, ma'am.
 MRS. TROI / (beat; shrugs) Well, no matter. I have other interests as well.
 TROI / (telepathic) You're scheming something, Mother. I can tell.
 MRS. TROI / (telepathic) You're always so melodramatic, Little One. I'm not scheming, I'm deciding.
 MRS. TROI / Tell me Commander... what is your opinion of Betazoid women?
 RIKER / Well... I've only your daughter and you. But judging from that, I'd have to say they're the fairest in the galaxy.
 MRS. TROI / (telepathic) He has excellent taste, Little One.
 TROI / (telepathic) That's enough! This is getting embarrassing.
 MRS. TROI / (to Riker) My lovely daughter has always found it difficult to accept compliments from male admirers. I however, long ago learned to accept them.
 MRS. TROI (O.S.) / (continuing) The key is learning how to endure constant flattery without letting it go to your head. Don't you agree, Commander?
 RIKER / If you say so, ma'am.
 MRS. TROI / (to all on bridge) I like that answer! Now here's a man who knows how to defer to a lady. I only hope the rest of you men are listening.
 PICARD / It's hard to believe, Rex.
 PICARD / I recognize the size of the shadow. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (speaking, without turning around) Hello Slade. Buy you a drink?
 PICARD / I'm working on it.
 WORF / Is that good or bad?
 RIKER / Riker here.
 RIKER / How long before they're fully conscious?
 RIKER / Very good, Doctor, I'll notify the captain. Riker out. (to Mrs. Troi) If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
 MRS. TROI / Are you going to see the captain? I thought he was tied up on ship's business.
 RIKER / In a manner of speaking... he is. I'm uh, not going to interrupt him, I'm simply going to inform him.
 MRS. TROI / What excellent timing! You can also inform him about us.
 RIKER / Us?
 MRS. TROI / You don't mind if I let your bridge crew know first, do you William?
 MRS. TROI / (continuing, to everyone) Dear friends... you're all invited to a prestigious occasion on the planet Pacifica.
 TROI / (to herself) Oh no.
 MRS. TROI / (dabs her eyes) There, on the shores of the western sea... in a traditional Betazoid ceremony... your Commander Riker and I will be joined in the union of holy wedlock.
 WESLEY / Married?
 MRS. TROI / (smiling at Riker) 'Till death do us part.
 RIKER / Mrs. Troi... I don't know how to put this --
 MRS. TROI / -- I know just how you feel, dear. (moves to turbolift) Overwhelmed with excitement. Believe me, I understand.
 MRS. TROI / (continued) We'll talk about the details later. Right now, there are preparations to be made.
 TROI / Why did you stop me? Someone needs to set her straight!
 RIKER / I'd rather let the captain handle that.
 TROI / Coward!
 RIKER / Simply following Starfleet's orders. Keep her mind untroubled until the conference.
 DATA / Are you planing on going into the Holodeck, Commander?
 RIKER / Thought I might, Data. Want to come along?
 DATA / I have mastered the language, or "lingo" of the period, sir. Also, the mannerisms and body language.
 DATA / For example, this is a gesture denoting confidence and physical prowess. It is effective in attracting females and frightening off would-be adversaries.
 DATA / Should anything in there confuse you sir, do not hesitate to ask.
 RIKER / It's comforting to know I'm with an expert Data, but we're really not going to be there that long. (to computer) Computer...
 PICARD / She could be anywhere, Slade. You can't expect me to find her in one afternoon.
 PICARD / (surprised) Has it really? What I mean is -- you gotta have patience. I'll find her; I guarantee it.
 DATA / In the last program here, we said I was from South America. It seemed to explain my unorthodox appearance.
 PICARD / Easy Slade. They're friends of mine.
 RIKER / Sorry to bother you, Captain.
 PICARD / -- Call me Dixon.
 RIKER / -- Sorry to bother you, Dixon, but our two "passengers" are awakening.
 PICARD / Well then, it's time to go.
 PICARD / Sure, I can afford another round.
 DATA / Very accurate. Fascinating.
 PICARD / These are my associates... (indicates Riker) "Nails", from Chicago. (indicates Data) And --
 DATA / Carlos, from South America.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Troubles I've got, sir. There's a certain woman, a wealthy and beautiful woman, who suddenly says she's going to marry me.
 MRS. TROI / (to Homn) My fiance just has to see how I look in this. Come along, Homn.
 MRS. TROI / Tell me, computer, is Commander Riker still on the bridge?
 MRS. TROI / Holodeck? Where is that?
 MRS. TROI / (to Picard) I'm surprised you let this part of the ship get this dirty.
 PICARD / (indicating Riker) Actually, that's the first officer's job.
 RIKER / (nodding) Well, as a matter of fact...
 MRS. TROI / Relax, Commander. You have begun making your true feelings clear. Obviously you feel unable to handle me.
 MRS. TROI / I couldn't agree more.
 MRS. TROI / You are a most interesting person.
 MRS. TROI / This is the most remarkable man. I have never met anyone quite like him.
 PICARD / I don't suppose you have.
 MRS. TROI / He's strong. I feel no thoughts from him... nothing. I've never known a man so able to keep his true feelings completely hidden.
 PICARD / That's because...
 MRS. TROI / No man has ever been such a mystery to me. I usually know their thoughts before they do.
 MRS. TROI / No. And I never realized how erotic that could be. Carry my beverage to that table... we have some things to talk about.
 RIKER / Should we tell her?
 PICARD / I think it's only fair, but let's allow her the moment.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Doctor.
 PICARD / Understood.
 RIKER / I had better get to the bridge.
 PICARD / What's their condition?
 PICARD / Coming, Mrs. Troi?
 MRS. TROI / Not just yet. Tell William I'm sorry... but Rex and I are getting married.
 PICARD / Mrs. Troi, your government expects us to deliver you to the conference and I intend to do that!
 MRS. TROI / Duty calls, darling. I'll be back for you later.
 PICARD / There is something about Rex I think you had better know...
 MRS. TROI / Imagine -- allowing me to go on like that with a simple bartender who doesn't even exist!
 TROI / (amused) Mother, you always say you like new experiences.
 MRS. TROI / Why are they still here?
 RIKER / We thought that since you're going to the same conference, you might like to beam down with the other delegates.
 MRS. TROI / (casually) They're not delegates. Those two are assassins.
 MRS. TROI / Oh honey, don't bother to deny it. Your minds are so unsophisticated -- I can read your thoughts in my sleep. (to Picard, offhand) The inside of their robes are lined with ultritium. Highly explosive and virtually undetectable by your transporter.
 DATA / (surprised) She is correct, sir. I am detecting large amounts of ultritium.
 MRS. TROI / Of course you are. They planned to blow up the entire conference.
 PICARD / Take them to level five. Disarm them and hold for questioning.
 MRS. TROI / (sighing) Oh well, I didn't find a mate but I saved the conference as well as your reputations. All in a day's work I suppose.
 PICARD / Good-bye Mrs. Troi... and thank you.
 MRS. TROI / (scolding, excited) Jean-Luc! Shame on you for thinking such a thing!
 RIKER, PULASKI, GEORDI, DATA, and WORF, in that order, / sit around the table playing poker. By far, Worf has the biggest stack of chips.
 RIKER / (eyeing his cards) Lookin' good. I say... five.
 GEORDI / (adding chips) And five more.
 DATA / (evaluating) I believe the wiser course of action here is to bend.
 GEORDI / You mean fold.
 DATA / That is correct. Fold -- to bend, make compact or give in.
 WORF / I raise fifty.
 DATA / I do not believe Lieutenant Worf understands all the nuances of this betting procedure.
 RIKER / Don't be too quick to judge, Data. His pile's a lot bigger than yours.
 DATA / The cards have been favoring the Lieutenant, but that is the result of random chance... hence it is a temporary condition.
 GEORDI / You hope.
 WORF / Talk or play. Not both.
 RIKER / Fifty, right?
 RIKER / No, just my cards...
 RIKER / Got to earn them first.
 GEORDI / Talk, talk, talk...
 GEORDI / (backpedalling) Fold, fold, fold...
 WORF / Your fifty, and fifty more.
 RIKER / Love to stay in -- but not with these cards.
 RIKER / The Iceman wins again.
 GEORDI / Smiling might break his concentration.
 RIKER / We'd be happy to accommodate you.
 WORF / Your deal.
 DATA / The game is seven card stud; after the queen, one-eyed jacks and low card in the hole are wild.
 GEORDI / Let me write this down.
 RIKER / Just deal. I'd like to get some of my losings back before the next century.
 WORF / I open with fifty.
 RIKER / On my way.
 GEORDI / (to Worf) Fifty? You were bluffing.
 WORF / Klingons never bluff.
 PICARD ENTERS from the Ready Room. At Conn is a young / female: ENSIGN CLANCEY. Riker, Data, and Worf ENTER and take their stations; Data relieves the supernumerary at Ops, examines readouts.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / Emergency signal reads as follows: Enterprise to divert to coordinates four-two-three by one-one-two by five-one immediately. Further orders forthcoming.
 RIKER / That's it? What's the emergency?
 DATA / The message does not elaborate.
 RIKER / (to Picard) You'd think they'd at least give us a hint.
 PICARD / Warp eight. (to Riker) Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic, I know we're about to face a challenge.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Engage.
 DATA / Our destination is a point near the Boradis system.
 PICARD / That area was colonized fairly recently, as I recall.
 DATA / (nods) The first Federation outpost was established thirty-four years ago on Boradis Three.
 RIKER / And since then, the Federation has colonized several planets in that sector.
 DATA / Yet we are not headed for a specific colony. The coordinates given are outside the Boradis system.
 PICARD / Any problems reported in that area?
 DATA / None.
 PICARD / Then what the devil's going on?
 WORF / Captain, Starfleet Command is hailing us.
 PICARD / It's about time. On screen.
 PICARD / My compliments, Admiral Gromek.
 DATA / (nods to Picard) We are receiving.
 PICARD / Understood. And -- the mission?
 PICARD / Can you give me any details?
 PICARD / Admiral, I find it difficult to prepare for a mission I know nothing about.
 RIKER / Data, what ship is carrying the envoy?
 DATA / The envoy is not aboard a starship.
 PICARD / Indeed?
 DATA / Apparently there were no starships available at Starbase one five three. The emissary is aboard a class eight probe.
 RIKER / A class eight probe is just over two meters long!
 PICARD / (thinking) True, Number One. But if the sensors and transmitters were removed and life-support installed, there would be just enough space for one person.
 RIKER / And those probes are designed to go warp nine.
 DATA / (nods) By sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting the Enterprise to the starbase, they have saved us six point one hours.
 PICARD / Obviously Starfleet feels that time is of the essence.
 RIKER / Yes, but still... to seal someone up inside a Class Eight Probe and then just launch it off... (shakes his head) Hell of a way to transport a Federation dignitary.
 PICARD / (to Clancey) We'll need an intercept course with pin-point accuracy. The probe carrying the emissary has no means of navigation...
 RIKER / (finishing the thought) ... so if we don't catch it on the first try, we'll have to chase it.
 RIKER / Data -- if we project our course past the rendezvous coordinates, what lies ahead?
 DATA / As far as I can determine, sir -- very little. There are four colonies in the Boradis system, and nine other outposts scattered throughout the sector.
 GEORDI / Captain, we have a way to save you some time.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 RIKER / (a low whistle) Quite a trick.
 GEORDI / Right -- at warp speed it's nearly impossible to get a solid transporter lock. But if we caught the probe with a tractor beam...
 RIKER / (catching on) We could use the tractor beam to focus the transporter.
 GEORDI / Exactly.
 PICARD / Risks?
 GEORDI / None to the emissary. There's a chance the probe could break free... then we'd have to find it and start over.
 PICARD / So it's a gamble. (a beat) Odds, gentlemen?
 GEORDI / Twenty to one it'll work.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / We should now be on a precisely parallel course with the probe.
 PICARD / Increase to warp eight point nine.
 PICARD / Full sensors, aft.
 WORF / Scanning...
 WORF / I have it, sir. Bearing zero-five mark two-three-one; velocity warp nine.
 PICARD / Adjust speed to intercept.
 WORF / Probe coming up to starboard, range eighty-two hundred. Tractor beam ready.
 PICARD / (to com panel) Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / Transporter ready, Captain.
 WORF / Range now seventy-five hundred.
 PICARD / Steady as she goes...
 WORF / Probe is standing abeam.
 PICARD / Engage tractor.
 GEORDI / Okay, O'Brien, they've hooked it -- let's reel it in.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Energize.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. Number One?
 RIKER / I'll welcome our visitor.
 PICARD / (to Clancey) Resume original course and speed.
 PICARD / Well done, everyone.
 RIKER / Something wrong, Doctor?
 RIKER / (a Klingon greeting) nuqneH. qaleghneS.
 RIKER / A little. I am Commander Riker, and this is our chief medical officer, Katherine Pulaski.
 RIKER (cont'd) / I hope your voyage wasn't too unpleasant.
 RIKER / I don't blame you. (re the probe) Not the most luxurious accommodations Starfleet has to offer...
 RIKER / Captain, I'd like to present Special Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. (introducing) Counselor Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data, and --
 WORF / I have nothing to say to you.
 RIKER / When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war...
 PICARD / Which suggests that the crew was in cryogenic sleep for most of the long voyage.
 RIKER / And when the crew is revived...
 PICARD / So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons we are no longer at war.
 RIKER / Why us? A Klingon ship would have been a better choice.
 TROI / Why too late?
 RIKER / Because the T'Ong's crew is about to awaken within striking range of a dozen Federation outposts.
 DATA / There are thirteen colonies with minimal defenses in that sector...
 TROI / And you believe you can convince these Klingons that humans are now their allies?
 PICARD / (calmly) No.
 PICARD / Find me another choice. I want some options -- and I want them before we encounter the Klingon ship. (to Worf) Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to help the emissary. Dismissed.
 TROI / (to K'Ehleyr) I'll escort you to the guest quarters.
 PICARD / Lieutenant?
 WORF / Sir... I suggest Commander Riker or Data would better serve Special Emissary K'Ehleyr.
 PICARD / Are there personal reasons you don't want the assignment?
 WORF / Yes.
 PICARD / Any professional reasons?
 WORF / (after a beat) No.
 WORF (cont'd) / I withdraw my request, Captain.
 PICARD / Good.
 TROI / I didn't know it was possible for a human and a Klingon to produce a child.
 TROI / I know exactly what you mean. My father was human... and my mother was Betazoid.
 TROI / I never felt trapped -- I felt fortunate. I experienced the richness and diversity of two worlds.
 TROI / (with a smile) I doubt that.
 TROI / And your Klingon side?
 TROI / Why hide it? We all have tempers...
 TROI / And that frightens you.
 TROI / Yet it gives you strength. It's part of you.
 WORF / You are late.
 WORF / I fail to understand why.
 WORF / (ignoring) Shall we proceed with our assigned duties?
 WORF / I would prefer to keep this professional.
 WORF / And I feel no need to explain.
 WORF / Did you come on board the Enterprise to work, or to discuss your pointless fantasies?
 WORF / He became a Starfleet lieutenant.
 WORF / I have no wish to make you believe anything.
 WORF / There is nothing wrong with my memory.
 WORF / I am familiar with your appearance.
 WORF / I never?
 WORF / Not as far as I'm concerned.
 WORF / According to the library computer, the captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc. But there is nothing regarding the ship's mission.
 WORF / You're not interested in why the ship was sent out?
 WORF / Perhaps, but we have no evidence of that --
 WORF / The records may simply have been lost.
 WORF / And to contend with that threat, we need information.
 WORF / That is foolish. Knowing their mission might help us understand them --
 WORF / I do not appreciate being interrupted.
 WORF / We were instructed to come up with options --
 WORF / (strained patience) There are always options.
 WORF / My experience aboard this ship has taught me that most problems have more than one solution.
 WORF / (losing his temper) Are you going to carry out your duties or aren't you?
 TROI / You're upset.
 TROI / Well -- that, and the table.
 TROI / May I make a suggestion?
 TROI / Actually, I was going to suggest something else.
 TROI / I find the Holodeck exercise programs rigorous enough to put my mind off most frustrations.
 TROI / That, too...
 PICARD / Status.
 DATA / Based on the last assumed position of the Klingon vessel, its apparent trajectory, and our estimates of their cruising speed, we should be in scanner range in fifteen hours, eight minutes.
 PICARD / Lieutenant?
 WORF / Special Emissary K'Ehleyr has... declared a short recess, sir. I wish to run a full diagnostic test on all tactical back-up equipment.
 RIKER / (puzzled) We just ran a full test of those systems.
 WORF / (testy) I feel it necessary to check them again.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, I commend your diligence. However, I'm concerned that you're working yourself too hard.
 WORF / Sir, considering the unknown elements we are about to face --
 PICARD / (cuts him off) Lieutenant -- I order you to relax.
 WORF / (tense) I am relaxed. (on his look) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / I've never seen the Lieutenant so... unsettled.
 RIKER / (nods) The Iceman's finally melting.
 WORF / Computer. Level Two.
 WORF / You can still make jokes?
 WORF / You are most observant.
 WORF / I did not say that.
 WORF / I've noted that some people use humor as a shield... they talk much yet say little.
 WORF / (almost apologetic) When one does not have the words...
 WORF / We were not ready.
 WORF / (shakes his head) We were both too young -- too unaware. We lacked commitment.
 WORF / No longer.
 WORF / tlhIngan jIH.
 WORF / (simply) We have mated.
 WORF / And now we must solemnize our union with the oath --
 WORF / -- and pledge that we are one forever.
 WORF / You already are.
 WORF / You would dishonor our sacred traditions?
 WORF / None of which stopped you earlier.
 WORF / (with disdain) That is a human attitude.
 WORF / You are also Klingon!
 WORF / It is our way!
 WORF / tlhIngan jIH!
 WORF / (a roar) Then this night had no meaning! (then, softer) And that, I will not believe.
 PICARD / Slow to impulse.
 PICARD / Lay in a standard search pattern.
 PICARD / Full impulse. Engage.
 RIKER / I just hope we find them before they come out of their nap.
 PICARD / Agreed. No outpost in this sector could defend itself against a Klingon warship.
 WORF / Your devotion to duty is commendable... if belated.
 WORF / (stiffly) I am here to assist you.
 WORF / I've asked Lieutenant Commander Data to help us analyze the alternatives.
 DATA / "Android" is, of course, correct, but I fail to see how "chaperone" is applicable in this situation...
 WORF / Honor demanded no less.
 DATA / At the moment, I would be hard pressed to choose.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Is that feasible?
 GEORDI / (nods) We can beam an away team onto the T'Ong and override the cryogenic controls.
 TROI / ... so that when the T'Ong's crew awakens, they're surrounded by their fellow Klingons.
 RIKER / That would be ideal.
 GEORDI / They discover they're in Federation territory -- and they attack the nearest outpost.
 TROI / Are we sure they'll attack?
 RIKER / We don't even know what the T'Ong's mission was.
 TROI / It may have been a scientific voyage.
 RIKER / The point is, they may not be warlike.
 PICARD / Could the T'Ong be disabled rather than destroyed?
 GEORDI / We could probably knock out their warp engines without damaging the rest of their ship...
 WORF / (nods) Klingons do not surrender.
 PICARD / I will not accept that. There must be a way to make the Klingons listen. If we can only convince them --
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Captain, we have detected a ship, bearing three-one-six mark forty-two, extreme sensor range.
 PICARD / Plot an intercept course. And go to Yellow Alert.
 WORF / Shields are up.
 PICARD / Hold this position. Let's see if they've spotted us. (to Data) Magnification one hundred.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / Sensors show lifeforms aboard, sir, but I am unable to ascertain if they are awake or dormant. (checks a reading) However, the vessel's propulsion systems are inactive, so I would hypothesize that the crew is asleep --
 DATA / However, I could be in error.
 WORF / Shields holding.
 RIKER / They've cloaked themselves.
 GEORDI / Transfer Engineering to bridge.
 PICARD / Can you find them?
 GEORDI / (working at the station) I think so. Those old shields weren't a hundred percent efficient at blocking gamma-ray output. If I can tune the sensors to a particular band of... (jubilant) There! Got 'em! Transferring coordinates to helm...
 PICARD / (to Clancey) Intercept. Warp two.
 WORF / Captain... I have another option.
 DATA / The T'Ong has changed course to three-two mark eight-one. They are increasing to warp three.
 RIKER / Standard evasive maneuver.
 PICARD / Helm -- stay with them.
 DATA / The T'Ong is now on a heading of four-one mark one-one-three... accelerating to warp five.
 RIKER / They're making a break for it.
 PICARD / Overtake. Warp eight.
 PICARD / Put us right in their path and come to a full stop. (to Tactical) Full power to shields.
 PICARD / We've thrown down the gauntlet... let's see if they pick it up.
 DATA / They are slowing to impulse --
 DATA / The T'Ong is attempting to flank us.
 PICARD / Compensate.
 RIKER / I think we've piqued their curiosity by now...
 PICARD / Agreed. Let's give them the chance to look their enemy in the face.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Ready, Lieutenant? (then to Tactical) Open a hailing frequency.
 WORF / (imperious) Captain K'Temoc -- have you lost your mind? Halt your ship and drop your shields.
 WORF / I am Worf, commanding the Enterprise. It is you who have committed an act of treason -- by firing upon this ship.
 WORF / You fool. Did it not occur to you that the war would be over by now?
 WORF / Trust your eyes! Or is your brain still stuck in its long slumber?
 WORF / Captain, as you are new to this century, I have tried to be patient. But I will tolerate no further insubordination. Drop your shields immediately.
 WORF / Then die in ignorance. I can waste no more time on you. (to Tactical) Phasers to full power.
 WORF / Has the T'Ong dropped its shields?
 WORF / (with a shrug) Very well. Fire all phasers --
 WORF / A wise decision, Captain. Commander K'Ehleyr will board your ship and take command. The Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon arrive and escort you home. (almost an afterthought) And, Captain --
 WORF / Welcome to the twenty-fourth century.
 WORF / (to Picard) I return command of the ship to you, Captain.
 PICARD / Thank you and congratulations, Lieutenant. A very fine first command. Well done.
 GEORDI / That's all, Worf? Just a nod?
 RIKER / How did you like command?
 WORF / Comfortable chair.
 WORF / (to O'Brien) One to beam aboard the T'Ong.
 WORF / I relieve you.
 WORF / The Klingon vessel P'rang will rendezvous with you in three days.
 WORF / Is there anything else you require?
 WORF / What needs to be said?
 WORF / And that disturbs you?
 WORF / (after a beat) Nor have I.
 WORF / K'Ehleyr... I will not be complete without you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42923.7. We are en route to the Braslota System, site of the first Starfleet battle simulation. Joining the Enterprise as observer and mediator is the Zakdorn Master Strategist, Sirna Kolrami. Despite misgivings, I have agreed to Starfleet's request that we take part in these wargame exercises.
 DATA is at Command, supernumeraries at Conn and OPS, / and WORF and ENSIGN BURKE confer at Tactical. All heads turn as the forward turbolift opens and RIKER and KOLRAMI, a slender weasel-like creature, ENTER and cross to the Observation Lounge.
 PICARD / (rising, extending his hand) Mister Kolrami -- Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard.
 PICARD / Would you care to be shown to your quarters?
 WORF / Despite their reputations, this Zakdorn does not appear to be a very formidable warrior.
 DATA / In the game of military brinksmanship, individual physical prowess is less important than the perception of a species as a whole. For over nine millennia potential foes have regarded the Zakdorns as having the greatest innately strategic minds in the galaxy.
 WORF / And no one is willing to test that perception in combat.
 DATA / Exactly.
 WORF / Then the reputation means nothing.
 PICARD / Commander Riker will captain the Hathaway.
 RIKER / And we'll be experiencing actual battle conditions?
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / Starfleet is not a military organization. Our purpose is exploration.
 PICARD / Because with the Borg threat, I have decided that my officers and I need to hone our tactical skills.
 PICARD (Cont'd) / In a crisis situation, it is prudent to have several options.
 RIKER / I still prefer brains over brawn. (to Kolrami) I think it's a waste of effort to test our combat skills -- it's a minor province in the make-up of a starship captain.
 RIKER / Mister Kolrami, when I agree to do a thing. I do it. (to Picard, lighter) Care to surrender now, Captain?
 PICARD / Well, Number One, you are allowed a complement of forty. Select whom you will. Save Data, who will serve as my first officer in your absence.
 PICARD / On my ship, the leader of an away team has total control of the mission. If you want to judge "leadership" -- why not start at the beginning?
 PICARD / (admonishingly) Now, Doctor...
 DATA / The Zakdornian culture is replete with self-assuredness and confidence. It is seldom undeserved. For example, Kolrami is a third level grand master at the game of Strategema.
 GEORDI / (giving directions) Another millimeter... little more... there! Excellent.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Lieutenant.
 GEORDI / Commander.
 RIKER / You've heard of the simulation aboard the Hathaway?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir, and the best of luck to you. I've researched the old Avidyne engines -- archaic by our standards, very touchy.
 RIKER / Anticipating the worst, do you think it can be whipped into shape in forty-eight hours?
 GEORDI / (smiling broadly) I've taken the liberty of packing a few necessities.
 WORF / Enter!
 RIKER / Am I disturbing you?
 WORF / Just finishing, Commander.
 RIKER / "Interesting" quarters.
 WORF / Thank you.
 RIKER / You know of the simulation. What do you think?
 WORF / Waste of time.
 RIKER / It's just designed to be an exercise.
 WORF / Useless. If there is nothing to lose -- no sacrifice -- then there is nothing to gain.
 RIKER / (playing him) You mean -- besides "pride." (caught his attention) Well, it's a good thing in this case, because I probably don't have a chance.
 WORF / (alien concept) There is always a chance.
 RIKER / Slim. The Hathaway's most sophisticated weapon-systems -- even in a computer mock-up -- can't hope to defeat the Enterprise.
 WORF / Still...
 RIKER / Worf... when you're out-gunned, out-manned, and out-equipped -- what else do you have left?
 WORF / (long beat) Guile.
 RIKER / Join me.
 WORF / The honor is to serve.
 PICARD / Begin long-range scanning of all sectors within three light years of Braslota. (seeing Riker) How is your crew shaping up?
 RIKER / It's complete, but I would like to request an addition.
 PICARD / (playing along) Anyone in mind?
 RIKER / With your permission, I would like Acting Ensign Crusher aboard for educational observation.
 RIKER / (as if an afterthought) Oh... since we have some time before reaching Braslota -- (deferentially to Kolrami) I was hoping that you would agree to play me in a game of Strategema.
 RIKER / I enjoy a challenge.
 RIKER / Thank you.
 GEORDI / So you're going to beat him?
 RIKER / Nope.
 GEORDI / Oh, then it's going to be a close one.
 RIKER / No.
 GEORDI / But you have got a chance?
 RIKER / Nah.
 GEORDI / (a little sarcastic) Are you planning to show up?
 RIKER / Sure, Kolrami is the best at Strategema. To even get to play him is a privilege.
 GEORDI / Other than you being privileged, is there anything else I can look forward to?
 RIKER / Nope.
 GEORDI / This is going to be exciting.
 GEORDI / I wouldn't bet on us being here that long.
 WORF / (confiding to Riker) I have wagered heavily in the ship's pool that you will take him past the sixth plateau.
 RIKER / What if I don't?
 WORF / I will be... irritated.
 DATA / Forever curious, this urge to "compete."
 DATA / Doctor, there are other ways to challenge oneself.
 TROI / Data, sometimes humans find it helpful to have an outsider set the standard by which they're judged.
 DATA / (catching on) To avoid deceiving oneself.
 DATA / (surprised) Why?
 GEORDI / Yeah, Data, I'd like to see your neural-flecks tear him down a peg.
 DATA / To what end?
 WORF / Computer -- actuation positions for Strategema.
 WORF / Ready?
 WORF / (continuing) Begin!
 RIKER / (numb admiration) I'm afraid so.
 RIKER / Yes. (to Kolrami) Congratulations.
 PICARD / (keeping it light) Commander Riker -- (re: Hathaway) There is your next challenge.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Away team assembled and ready to transport, Commander.
 PICARD / (playful) Until we test our mettle on the field of honor.
 RIKER / (with a grin) I may get over there and want to come right home.
 PICARD / (chuckles) Good luck, Number One... Captain.
 WORF / Not good.
 RIKER / Oh, Mister Worf, you're wrong. It's fantastic... and it's ours --
 RIKER / (continuing) Mister Worf.
 WORF / Sir, Lieutenant La Forge is a superior officer. The honor should be his.
 RIKER / Worf, this is a battle simulation, and you're our tactical officer. Mister La Forge and I agreed, you need to be at my side.
 GEORDI / And if the engine room is anything like the bridge, I'm going to have my hands full.
 RIKER / Attention crew of the USS Hathaway -- this is your captain. (boy, he likes the sound of that) I can promise you that two days from now we will have missed a lot of sleep. But with your skill and your stamina, we'll have this old lady ready to fly. (hard beat) I want hourly progress reports from every station. Riker out.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / It's a real mess down here, but we'll get to work on it.
 RIKER / I'm sure you'll perform your usual miracle.
 RIKER / (continuing) Nice work, Geordi, now what's the possibility for warp drive?
 GEORDI / There are only minute dilithium fragments left in the holding clamps. And even if we had intact crystals, there's no anti-matter to fuel the drive.
 RIKER / Any recommendations?
 GEORDI / No, sir.
 WESLEY / We don't have a prayer.
 RIKER / (thoughtful beat) Would you care to transfer back to the Enterprise, Mister Crusher?
 WESLEY / (quickly) No, Sir!
 RIKER / (gentler) Remember Wes, the purpose here is to improvise. It's the effort that counts.
 PICARD / Open.
 PICARD / The weapons conversion, Lieutenant Burke?
 WORF / (on viewer) Signal received... locked on.
 RIKER / She's really been stripped down, Captain.
 RIKER / What's the Zakdornian word for "mismatch?"
 PICARD / Screen off. Data, you have the bridge.
 DATA / But I have expressed no such interest.
 DATA / Indeed I...
 DATA / (continuing lamely) ...Cannot.
 WORF / With my knowledge of the Enterprise's security override, we may be able to convince the sensors that an enemy ship is approaching. Their instruments would "lie" to them.
 RIKER / If you can pull that off, Mister Worf, it might just give us the edge we're looking for.
 WORF / If I am successful, the computer will project a false image of the enemy ship on the main viewscreen.
 RIKER / And unless they run to a window and look out....
 WESLEY / The lining is still smooth, and we ought to be able to do something with the dilithium chips we scavenged. (looks at Geordi)
 GEORDI / Sure the system is functional, but without antimatter what difference does it make?
 WESLEY / (continuing) Geordi, I have to return to the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / Wes, we've only got thirty-two hours.
 WESLEY / (as he exits) This is important.
 GEORDI / This isn't? (re the engines)
 WORF / Attempt the routing bypass here! If it works, they will be surprised.
 WORF / Anywhere.
 WESLEY / Sir, I left an experiment running on the Enterprise. May I go back and shut it down?
 RIKER / (a little distracted) It's that important?
 WESLEY / It has to be monitored. And it is my final grade in plasma physics.
 DATA / (re: Pulaski) In the present context, what did she mean by, "Bust him up?"
 TROI / Doctor Pulaski, in her own way, is instructing you to take the shortest route to victory.
 DATA / As opposed to what?
 TROI / (delicate) You advanced quite far against such a worthy opponent.
 DATA / Thank you, but there would be no point.
 DATA / Obviously I am not.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / I'd like to request permission for Ensign Crusher to reboard the Enterprise, Captain.
 PICARD / Why?
 RIKER / Apparently he was in such a hurry to be part of the away team, he left several critical experiments unattended.
 PICARD / Have you any objection?
 PICARD / (to Riker) Permission granted. (to Burke) Mister Burke, handle that.
 WESLEY / I can't believe I forgot about this. Good lesson not to let excitement cloud your thinking.
 WESLEY / This is really delicate ... I spent six weeks setting it up.
 WESLEY / Oh, no. It's ruined.
 WESLEY / I have to dispose of it safely... This is really volatile... I better beam it off the Enterprise and leave it particalized.
 WESLEY / I'll transfer the coordinates to the Transporter Room.
 PICARD / Where is Commander Data?
 PICARD / How so?
 PICARD / Mister Kolrami -- may I speak with you in private?
 PICARD / I would like to know the root of your prejudice for my second-in-command.
 PICARD / Mister Kolrami -- you have been nothing but denigrating and abusive of Commander Riker since boarding this ship. I should like an explanation.
 PICARD / In what regard?
 PICARD / (ice frosting the words) Don't confuse style with intent. Only a fool would question Commander Riker's dedication to Starfleet and the men and women under his command. Riker is the finest officer I have ever served with.
 PICARD / The test is if a crew will follow where Commander Riker leads. His joviality is the way he creates that loyalty. And I'll match his command style against your statistics anytime.
 DATA / Come in, please.
 TROI / (softly) Data?
 DATA / Counselor. Is something wrong?
 TROI / That was going to be my question.
 DATA / With my repository of knowledge, I expected to perform better against a humanoid life-form.
 TROI / Some of our greatest advances have come from analyzing failure. While it can be ego-bruising --
 DATA / Counselor -- I do not have an "ego."
 TROI / Yes... well, a loss... can be disheartening --
 DATA / Counselor -- I do not have a --
 TROI / Data! There are two ways to handle defeat. You can lose confidence or you can learn from your mistakes.
 DATA / That is what troubles me. I made no mistakes. (beat; very matter of fact) Hence, I have conducted a diagnostic check of all of my programs, and now I am cross-checking with the ship's computer.
 TROI / Is all of that necessary?
 DATA / I believe so. I have proven to be vulnerable, and at the present time, skepticism must be awarded my deductions.
 TROI / That is why you haven't been on the bridge.
 DATA / Yes, the captain would be ill advised to rely upon my judgement.
 TROI / Data, I think you're really overreacting. I'm sure you're all right.
 DATA / I, however, am not sure.
 RIKER / What's that?
 WESLEY / My experiment from the Enterprise.
 RIKER / (a little suspicious) Wes?
 WESLEY / It dealt with high-energy plasma reactions -- (points to the globe) -- with anti-matter.
 RIKER / You went back to the Enterprise just to get this... Wes, you cheated.
 WESLEY / No, sir. You told me to improvise.
 GEORDI / (grinning) The hard part's gonna be calibrating the thermal curve required to start a controlled reaction.
 RIKER / Assuming you can -- can you regulate the reaction?
 WESLEY (O.S.) / There's just enough crystal to do it.
 WESLEY / We plan to channel the reaction through the chips.
 GEORDI / (smiling broadly) Are we good?
 RIKER / (impressed) Better than good. Great. Brilliant. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (almost to himself) This is going to be fun. (back to business) Carry on.
 DATA / Come in, please.
 DATA / Doctor?
 DATA / I am running diagnostic --
 DATA / No, Doctor, this is not ego. I am concerned about giving the captain unsound advice.
 DATA / For what? It is done, and perhaps just as well. This has indicated that I am damaged in some fashion. I must find the malfunction.
 RIKER / The simulation begins in one hour.
 GEORDI / You'll have warp drive, Captain, though it may not be what you expected.
 RIKER / I'd say that calls for an explanation.
 GEORDI / Sir, we'll be able to give you warp one... (a glance to Wesley)
 WESLEY / -- for just under two seconds.
 RIKER / (making the best) Well, not enough for an escape but used as a surprise, sufficient for gaining a strategic advantage.
 GEORDI / Sir, all of this is "theoretical."
 RIKER / And if the theory fails to pay off?
 GEORDI / Ever driven a Grenthemen Water Hopper?
 RIKER / Yes.
 GEORDI / Ever popped the clutch?
 RIKER / You're telling me we'll stall the Hathaway.
 WESLEY / ... and the Enterprise will waltz over and pulverize us.
 PICARD / Now, let me see if I fully understand this. You're suggesting that Commander Data is suffering from a profound loss of confidence, and you feel that only I can restore the balance.
 TROI / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Don't you think you both might be overreacting? Data is not capable of the emotions you are assigning to him.
 PICARD / I am less than an hour away from a battle simulation, and I must handhold an android?
 DATA / Come in, please.
 PICARD / Commander, I require your presence on the bridge.
 DATA / Captain, with all due respect, perhaps it would be better if you choose another to serve as your first --
 PICARD / (interrupting) Data, you are my first officer.
 DATA / I have not been able to isolate the problem. I might make a mistake.
 PICARD / Yes, you might. But that does not alter your duty -- to this ship, and to me. (a beat) Do you know how to formulate a premise?
 DATA / Yes.
 PICARD / Then formulate one now: How do I handle Riker and the Hathaway? I'll await your answer on the bridge.
 PICARD / (continuing) Commander, it is possible to commit no mistakes -- and still lose. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (strong beat) That is not a weakness. That is "life".
 DATA / Thank you, Captain, I believe I understand.
 PICARD / And Data, leave the hesitation and self-doubt in your quarters.
 DATA / I have several examples of Commander Riker's battle technique. At the Academy, he calculated a sensory blind spot on a Tholian vessel and hid within it during a battle simulation. And as a lieutenant aboard the Potemkin, his solution to a crisis was to shut down all power, and hang over a planet's magnetic pole, thus confusing his opponent's sensors.
 TROI / And from these specifics, what general conclusion can you extrapolate?
 DATA / Only twenty-one percent of the time does he rely upon traditional tactics.
 DATA / (continuing) So the captain must be prepared for extreme cunning. (pausing as a new thought intrudes) Counselor, Commander Riker will assume that we have made this analysis, and knowing that we know his methods, he will alter them. (a new equally bad thought) But knowing that we know that he knows that we know he might choose to return to his usual pattern.
 TROI / You're over-analyzing. Human nature cannot be denied. (a beat) What kind of man is Commander Riker?
 DATA / He is a fighter.
 TROI / Yes.
 DATA / The weaker his position, the more aggressive will be his posture.
 TROI / And he won't give up.
 DATA / Then despite whatever logical choices he is offered, he must be --
 TROI / -- The man that he is. Yes.
 DATA / Is that a failing in humans?
 TROI / (rising) You'll have to decide that for yourself.
 PICARD / Screen on.
 PICARD / The hunt begins, Number One.
 RIKER / (playful bravado) We're ready -- just remember, Enterprise -- Captain Riker has never lost.
 PICARD / (to Conn) Screen off. Set course two-two-three mark two-five-seven, full impulse power. Initiate Kumeh maneuver.
 GEORDI / The Kumeh maneuver -- why are they starting out with such a recognizable ploy?
 RIKER / He's teasing -- wants us to reveal our tactics on his terms. Worf?
 WORF / Counter with Talupian stratagem on instrument sighting.
 RIKER / Agreed. Three-quarters impulse, full on my command. Ensign Nagel, maximum shields. (to Worf) Mister Worf, prepare your little surprise.
 PICARD / Course three-one-seven mark seven-three. Present minimal aspect. Ready warp one, optimal spread on simulated torpedoes.
 PICARD / What the -- ?!
 PICARD / (standing; to Conn) Bring us about, Ensign -- maximum shields!
 DATA / Disengage modified beams.
 PICARD / Weapon-systems full -- lock on! Open a hailing frequency.
 PICARD / Warp three, evasive! (the "scores" stop) Disengage weapons, re-engage modified beam.
 PICARD / He is the best!
 DATA / Computer reports simulated damage to several aft decks. Repair time three-point-six days.
 PICARD / Mister Worf must have overridden our sensor codes and played some holographic games. Data, input a new code. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) Attack posture, circumvental attitude. Prepare beams for photon mode.
 WORF / Computers report heavy damage to Enterprise, sir.
 WESLEY / They're moving off. Why not go after them?
 RIKER / (not buying it) Because they're not through coming after us! Geordi, Wesley -- prepare warp jump.
 GEORDI / (nervous) There are no guarantees here, sir.
 RIKER / There never are, Lieutenant. I'm going to trust your expertise.
 RIKER / (continuing; a true captain) Secure your stations, gentlemen. Stand by for my signal.
 PICARD / Ready photon torpedoes.
 PICARD / Did you input that new code?
 PICARD / Mister Worf -- I didn't give you enough credit, continue the simulation.
 PICARD / Divert all power to shields!
 DATA / Sever modified beams, engage phasers and target!
 PICARD / Stay between the Hathaway and the Ferengi!
 WORF / We must assist, sir!
 RIKER / With what?! We have no offensive weapons!
 PICARD / Where are my weapons?
 PICARD / Unacceptable! I have crew on the Hathaway.
 DATA / Captain, the Ferengi have broken off their attack. (to Burke) Drop shields. Transport the away team aboard.
 DATA / Shields reduced to one-fifth intensity.
 PICARD / I have forty crewmembers --
 PICARD / Not to me! (to Burke) Notify Starfleet -- priority. Hail Ferengi on my command. (to Data) Formulate alternatives.
 PICARD / (thundering) I am the captain of this vessel! Your order is nullified!
 PICARD / (continuing) Ferengi on Main Viewer.
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Federation Starship, USS Enterprise. Why have you attacked my ship?
 PICARD / I have refrained from launching a counter-attack in the hope that we can resolve this peacefully.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / Our shields will not withstand another assault.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Due to a grave miscalculation on my part, the Enterprise has been subjected to a withering attack by the Ferengi. I find myself with little time to decide the fate of forty of my crew stranded aboard the derelict Hathaway.
 PICARD / I'm open to suggestions.
 PICARD / On screen. Have you been monitoring communications, Number One?
 RIKER / Yes, sir. And Kolrami's right. You must save the Enterprise.
 PICARD / You will be left defenseless.
 RIKER / When Bractor closes in, we'll hit our warp drive and take our chances.
 PICARD / Your what?!
 RIKER / (with pride) We have a limited, two-second warp capability.
 PICARD / (formulating an idea) I told you he was the best. (to Riker) I should wish to hear about this later, but now I need to work something out with Data.
 DATA / Premise: The Ferengi wish to capture the Hathaway believing it to be of value. Therefore, we must remove the ship from their field of interest.
 PICARD / (cutting him off) There is a way. Are you with us, Number One?
 RIKER / Yes, sir. We're all here -- anxiously waiting for you to pull another rabbit out of your hat.
 PICARD / Data.
 DATA / At the captain's signal, we will fire four photon torpedoes directly at the Hathaway. A millisecond before detonation, the computer will trigger your warp jump.
 GEORDI / (lightly) I think I hate this plan. (sobering) Data, we don't even know for sure if our warp jump will work.
 DATA / If the warp engines should fail to function, the result could be... unfortunate.
 WORF / Very unfortunate... we will be dead.
 PICARD / Captain Riker, I can't order you to do this...
 RIKER / (a beat) What the hell. Nobody said life was safe.
 PICARD / The advantage is that it will appear from the Kreechta's perspective -- as though you were destroyed in the explosion.
 WORF / That will only deceive them for a few minutes. Their sensors will soon locate us.
 RIKER / A few minutes is all we need, Mister Worf, because you're going to prepare a surprise for them.
 PICARD / Then we are agreed; on my mark in four minutes.
 DATA / Remember, Geordi, if the implementation is off by a millisecond, the Hathaway will not survive.
 GEORDI / Data, that's the one part of this plan that we're all absolutely sure about.
 PICARD / Are we ready, Number One?
 PICARD / Good luck to both of you. (beat; to Burke) Bractor.
 PICARD / You needn't, Bractor. The answer -- is "no." (beat) Your actions have been wholly criminal, and you will not profit by them.
 PICARD / You feel the Hathaway has value? Well, I deny you your prize. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (to Burke) Fire!
 PICARD / You had no claim to that ship -- it was ours to destroy.
 PICARD / (unperturbed) You can try.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Of course not, Mister Burke. That was Klingon guile.
 PICARD / You made it, Number One. Smooth ride?
 RIKER / (wryly) Different!
 PICARD / We'll lock on and pick you up.
 RIKER / With pleasure.
 PICARD / Thank you, Mister Kolrami. (to the crew) Initiate recovery procedures, continue repairs, plot a course for the nearest starbase.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. With the transporter repaired and my crew safely back aboard, we have officially ended the first Starfleet battle simulation.
 DATA / Why have you suspended the game?
 RIKER / Data, you beat him!
 DATA / No, sir -- it is a stalemate.
 WORF / No game of Strategema has ever gone this high.
 GEORDI / What did you do?
 DATA / I simply altered my "premise" for playing.
 RIKER / Explain.
 DATA / Working under the assumption that Kolrami is attempting to win, it is reasonable to assume that he expects me to play for the same goal.
 WESLEY / You weren't?
 DATA / No. I was playing only for a standoff -- a "draw." While Kolrami was dedicated to winning, I was able to pass up obvious avenues of advancement and settle for a balance. (android pride) Theoretically, I should be able to challenge him indefinitely.
 DATA / A matter of perspective. In the strictest sense I did not win.
 TROI_PULASKI / Data!
 DATA / I busted him up.
 GEORDI is moving through some underbrush. / 
 GEORDI / Commander?
 RIKER (O.S.) / I'm over here, Geordi.
 GEORDI / What's wrong?
 RIKER / Something jabbed me in the calf...
 GEORDI / (touches his communicator) O'Brien -- Commander Riker's been injured -- lock on and bring him up.
 RIKER / Geordi, it's just --
 GEORDI / (finishes it) A scratch. Right. Sorry, Commander, but we can't take any chances. We're the first survey team to set foot on this planet... we don't know what the risks are.
 GEORDI / What's the hold up, O'Brien?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Can't the biofilters screen them out?
 GEORDI / Acknowledged.
 RIKER / I didn't want to leave just yet, anyway.
 RIKER / I was walking along, minding my own business, making a simple geological sweep... and something stuck me in the leg.
 RIKER / No -- a little numb, that's all.
 GEORDI / We've been looking for it, but no luck.
 RIKER / I can walk to the table, thank you.
 RIKER / Doctor, for personal reasons, I'll walk.
 RIKER / I've always had the notion that if I was ever so injured that I couldn't make it on my own two feet... it would be over.
 RIKER / You'll get no argument from me, but... that's how I feel.
 RIKER (cont'd) / Whoa --
 RIKER (cont'd) / This is the strangest feeling. My whole leg just went -- dead.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1. During a geological survey of Surata Four, Commander Riker has become infected by an unidentified microbe.
 PICARD / Number One.
 RIKER / Captain.
 PICARD / Put your foot where it didn't belong, did you?
 RIKER / (nods) The doctor's been getting bored lately. I thought I'd find her a challenge...
 PICARD / Can you remove it?
 RIKER / That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract them.
 RIKER / (nods) My leg's still asleep.
 PICARD / (to Pulaski) Your prognosis?
 PICARD / And if it interfered with neural activity there...
 PICARD / How can I help?
 PICARD / And for that, you need a sample.
 PICARD / Mister Data, Mister La Forge -- prepare to beam down to the planet.
 DATA and Geordi are preparing to mount the platform. / Each carries a tricorder and a large phaser. O'Brien is behind the console.
 DATA / I must reiterate that it would be better if I went alone.
 GEORDI / Don't like my company?
 DATA / Your company is not at issue. Your vulnerability to this microorganism is.
 GEORDI / I'll watch where I step. Besides, how do we know that this bug doesn't like androids even more than it likes humans?
 DATA / Possible, but highly unlikely. In any event, why risk both of us?
 GEORDI / Because I know exactly where Commander Riker was when it happened.
 GEORDI / He was right over here.
 DATA / I detect no animal life within fifty kilometers. Merely vegetation. (a beat) However, I am reading extensive animal remains -- mostly fossilized.
 GEORDI / A graveyard?
 DATA / I do not know.
 GEORDI / Look at this.
 DATA / The structure is rhizomatous.
 GEORDI / Be careful.
 DATA / I am always careful.
 DATA / It appears to be dead.
 GEORDI / I'm not so sure. I can see thermal variations... (gets an idea) Data, set it down. Let's try something.
 GEORDI (cont'd) / Perhaps it likes humans more than androids.
 DATA / If you are correct, you are placing yourself in grave danger.
 GEORDI / I'm counting on those great android reflexes of yours...
 GEORDI / I'd say that's what we're looking for.
 DATA / I would tend to agree.
 GEORDI / (touches communicator) O'Brien! Stand by! (to Data) Hold it still.
 GEORDI (cont'd) / Got it. Energize!
 GEORDI / Thanks, O'Brien. Another minute, and we'd've been fossils ourselves.
 DATA / Not precisely, Geordi. True fossilization requires several millennia.
 GEORDI / Captain, here's your sample.
 PICARD / Get it to Sickbay right away.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Report.
 DATA / Captain, the commander's injury was not accidental. Certain vines on the planet evidently seek out warm-blooded beings and deliberately infect them.
 PICARD / To what end?
 DATA / Unknown. It is conceivable that there is a symbiotic relationship involved...
 PICARD / Go on.
 DATA / There were numerous animal remains in the area, leading me to hypothesize that the vines could be predatory.
 PICARD / Then they infect animals in order to kill them.
 DATA / It is possible. (a beat) For Commander Riker's sake, I hope my hypothesis is in error.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, Mister Data, your hypotheses rarely are.
 PICARD / There's nothing that will cure this infection?
 PICARD / Or how to kill it.
 PICARD / I know you're doing your best...
 PICARD / Comfortable?
 RIKER / How could I not be comfortable? I'm being waited on hand and foot.
 RIKER (cont'd) / My only worry is that they'll find out I'm faking it.
 PICARD / I wish you were faking it. I've seen the thorn, Number One.
 RIKER / The doctor showed it to me, too. Harmless-looking thing, isn't it?
 PICARD / But deadly. (a beat) I'm sorry.
 RIKER / These things happen.
 PICARD / When you least expect them.
 RIKER / I'm surprised they don't happen more often. After all, we are exploring the unknown.
 PICARD / And now and then we are humbled... reminded that the universe contains much that is beautiful... and much that is malevolent.
 RIKER / Captain, I hardly think the vine that struck me did so out of malice. (a beat) If I've learned anything aboard this ship... from our voyages... from you... it's that most life forms act out of an instinct for survival -- not out of evil.
 PICARD / A worthy lesson. I admire your lack of rancor, Number One.
 RIKER / Captain, if you drop a hammer on your foot, it's rather useless to get mad at the hammer.
 PICARD / Anything?
 PICARD / Doctor, we're running out of time.
 PICARD (cont'd) / You're right. I don't need to remind you of your duties. I didn't mean to give offense.
 PICARD / Aye aye, Doctor.
 RIKER / This bug's persistent, I'll admit. But I'm not worried. We Rikers are ornery, too...
 RIKER (cont'd) / In fact, my great-grandfather was once bitten by a rattlesnake. After three days of intense pain -- the snake died.
 TROI / You're a very entertaining patient.
 RIKER / I try.
 TROI / Yes. You're making quite an effort to be cheerful.
 RIKER / You of all people should know...
 TROI / You feel what anyone in your place would feel.
 RIKER / But I'm the first officer of this ship. I have to set an example.
 TROI / Even now?
 RIKER / Now most of all. Deanna, facing death is the ultimate test of character. I don't want to die -- but if I have to, I want to do it with a little pride.
 TROI / And a lot of impudence.
 RIKER / (smiles) You bet. Dying is bad enough -- but losing my sense of humor? Forget it.
 TROI / Imzadi...
 RIKER / I haven't given up yet. The best medical team in Starfleet is on the case... I'm sure they'll...
 RIKER / Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf?!
 RIKER / Anybody?!
 TROI / (under her breath) Hang on, Will...
 TROI / Why won't they stabilize?
 TROI / Is the stimulation preventing the infection from taking hold?
 TROI / He's dreaming.
 RIKER / (snaps; interrupting) I do.
 RIKER / Hello!
 DATA / Marvelous how easily humans do that, sir. I still need much practice.
 RIKER / There are some puzzles down on the planet that Captain Picard wants answered. He suggests I take you on the away team I'll be leading.
 DATA / I shall endeavor to function adequately, sir.
 RIKER / Uh, yes. And when the captain suggested you I, uh, looked up your record... (hesitates)
 DATA / Yes sir, a wise procedure always.
 RIKER / Then, your rank of lieutenant commander is honorary.
 DATA / No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78; honors in probability mechanics and exobiology.
 RIKER / But your files... they say you're a...
 DATA / (waits; then) Machine? Correct, sir. Does that trouble you?
 RIKER / (hesitates) To be honest... yes, a little.
 DATA / Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human.
 RIKER / Now that troubles me. Do you consider yourself superior to us?
 DATA / I am superior in many ways. But I would gladly give it up to be human.
 RIKER / (studies Data; then) Nice to meet you, Pinocchio.
 RIKER / (continuing; explains) A joke.
 DATA / (straight-faced) Ah! Intriguing.
 RIKER / (big grin) You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data.
 RIKER / All stations have reported, Captain. There seems to be no immediate threat to our ship or crew.
 PICARD / In which case, let's hold position for a while, Number One. This is worth studying.
 RIKER / Incredible. It's like looking off into... infinity, sir. (turns to Picard) Remember the course in ancient history at Starfleet Academy? Back to the time when men still believed the Earth was flat?
 PICARD / (smiles) And that the sun revolved around the Earth...
 RIKER / And if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean it would fall off the edge of the world...
 PICARD / "Beyond this place there be dragons... " It was even said that crews would threaten to hang their captain from the yardarm if they refused to turn back.
 RIKER / I'm sure no one here has that in mind, sir.
 PICARD / How comforting, Number One.
 WESLEY / But what do I say? How should I act? What do I do?
 RIKER / Guinan, I need your help. Could you sit over there?
 RIKER / (to Wesley) The first words out of your mouth are the most important. You could start by saying something like... (turns to Guinan) ... "you're the most beautiful woman in the galaxy."
 RIKER / (continuing) But that might not work.
 RIKER / If you only knew how much I wanted to tell you that.
 RIKER / Yes.
 RIKER / Of us. Of what we could become...
 WESLEY / Commander Riker...
 RIKER / ... and that you might have thought it was a line.
 RIKER / Then you think I'm not sincere?
 RIKER / Then you're inviting me in?
 RIKER / That's more than I expected.
 RIKER / To hope is to recognize the possibility. I had only dreams.
 RIKER / Not these dreams.
 RIKER / (continuing) I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars... And all the universe worships night.
 RIKER / Then I'll learn to fly. You are the heart in my day and the soul in my night.
 WESLEY / I don't think this is my style.
 TROI / He's relaxed... experiencing feelings of warmth. Friendship.
 TROI / Will that intensify the commander's memories?
 RIVAN /  / Everyone! We've brought the visitors!
 LIATOR / (gesturing to away team) Please enjoy what we have!
 EDO MARBLE PLAYER / This will please you. Join us!
 RIKER / (grins; shakes head) Another time. Thanks.
 EDO SPECTATOR / Joy and happiness!
 RIKER / Certainly is.
 RIKER / The good life, Worf.
 WORF / I am not concerned with pleasure, Commander. I am a warrior.
 RIKER / Even Klingons must need love now and then.
 WORF / For what we consider love, sir, I would need a Klingon woman.
 RIKER / (eyes Worf curiously) How about plain old basic sex? You must have some need for that.
 WORF / Of course. But with the females who are available to me... Earth females... I must restrain myself too much. They are quite fragile, sir.
 RIKER / (eyes him again) Worf, if anyone else said that, I'd suspect he was bragging.
 WORF / (puzzled) "Bragging," sir?
 RIKER / (to the Bynars) Gentlemen, if this is what you call "enhancement" you have a gift for understatement.
 RIKER / What's your name, and tell me you love jazz.
 MINUET / My name is Minuet. I love all jazz except Dixieland.
 RIKER / Why not Dixieland?
 MINUET / Because you can't dance to it.
 RIKER / My girl.
 RIKER / (slyly) What's a knockout like you doing in a computer-generated joint like this?
 MINUET / Waiting for you.
 RIKER / Waiting for me?!! You can't be serious?
 MINUET / Oh yes, Will -- I've never been more serious in my life.
 RIKER / I am going to have to leave you for a while and see to my duties.
 MINUET / Your work is very important to you.
 RIKER / It is me -- it's what I am.
 MINUET / Can we dance once before you leave?
 RIKER / Sure, why not.
 RIKER / How did you learn to dance so well?
 MINUET / From following you.
 MINUET / I can anticipate your lead. Tell me more about your work -- what is it about it that consumes and enthralls you?
 RIKER / What an interesting choice of words. That's exactly what it does.
 MINUET / You are very fortunate.
 RIKER / I know that.
 MINUET / At this point in your life to be exactly where you want to be... And it's wonderful that you realize it.
 RIKER / I'd be a fool not to know how lucky I am to be on this ship serving with this group of people. It's a dream come true.
 RIKER / (continuing) Just like this.
 MINUET / A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what I am?
 RIKER / I know you are a computer-generated image... but your smell, the way you feel, your touch, even the way you talk and think is so real.
 MINUET / Thank you.
 RIKER / How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you?
 MINUET / As real as you need me to be.
 TROI / No... it's just that... Commander Riker's emotions are rather... passionate.
 TROI / (nods) Very much so.
 RIKER / What do you mean?
 RIKER / Of course I like... Oh... is there a technique to this foot washing?
 RIKER / I think I can handle that.
 BEATA / I like the way your eyes pick up the color of your tunic.
 RIKER / It's not our place to interfere in the domestic affairs of other societies.
 BEATA / But you can interact, can't you?
 RIKER / Of course. Otherwise, how can we learn?
 BEATA / And that's why you're here, tonight, with me... to learn?
 RIKER / Yes.
 BEATA / ... About our society.
 RIKER / Yes.
 BEATA / In our society, it's men who are the fortunate ones, enjoying all that life has to offer, while we women devote ourselves to the obligations of making life work.
 RIKER / In our society we share the responsibilities and the pleasures equally.
 BEATA / Don't be defensive. I'd be the last to imply that men are inferior.
 RIKER / Or I, that women are. That's why I can be here with you while the women on the away team go to find Ramsey.
 BEATA / I must remember to thank them when they return for giving us this time.
 BEATA / You resist... Why? Do you not find me attractive?
 RIKER / Oh... Yes I find you very attractive.
 BEATA / Don't you feel you know me well enough?
 BEATA / You attract me like no man ever has.
 RIKER / I'm flattered. I don't know what to say.
 TROI / Then all we've done is make things worse...
 TROI / Or the emotions they produce.
 TROI / And if some types of endorphins attract them...
 RIKER / I am Commander William Riker of the USS Enterprise.
 ARMUS / I am ARMUS. You are in my space.
 RIKER / We mean you no harm. We have an injured crew in that shuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass?
 ARMUS / You haven't given me a good enough reason yet.
 RIKER / Preserving life -- all life -- is very important to us.
 ARMUS / Why?
 RIKER / We believe that everything in the Universe has a right to exist.
 ARMUS / An interesting notion which I do not share. You may now leave if you wish.
 TASHA / We won't go without the shuttle crew.
 ARMUS / I warn you. You will not like it here.
 TASHA / What are you saying -- that you are going to deny us access to our comrades?
 ARMUS / I told you what you can do. You can leave. I have no interest in any further discussion or argument.
 TASHA / Enough. We have people who need attention. We will not harm you, but we must help them.
 ARMUS FLICKS HIS FINGER, sending an ENERGY FORCE / towards Tasha, JERKING HER BACK and SLAMMING HER DOWN to the ground.
 BEVERLY / She's dead.
 PICARD / Status, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Unchanged.
 PICARD / Can you bring her back?
 BEVERLY / I'm trying.
 RIKER / (hopeful) You've saved people before. You can save her.
 BEVERLY / Neural stimulator.
 RIKER / There. You did it.
 BEVERLY / No. I've got her on total support. There's no independent brain activity.
 BEVERLY / No! Inject norep.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We're going for direct reticular stimulation.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Doesn't matter! Do it!
 BEVERLY / Increase to seventy microvolts.
 RIKER / (urgently) Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Eighty-five microvolts.
 BEVERLY / She's gone.
 PICARD / Gone?
 BEVERLY / There's too much synaptic damage. That thing just sucked all the life out of her. There's nothing I can do...
 DATA / This way.
 BEVERLY / You are going to be all right, now.
 RIKER / Where are the others?
 WOMAN / Gone. It's just us.
 GEORDI / (urgent) Commander!
 GEORDI / There's someone there!
 BEVERLY / She's dead. If we'd only gotten here a little sooner... !
 DATA / Sir, if you indeed have "Q"'s power...
 BEVERLY / (to Riker) I don't understand. Certainly you can't bring her back to life?
 RIKER / (long beat) I'm prevented from that by a promise.
 TROI / It's Ian. Please... please hurry.
 TROI / (continuing) Save him, you must save him.
 TROI / No.
 DATA / The child is the source of the unusual radiation.
 TROI / He said he's the reason the ship is in danger.
 DATA / That analysis is correct.
 TROI / Oh, please. Please save him.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / (excited -- relieved) Captain. The containment field has stabilized.
 PICARD / Thank you, Lieutenant.
 TROI / Then Ian was right. He was the cause.
 PICARD / Apparently so.
 TROI / He is a life-force entity... as we passed each other in space he was curious and wanted to know about us, and he thought the best way to learn was to go through the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that way to understand us.
 TROI / (continuing) Captain, he never meant any harm.
 RIKER / There was a moment when you smiled.
 TROI / (she smiles again) He said thank you. (she pauses) I told him we will miss him -- and I will.
 TROI / Sadness.
 TROI / Then your theory is correct. The organisms are sensitive to different types of endorphins.
 TROI / Such as sadness...
 TROI / Then we've found a way to repel the infection.
 TROI / How much time do we have?
 RIKER / I am Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
 RIKER / (beat) I don't understand.
 RIKER / I have no such intentions, Captain.
 RIKER / I'm afraid I still don't understand.
 RIKER / I have been assigned here to serve this ship and to obey your orders. I will do exactly that.
 RIKER / (meets his gaze) I just did.
 RIKER / Was there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant?
 RIKER / Then I take it you challenge my authority over you.
 RIKER / (to Kargan) And your position in this, Captain?
 RIKER / My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is how to obey my orders. (beat) Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner over that of lieutenant?
 RIKER / Agreed, Captain Kargan.
 RIKER / Ready for your tour, Admiral?
 QUINN / Quite ready, Commander.
 RIKER / What's in the case?
 QUINN / (thoughtful) Actually... I brought this for Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd like you to see it first?
 RIKER / (slowly moving closer) What is it?
 QUINN / A form of life. Discovered quite accidentally by a survey team on a distant uncharted planet.
 RIKER / Why haven't we heard anything about that?
 QUINN / Oh, you'll be hearing more about it shortly. But first there is much scientific study to be done. After all, this is a superior life-form.
 RIKER / Superior?
 QUINN / Totally. (voice grows hard) Now come, Riker. Take a good look.
 RIKER / I think I'll summon our science officer --
 QUINN / It won't like your science officer. It likes you. (rises, grabs Riker's arm) Now look!
 QUINN / (dark smile) Vitamins. They do wonders for the body.
 RIKER CRIES OUT -- it feels like Quinn is crushing his / arm. Unable to break free, HE RAISES HIS OTHER ARM TO STRIKE the admiral. Riker's BLOW IS BLOCKED and QUINN responds by effortlessly THROWING HIM backwards toward the wall. The FIRST OFFICER hits it at breakneck speed and CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR, severely dazed...
 QUINN / (dry -- evil smile) Ahh, your life is so painful now. But soon you'll be one of us.
 RIKER / (pained, weak) Riker to security. Emergency --
 QUINN'S final blow KNOCKS RIKER OUT before he can say / another word...
 ARMUS HAS MOVED OFF THE SHUTTLE AND as it APPROACHES / THE GROUP, Riker suddenly feels a great force pull him. He calls out. Data MOVES to help him.
 ARMUS / (as slime) Touch him and he dies.
 For a beat there is nothing. Then: WE CAN SEE only RIKER'S FACE PRESSED AGAINST THE SKIN. / 
 DATA / Enterprise, ARMUS has enveloped Commander Riker.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I'm beaming you up!
 ARMUS / If any of you leave now, he dies. And so do the survivors of the crash.
 TROI / But we've isolated the specific areas to stimulate. The feelings were very primal... survival emotions.
 TROI / Can you intensify those emotions?
 TROI / Do we have a choice?
 TROI / He's getting weaker, isn't he?
 T'JON / Take us to our planet -- leave us there with our medicine or this person dies.
 T'JON / (continuing) Don't you see -- I have no choice. We were sent to bring back the Felicium. The suffering on my planet is too great. People are dying. It doesn't matter any more whether we are entitled to the Felicium... we have to have it.
 PICARD / Let him go.
 T'JON / Take us there now -- or give us a shuttle -- but we must have the medicine... if you refuse, this person dies.
 PICARD / I will not be coerced.
 T'JON / I'll do it. I'll kill him.
 PICARD / (calmly) No you won't. You're not a killer.
 RIKER / You haven't used my first name once, Paul.
 RIKER / (continuing) You remember it, don't you?
 RIKER / (continuing) You don't, because you don't even exist. You're a fake -- an image of the original! Aren't you?... Answer me!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Report, Number One.
 RIKER / The image of Rice has been replaced by something which is hovering several meters away.
 RIKER / Prepare to beam up.
 TASHA / Commander.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (tense, tight) What just happened down there? Number One! Report!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Report! Report!
 TASHA / He can't answer you, Captain.
 DATA / Commander Riker has been encased in some kind of energy field.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Is he alive?
 DATA / Unknown.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Who are you?
 TROI / Can we tighten the pattern further?
 PICARD / Set auto-destruct sequence.
 RIKER / ... Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence -- now!
 PICARD / Let's go. The only place we can stop the count is from the bridge.
 DATA / Captain, we are clear of the void. You may stop the auto-destruct.
 PICARD / Data, on any heading -- warp six -- now!
 RIKER / Captain.
 PICARD / I don't believe it, Number One. It could still be part of the illusion. Data, report.
 DATA / All navigational systems confirm -- we are at warp six -- on course...
 WORF / Firing sequence proceeding, sir.
 RIKER / Hold fast.
 KORRIS / I am Korris.
 RIKER / We'll handle the formalities later -- right now we have to get off this ship. Are there any others still alive?
 KORRIS / No.
 DATA / I believe there is a quicker way out of here.
 GEORDI / Let's go.
 RIKER / Check him Data.
 DATA / He is alive -- but just barely.
 RIKER / Pick him up and let's get out of here.
 KORRIS / No. I will carry him.
 DATA / As you wish.
 GEORDI / We're out of time, Commander -- the ship's going to blow.
 RIKER / Transporter Room, have you got a lock on us?
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Not yet. Too much interference. You have to get farther away from the Engineering section.
 RIKER / End of the line. Transporter Room, we've gone as far as we can. Get us off -- now!
 RIKER'S VOICE / Ship's log, First Officer Riker. The star has begun disintegrating. Enterprise will be destroyed unless it can be moved out of the path of the star material hurtling...
 RIKER'S VOICE / (continuing) ... toward us. Our only hope is for Lieutenant Commander Data in the time we have left, to regain his senses and reconnect engine power to the bridge.
 WESLEY / Hi, Mister Data.
 DATA / Nice to see you, Wesley. What... ?
 RIKER / (overlapping; urgently indicating) Data! We need the engines on-line in a hurry, remember?
 WESLEY / Oh yes, I remember too. (to Data) So, Data, if you don't mind...
 RIKER / (fast; to Wesley) We've no time for courtesy! (fast; to Data) Get those damned control chips back in place, Data! In the correct order!
 RIKER / (continuing) NOW!
 WESLEY / (to Data) It's like a game of "how fast can you do it?"
 DATA / Ah, a game!
 WESLEY / I think I can switch this to the Main Viewer, sir...
 RIKER / We've got eight or nine minutes, at most, Data. Can you finish by then?
 DATA / No. This will take slightly more time than we have, sir.
 RIKER / Dammit, NO! I can't afford to get it!
 DATA / If we had just a minute more, sir...
 RIKER / We didn't make it, Captain. If we had just a minute or so more...
 WESLEY / Yes, then reversing power leads, back through the force activator... repulser beam hard against the Tsiolkovsky...
 RIKER / We're pushing away!
 RIKER / (continuing; into communicator) Bridge, engage engines!
 TROI / (optimistic) The growth rate's almost zero.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Doctor.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I'm on my way.
 RIKER / You still here?
 TROI / (relieved) I could ask you the same question.
 RIKER / Beat. You wouldn't believe the dreams I've been having...
 TROI / Yes, we would.
 RIKER / Great work, Doctor.
 RIKER (cont'd) / Now, if you'll let me get out of here and back to work...
 RIKER / Why? I feel fine.
 RIKER / Of course I know who I am. I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / Delighted you're feeling better, Captain. (re: Data) The admiral and I were worried about you.
 DATA / Sir, I do not believe you have the authority to promote me to the rank of admiral.
 DATA / Captain, Doctor, I am honored by your presence, but may I suggest you attend the second concert.
 BEVERLY / Why, Data?
 DATA / Ensign Ortiz will perform the violin part. My rendition will be less enjoyable.
 PICARD / Oh?
 DATA / While I am quite proficient Technically, according to my fellow performers, I lack soul.
 BEVERLY / Data, telling us why you're going to fail before you make the attempt is never wise.
 DATA / But is not honesty always the preferred choice?
 PICARD / Excessive honesty can be disastrous... particularly in a commander.
 DATA / (very intrigued) Indeed?
 PICARD / Knowing your limitations is one thing. Advertising them to a crew can damage your ability to lead.
 DATA / Because you lose their respect?
 BEVERLY / No, because you may begin to believe in those limitations yourself.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, we're receiving a message from the Sheliak Corporate.
 WORF / Origin point of the message confirmed. It is from the Shelia star system.
 RIKER / The Sheliak have not attempted to communicate with the Federation for a hundred and eleven years.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / What the devil --
 PICARD / Cancel message.
 RIKER / Tau Cygna Five is in the de Laure belt -- heavy concentrations of hyperonic radiation.
 PICARD / Humans can't survive in such an environment. Exposure to hyperonic radiation is fatal.
 RIKER / Then the Sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts.
 PICARD / No, Number One. The Sheliak haven't broken a century of silence to send us after phantoms. An investigation is in order. Set course for Tau Cygna Five.
 WORF / Human life form readings from the planet.
 RIKER / So, the Sheliak weren't hallucinating.
 PICARD / Numbers?
 WORF / Impossible to get an accurate reading, Captain. The high radiation levels are disrupting our sensors.
 DATA / Hyperonic radiation also interferes with ship's transporters; they are now inoperable.
 WORF / So are the ship's phasers.
 RIKER / How can humans survive down there?
 BEVERLY / They must have found a way to adapt. (thinks it over) Milan's work in radiation sensitivity suggests it's possible. Perhaps with extensive virotherapy... (grimly) Until they found the answer, their mortality rate must have been staggering.
 PICARD / Well, whoever they are and however they've survived, we've got to get them off the planet.
 RIKER / By treaty, this world does belong to the Sheliak...
 PICARD / ... who are within their rights to demand the removal of these "trespassers."
 RIKER / And if we don't remove them, the Sheliak will.
 BEVERLY / How forcefully?
 RIKER / To the Sheliak, humans are a lower life form. They'd have no compunctions about exterminating the intruders.
 PICARD / Mister Data. As you are unaffected by hyperonic radiation, you will go to the planet via shuttlecraft and commence evacuation procedures.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Any speculation as to what he'll find, Number One?
 RIKER / A lost survey ship would be my guess. A dozen or so survivors at most.
 DATA / Hello.
 DATA / That is correct. I am an android. I am Lieutenant Commander Data of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 DATA / Excellent.
 DATA / And who, precisely, is "we?"
 RIKER / Got it. The Artemis, launched one hundred forty-two years ago, destination Septimis Minor. When they failed to check in, Starfleet began an extensive search.
 PICARD / What carried the Artemis so far off course?
 DATA / My local informant does not know. In the early days survival on Tau Cygna Five was more important than history.
 PICARD / Understood. How many are there?
 DATA / Approximately fifteen thousand.
 RIKER / (to Picard) We've only got three days. Without working transporters, we couldn't have them out in time.
 PICARD / Shuttles?
 WORF / Loading all the Enterprise shuttlecraft to capacity -- evacuation would take four weeks, four days.
 PICARD / Then we need more time. Mister Data, prepare the colonists for an evacuation.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister Worf, get me the Sheliak.
 WORF / Their home world is quite distant, Captain. This will take some time.
 DATA / Lieutenant Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise.
 DATA / My mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation.
 DATA / Because this planet belongs to the Sheliak.
 DATA / The term is plural. The Sheliak are an intelligent, non-humanoid life form, classification R-3 --
 DATA / But the original destination of the Artemis was Septimis Minor.
 DATA / Your accomplishments are indeed remarkable. However, the Sheliak and the Federation have a treaty that clearly makes this planet Sheliak domain.
 DATA / That may not be possible. The Sheliak wish to colonize this planet, and they are unwilling to share it with humans. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / If you are still here when the Sheliak colony ship arrives, they will eradicate you.
 DATA / They have little regard for human life. Thus, our most sensible course is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your people.
 DATA / Perhaps I have not made myself clear.
 DATA / Have you seen many?
 DATA / No -- they are positronic.
 DATA / I am afraid I have no time to answer one million questions. I have a mission to accomplish. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / I need to know more about your people, and Gosheven seems unwilling to talk to me further.
 RIKER / Gentlemen, we're giving you an assignment, and the one thing we don't want to hear is that it is impossible.
 PICARD / I need the transporters to function despite the hyperonic radiation.
 GEORDI / Impossi -- Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Even if we can get the Sheliak to talk to us, they're not likely to be accommodating.
 TROI / Captain, when the treaty was negotiated the Federation sent three hundred and seventy-two legal experts. What have we got?
 PICARD / Thee... and me.
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / Try again. Boost signal strength.
 WORF / Sheliak Corporate. This is the Starship Enterprise. Respond please.
 PICARD / Conversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to our mutual problem.
 PICARD / Both parties are involved, sir.
 TROI / Their culture is extremely formal, almost ritualistic. An apology might smooth matters.
 PICARD / I apologize for our inadvertent violation of the treaty.
 PICARD / Let us negotiate in good faith...
 PICARD / There is a thriving colony on the planet. Rather than uproot these people may I offer a compromise?
 PICARD / Why?!
 PICARD / This is not a law. It is a treaty. It is designed to smooth relations between peoples. Not to act as a strait...
 PICARD / ... jacket.
 DATA / The possibility exists, and Gosheven appears unwilling to prepare for it. Why?
 DATA / I am not ordering him to do anything; I am merely trying to persuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate. (thinks) Do you believe my suggested course of action should be followed?
 DATA / In spite of the fact that I am an android?
 DATA / No, I would say not.
 DATA / You conclude from this that I am impartial... hence you accept my recommendations.
 DATA (cont'd) / Yet Gosheven does not. (thinks) Perhaps he might reconsider his position if someone other than myself were to present the arguments.
 DATA / Data, here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / The Sheliak won't bargain.
 DATA / Understood.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I'm contacting Starfleet to arrange for transport. Get those people prepared for evacuation. We may have to move very quickly.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / We must speak with Gosheven immediately.
 RIKER / Gentlemen, how are you coming? (spots the object) What the hell is that?
 GEORDI / Our first attempt.
 WESLEY / But we've got plenty of things left to try.
 GEORDI / There's some really interesting residue . . . reminds me of -- (a beat) There's that damn pulsar in the neighborhood.
 WESLEY / Teremi-thorons.
 WESLEY / They're one of the most elusive sub-atomic particles known, and they really shred a transporter signal.
 RIKER / Thank you, Ensign, I passed physics. (to Geordi) Keep at it. We need those transporters.
 GEORDI / We're going to have a lot of fun cracking this one.
 DATA / It is water, a substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen --
 DATA / The Sheliak will not accept humans on their planet. And they will not hesitate to use force to remove you.
 DATA / You cannot win.
 DATA / Are his sentiments typical among the colonists?
 DATA / (nods) I see no other course of action. If I can convince enough people of the necessity of leaving --
 DATA / You are offering assistance?
 RIKER / Yes, sir?
 PICARD / Three weeks. Starfleet is profuse in their apologies, but it will still be three weeks.
 RIKER / Until?
 PICARD / Until the arrival of a colony transport ship equipped with dedicated personnel shuttles.
 RIKER / We can't wait three weeks.
 PICARD / The Sheliak must agree to extend our deadline.
 PICARD (cont'd) / If they plan to settle Tau Cygna Five two days from now...
 RIKER / ... one of their ships must already be en route.
 PICARD / (decides) We're going to intercept that ship.
 RIKER / The Sheliak may interpret that as a hostile act.
 PICARD / We have to take the risk.
 RIKER / The Enterprise is going to try to intercept the Sheliak colony ship. Your job ... well, you know your job.
 DATA / Commander, in human parlance, I do not believe I can "get the job done." My training has prepared me for starship command duties. As a cultural contact I am proving to be less than exemplary.
 RIKER / What's the situation?
 DATA / Their leader has rejected my counsel. He denies the logic of my arguments and talks of structures they have built.
 RIKER / Then try something else.
 DATA / I have. In the last three hours and eight minutes, I have spoken to fifty-six colonists. Ten refused to believe a threat exists. Twenty-two favored staying and fighting the Sheliak.
 RIKER / (more to himself) I don't have time for this.
 DATA / Sixteen preferred negotiation or some form of passive resistance. Only eight were willing to consider evacuation. And of those eight --
 RIKER / (cutting him) Data, I can't help you -- I don't know these people; I haven't talked to them. You have. Use that fancy positronic brain of yours -- and carry out your mission.
 DATA / If I do not succeed, how violent is the Sheliak reaction likely to be?
 RIKER / The treaty is the only thing which kept them from eradicating the colony the moment they discovered it.
 DATA / Ah.
 RIKER / "Ah" is right. The lives of fifteen thousand people are riding on you. You'd better get innovative. Riker out.
 DATA / Is there any indication that Gosheven has changed his position?
 DATA / First, will Gosheven allow me to speak? Second, even if he does, what good will it do? So far, my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective.
 DATA (cont'd) / Why did you do that?
 DATA / Among humans, a kiss normally serves to seal a friendship or to indicate support, attraction, affection.
 DATA (cont'd) / In this context, I would assume your intention was to express support.
 DATA / That is something of an understatement.
 DATA / Thus far, that quality has not helped me accomplish my mission.
 DATA / (accessing) Elicit a desired behavior by advocating its opposite? (a beat) That implies deception, does it not?
 DATA / (considers) Perhaps this is a situation in which excessive honesty is detrimental.
 PICARD / (you will get it done) How are we progressing, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / (it's impossible) About like you'd expect.
 PICARD / (get it done) Splendid.
 WESLEY / (wearily) He wants the impossible.
 GEORDI / (with a grin) That's the short definition for "captain."
 DATA / I wish to speak.
 DATA / (loud, for the crowd's benefit) You deny me the opportunity to address the assemblage?
 DATA / Do you consider your position so weak that it cannot withstand debate?
 DATA / You know of the Sheliak threat. Starfleet wishes to evacuate you for your own protection. Gosheven has decided otherwise. That is his right. And I will not waste time trying to reverse that decision.
 DATA (cont'd) / I admire your conviction in the face of certain defeat. Your effort will be valiant, though doomed. Still, when you die, you will die for land and honor.
 DATA / Your children will understand that they are dying for a worthy cause.
 DATA / (continuing) Long after the battle is over, their courage will be remembered and extolled.
 DATA / (as if he hadn't considered that) Ah, that is true. There will be no one left alive to remember.
 DATA / I was simply attempting to describe your inevitable destruction in a manner that would have an emotional effect.
 DATA / (almost to himself) Then here you die.
 WESLEY / Maybe if we bypassed the autosequence and decompiled the pattern buffer... ?
 GEORDI / (shrugs) It's no crazier than anything else we've tried.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 WESLEY / Sorry, sir.
 DATA / And you, Kentor?
 TROI / In our dealings with other non-humanoid races there has been some point of reference; not so with the Sheliak.
 PICARD / We must have something in common. We communicate.
 TROI / Barely. The Sheliak have learned several Federation languages, but theirs continues to elude us.
 PICARD / (have we tried?) Telepaths?
 TROI / Attempted and failed.
 PICARD / This is ludicrous!
 TROI / No, sir, the fact that any alien race communicates with another is quite remarkable.
 TROI / (continuing) We are stranded on a planet. No language in common, but I want to teach you mine.
 TROI / (continuing) S'smarith. What did I just say?
 PICARD / Cup? Glass?
 TROI / Are you sure? I might have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. And we conceptualize the universe in relatively the same way.
 PICARD / Point taken.
 TROI / During your talks you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is 500,000 words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. They consider our language irrational, and demanded this level of complexity to avoid any future misunderstandings.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak colonists on visual.
 PICARD / On my way. (to Troi) So it begins.
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / We desire face-to-face negotiation to settle the crisis on Tau Cygna Five.
 PICARD / (continuing) We are entitled to consultation under paragraph five hundred and sixty-three subparagraph nine.
 RIKER / Was that an invitation?
 PICARD / I'm going to take it as such. Number One, you have the bridge.
 RIKER / Helm, maintain relative position. Mister Worf, have Transporter Room Two stand by.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 DATA / If you so desire.
 DATA / The Federation will offer as little or as much help as you dictate.
 DATA / Apparently, that is not correct.
 DATA / I appear to be reversing that defeat.
 PICARD / Director, we will comply with your request to remove the colony on Tau Cygna Five, but we need time.
 TROI / The temporary presence of these humans should not interfere with your plans.
 PICARD / I'm trying! But the needed ship won't be available for three weeks.
 PICARD / I have admitted that! I'm only asking for a little tolerance.
 PICARD / We will remove them. But you must grant us the time we require.
 PICARD / (outraged) They are not vermin! They are citizens of the Federation and I will not permit this travesty!
 PICARD / Between intelligent species of good will --
 RIKER / I take it the Sheliak just hung up on us. Again.
 DATA / I am equipped with diagnostic circuits and can correct many malfunctions.
 DATA / Perhaps that has been part of our difficulty. Words are all we have been using. (thinking) Humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions.
 DATA (cont'd) / I require a phaser.
 DATA / A type of weapon. Unfortunately it will not function in the presence of hyperonic radiation.
 DATA (cont'd) / I will have to be innovative.
 DATA / Hyperonic radiation randomizes phaser beams. But I believe I can improvise a servocircuit which will compensate by continuously recollimating the output.
 DATA / Essentially correct.
 DATA (cont'd) / Get word to Gosheven. Tell him I am coming to the pumping station. Tell him I am going to destroy the aqueduct.
 DATA / I sincerely hope so.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Go to Yellow Alert. Shields up.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Riker, put us nose to nose with the Sheliak ship. If she makes a move, match it.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Open a hailing frequency.
 WORF / They're not responding, sir.
 PICARD / (tight control) They don't have to answer. They just have to listen! Sheliak vessel, you will have to go through me to get at the colony on Tau Cygna Five!
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / Close channel -- and get me that treaty! They've been beating us over the head with it for three days. Let's see if we can't find something in it that can be turned to our advantage.
 RIKER / We're going to try to beat them at their own game?
 WORF / The treaty is how long?
 TROI / Five hundred thousand words.
 WORF / (glumly) We are going to regret Data's absence.
 DATA / That was the "stun" setting.
 DATA (cont'd) / This is not.
 DATA (cont'd) / I could reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris... but I trust my point is clear. I am one android with a single weapon. There are hundreds of Sheliak on the way... and their weapons are far more powerful.
 DATA (cont'd) / And the Sheliak may not even offer you a target. They can obliterate this colony from orbit. You will die never having seen the faces of your killers.
 DATA (cont'd) / The choice is yours.
 DATA / I know that, but it is just a thing, and things can be replaced. Lives cannot. Live, rebuild and be remembered.
 WORF / This is hopeless. Fighting would be preferable.
 PICARD / That's it.
 TROI / I don't follow you, sir.
 PICARD / Worf, get me the Sheliak.
 WORF / (just heard the reprieve) Yes, sir!
 PICARD / Pursuant to paragraph one thousand two hundred and ninety I formally request third party arbitration of our dispute.
 PICARD / And further, pursuant to subsection D, three, I name the Grizzelas to arbitrate.
 RIKER / (mouths) Grizzelas?
 PICARD / Unfortunately they are currently in their hibernation cycle, but they'll awaken in six months, and then we'll get this matter settled. Now, do you want to wait... or give me my three weeks?
 PICARD / Then I declare the treaty in abeyance!
 RIKER / (smiling) You enjoyed that.
 PICARD / You're damn right.
 WORF / Captain, they are hailing us.
 WORF / (continuing) Sir?
 PICARD / (a beat) On screen.
 PICARD / (with careful enunciation) Thank you.
 GEORDI / Captain, we can do it! We can modify the transporters.
 PICARD / Excellent.
 GEORDI / It'll take fifteen years, and a research team of a hundred --
 PICARD / (dryly) Mister La Forge, I believe we will postpone.
 GEORDI / (with a grin) Yes, sir.
 DATA / Commander Data to Enterprise. I am preparing to leave Tau Cygna Five and await rendezvous instructions.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged. Stand by.
 DATA / Hello, Ard'rian.
 DATA / I would not have succeeded without your support and insight, and I appreciate your assistance.
 DATA / I am incapable of forgetting. I will remember every detail of my visit with perfect clarity.
 DATA / I do not understand.
 DATA / I have no feelings of any kind.
 DATA / You appeared to require it.
 DATA / Have I disappointed you?
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / But I am the only android you have ever met.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Welcome home, Mister Data. Well done.
 DATA / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / The good doctor was kind enough to provide me with a recording of your concert. Your performance shows a good deal of feeling.
 DATA / As I have lately had to remind others, I have no feelings.
 PICARD / That's hard to believe; your playing is quite beautiful.
 DATA / Strictly speaking, it is not "my" playing. It is a precise imitation of the techniques of Jascha Heifetz and Trenka Bron-Ken.
 PICARD / And is there nothing of Data in what I'm hearing?
 PICARD (cont'd) / You chose the violinists. Heifetz and Bron-Ken had radically different styles, but you combined them -- successfully.
 DATA / I suppose I have learned to be innovative... when necessary, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data... I look forward to your next concert.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker to Ensign Crusher.
 WESLEY / (hoarse) Go ahead....
 RIKER / Forget to set your alarm, Wesley?
 WESLEY / Uh, yessir. I'm... very sorry. I'll be right there.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I didn't think you'd want to miss this.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43102.8. We have entered a spectacular double star system in the Kavis Alpha sector on a most critical mission of astro-physical research.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Our eminent guest, Doctor Paul Stubbs, will attempt to study the decay of globules of neutronium expelled at relativistic speeds by a massive stellar explosion which will occur here in a matter of hours.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) It is virtually a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as dictated by the forces of nature. But frankly, Doctor Stubbs seems much calmer about it all than those of us who are simply charged with the responsibility of delivery and observation.
 RIKER / Ensign, our position....
 WESLEY / Approaching ten million kilometers from the neutron star...
 RIKER / Slow to one third impulse power...
 WESLEY / Yessir.
 DATA / Eighteen hours, seven minutes, and ... ten seconds, Doctor.
 PICARD ENTERS from the Ready Room. / 
 PICARD / Doctor Stubbs, if you want to make a final inspection of the unit...
 PICARD / Begin launch sequence.
 RIKER / Shuttle Bay Two, stand-by to launch the uh, "egg"...
 WESLEY / One billionth of a second.
 WESLEY / When I heard we were going to be part of your experiment, I read all your published works.
 RIKER / Begin pre-launch sequence.
 DATA / Five minutes to launch site.
 PICARD / Stabilize.
 WESLEY / The ship is not responding.
 GEORDI / Checking for failure of inertia dampeners... Instruments say they're working...
 WORF / Captain, we're heading straight into the path of that stellar matter....
 PICARD / Shields up.
 WORF / Negative. The shields won't respond.
 DATA / Impact thirty seconds.
 PICARD / Go to manual override to raise shields.
 WORF / Shields are rising.
 RIKER / Reset dampeners.
 GEORDI / Dampeners not responding. Unable to reset.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Reverse impulse engines.
 GEORDI / Initiating reverse sequence.
 DATA / Impact twenty seconds.
 PICARD / The momentum is still taking us into the path of the stellar matter.
 RIKER / Close the shuttle bay door... Prepare for impact.
 RIKER / Commander Data, check all systems... Medical personnel to the bridge.
 DATA / All systems functioning normally again.
 PICARD / Computer, explanation for control malfunction.
 WESLEY / They're running a check to find out what happened. Everything's okay now...
 ANNETTE / We're going into the Holodeck to ski in Switzerland, Wes... want to come?
 WESLEY / Oh... I can't... I have to check on Doctor Stubbs. He's in Sickbay...
 WESLEY / I can't, Eric. There's just too much to do...
 WESLEY / The captain asked me to tell you that our systems are back to normal and we can make another launch attempt as soon as you're ready.
 BEVERLY / (smiles at her son) It's nice to be back together. I was at Starfleet Medical for a year... I missed about two inches of him.
 BEVERLY / (poking) Does that hurt?
 WESLEY / I know.
 BEVERLY / Sure he does...
 WESLEY / (interrupting) My studies keep me pretty busy. I'm trying to get into the Academy... I earn credits for my work on the Enterprise... but it's not the same as being there...
 BEVERLY / Computer, fix the food slot...
 BEVERLY / Well, check it again...
 BEVERLY / Deactivate food slot.
 GEORDI / We're analyzing the engineering systems data, Captain... so far nothing unusual in the computer log for that time period...
 PICARD / Run a level one diagnostic series. We need a computer that's one hundred percent to run Doctor Stubbs' experiment.
 PICARD / (continuing) ... As well as the food slots in Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / It seems to be working again. For the moment anyway...
 PICARD / (sitting) What can I do for you, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, how would you feel if you were a seventeen year old and the only starship officer whose mother was on board... ?
 PICARD / If you're concerned about Wesley, I see no evidence that there's a problem.
 BEVERLY / I know. In a funny kind of way... that's exactly my point. We talk. We smile. It's almost too polite.
 PICARD / Beverly, this is simply a matter of time. I know how difficult it was to be away.
 BEVERLY / (vulnerable) Tell me about him.
 PICARD / He's... become a fine officer. He works as hard as any member of the crew... Riker says his studies...
 BEVERLY / No, tell me about him.
 PICARD / He seems well adjusted...
 BEVERLY / Does he have many friends... has he been in love... ?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Jean-Luc, he's come so far, so fast. And since I've been back I don't feel...
 PICARD / His dependence? (beat, as she considers) He is seventeen, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / What were you doing when you were seventeen?
 PICARD / Getting into a lot more trouble than Wesley is, I can assure you.
 BEVERLY / So was I.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Isn't that what seventeen is supposed to be?
 WESLEY / How can you be so calm about everything? If I was about to make this kind of breakthrough...
 WESLEY / It's German, isn't it?
 WESLEY / The burden?
 WESLEY / Red Alert. You should return to your quarters immediately.
 PICARD / (urgent) Still no visual contact? Impossible... Mister Worf, same magnification. Fifty degrees starboard.
 RIKER / Worf, you're absolutely sure...
 WORF (O.S.) / The sensors clearly indicate the approach of a Borg vessel.
 RIKER / Shields up.
 WORF / Shields are not responding.
 GEORDI / Manual overide is jammed. It's not gonna work this time... we don't have shields, Captain.
 WORF (O.S.) / Captain, they've fired energy weapons at us...
 PICARD / Evasive action.
 RIKER / Bring about to two-eight-five mark three.
 PICARD / Predict current vector of the Borg ship.
 WORF / Vector... is gone. (beat, reacts) And so is the Borg vessel.
 PICARD / You're telling me this was another computer glitch?
 DATA / It is conceivable that we were viewing a synthetically generated image... although there is no precedent for it.
 RIKER / (incredulous) Our computer was daydreaming... ?
 PICARD / Computer, identify malfunction immediately.
 DATA / Controls are not responding.
 GEORDI / Impulse engines are down.
 RIKER / Try warp engines.
 GEORDI / Sorry, Commander... I better get back to engineering...
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, you will accompany Commander La Forge. I want a full report on the prospects for getting our shields back. Commanders Data and Riker will join me in the conference room to consider the future of this mission... if there is one.
 PICARD / The fact of the matter is we're dealing with a potential breakdown of our main computer...
 RIKER / That's hard to accept.
 DATA / The system automatically provides for self-correction, Captain. There has not been a system-wide technological failure on a starship in seventy-nine years.
 TROI / Excuse me, Captain, Doctor Stubbs has been waiting to see you. I think it might be wise if...
 PICARD / Of course, Doctor. Sit down. (join us) Counselor...
 PICARD / (continuing) Commander La Forge is attempting repairs as we speak...
 PICARD / Doctor, if it is at all possible, we will continue this mission as planned.
 PICARD / (sharp) Nevertheless, my first and foremost concern will be to insure the safety of this ship and its crew...
 PICARD / My dear Doctor, in our current position, when that star explodes, you'll get to watch your experiment from the inside out.
 PICARD / I don't believe you speak for the majority, Doctor.
 TROI / Doctor Stubbs, I know how much this means to you...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard.
 WORF / Captain, all weapons systems are down.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Estimated time for repairs?
 GEORDI / Commander, I don't even know what to repair yet.
 PICARD / Continue to advise.
 TROI / His nonchalance is studied and practiced...
 PICARD / Even my sensory perception picked that up today...
 TROI / In fact, he's put his entire self-worth on the line with this experiment. He is telling the truth when he says he'd rather die than leave. (reactions) And one more thing... he doesn't like women very much.
 DATA / Odd. The research material on Doctor Stubbs includes not a few references from gossip columns. It suggests females find him quite attractive.
 TROI / Not this one.
 BEVERLY / What happened to you?
 ANNETTE / I was making a great run down a deserted slope when the ground just seemed to fall away....
 BEVERLY / Engineering, this is Doctor Crusher. The Holodecks are to be closed by my order until further notice.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We've been having control problems today. There's a small fracture here... this'll just take a minute...
 ANNETTE / (to Beverly) Wes almost came along. It's probably a good thing he didn't.
 BEVERLY / I didn't know he was going skiing with you...
 ANNETTE / We don't see much of him now that he's been assigned to the bridge.
 BEVERLY / Omigod....
 BEVERLY / He's not breathing...
 BEVERLY / If he had been alone, he would have died.
 PICARD / Advise everyone to remain in their quarters when not on duty. Protocol "B" access to all power components. Nobody else uses them unless it's cleared by Commander Riker.
 WORF / Sir, is it possible this is not a computer breakdown? (off Picard's look) What if it is some form of attack?
 RIKER / Our sensors showed no sign of life in this stellar system.
 PICARD / They also showed a Borg vessel that did not exist. Counselor Troi?
 TROI / I perceive no life force, Captain... no feelings of ill will. But I am not attuned to every form of life.
 PICARD / Data, stay on the sensors... see if we can't pick up something out there.
 RIKER / It does almost seem as if something... or someone is trying to render the Enterprise helpless.
 PICARD / They're not just trying, Number One. If it's true, they're doing a damn good job of it.
 WESLEY / You got it. Nice going, Geordi...
 GEORDI / Call up the cross-section of computer core processor four-five-one, elements zero-two-hundred through zero-three-hundred.
 GEORDI / (continuing) In order to get some power, I had to by-pass the computer core and essentially hotwire the connection.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Look at that lesion. No wonder we're coming apart at the seams.
 GEORDI / It's some kind of continuing disintegration. But from what... I can't tell ya. And I haven't the slightest idea how to stop it.
 WESLEY / But it's just a mechanical problem, right?
 GEORDI / Increase magnification, factor fifty.
 GEORDI / I don't know, Wesley. Looking at it... if it weren't... impossible... I'd say someone had climbed in there and started taking it apart.
 WESLEY / Guinan... I didn't think anyone would be here.
 WESLEY / I'm just setting... traps.
 WESLEY / I know. It's not that. I just...
 WESLEY / (continuing) Guinan, I'm scared. Everything that's been going wrong may be my fault.
 WESLEY / I've been working on my final project for Advanced Genetics. It's on nanotechnology. And I've been studying the nanites we have in the Sickbay genetic supplies. They're just like tiny little robots with gigabytes of mechanical computer memory, tiny enough to enter living cells and conduct repairs. They're supposed to be strictly confined to the lab.
 WESLEY / (sighs) Two of them. That's all. See, I just wanted to see how they would interact and function in tandem. In my project, I had proposed a theory that they could actually combine their skills to improve their usefulness. And it was working.
 WESLEY / I was pulling an all-nighter to get my final data... and I fell asleep. When I woke up, I realized the container was still open... (off her look) It was just a science project.
 WESLEY / They're really harmless. They only have the most basic skills. It's almost impossible that they could be responsible...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Doctor Crusher to Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / (reacts) Go ahead.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I stopped by your quarters, Wes. I assumed you'd be there, since you're off duty.
 WESLEY / I was just... I had some things to do...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Orders are orders, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / You won't tell anybody...
 WESLEY / I know. I will. If it's true.
 WESLEY / (glum) I always get an A.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Our computer core has clearly been tampered with and yet there is no sign of a breach of security on board.
 PICARD (V.O.) / We have even considered sabotage, but Counselor Troi has not detected any such sentiments. We have engines back and will attempt to complete our mission... but without a reliable computer, Doctor Stubbs' experiment is in serious jeopardy.
 RIKER / Manual restart sequence?
 GEORDI / Manual restart successful... impulse engine functions appear normal.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 RIKER / Shuttle Bay Two, open hangar doors.
 PICARD / What in heaven's name... ?
 DATA / It is "Stars and Stripes Forever" by John Phillip Sousa, a popular American composer of band music in the early twentieth century...
 PICARD / Yes... yes... I know...
 RIKER / Computer, shut off the music....
 DATA / The music is on all communications channels, Captain.
 RIKER / Power... weapons... communications. We're being stripped one system at a time...
 PICARD / Shut off the power to the bridge.
 TROI / I feel no hostile emotions present. No friendly feelings either. Nothing.
 WORF / Only an enemy without honor refuses to show himself in battle.
 PICARD / We may be fighting a different kind of enemy than we've ever known... an enemy that fights a war of nerves. (beat) Resume power to the bridge.
 PICARD / (continuing) Commander La Forge, can you get us out of this star system safely...
 RIKER / Not now, Doctor.
 GEORDI / I'll try, Captain. I don't want to overload the engines...
 PICARD / Do it gently. But do it.
 RIKER / We'll circuit in auxiliary power to the bridge... and find some way to silence Sousa if he tries an encore.
 PICARD / The priority is to find out who or what is doing this and why. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (Riker acknowledges, EXITS) Those of us not involved in that detail should get a few minutes rest. Commander Data, the bridge, or what's left of it, is yours.
 WESLEY / Nobody will say that...
 WESLEY / My dad taught it to me when I was little.
 WESLEY / Do you recreate them on a Holodeck?
 BEVERLY / We have to talk.
 BEVERLY / You really look like you could use some rest...
 WESLEY / I know. It's okay. Really.
 BEVERLY / (gentle) No, it's not. Really.
 WESLEY / I'm just checking some traps that I set... to see if I can find out what's happening to the ship.
 BEVERLY / On someone's orders... ?
 WESLEY / We're running out of time for Doctor Stubbs...
 BEVERLY / Wesley, you can't put everything on your own shoulders. Even when you're off duty, you're on duty...
 WESLEY / Mom, you don't understand...
 BEVERLY / You're a seventeen year old boy...
 WESLEY / I'm an acting officer... I have responsibilities....
 BEVERLY / (cautiously) I'm beginning to think... maybe we're all expecting too much of you.
 WESLEY / (reacts) I've done everything anyone has asked of me and more. You don't know... you haven't even been here.
 BEVERLY / I'm here now, Wesley.
 BEVERLY / C'mon, I'll help you finish this up... what are you looking for?
 BEVERLY / Wesley... ?
 WESLEY / Mom, I think I've made a horrible mistake.
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / Nanites. Tiny machines built from the atom up.
 BEVERLY / Designed to have exposure only to the inside of nucleii during celluar surgeries. Until then, they are kept tightly confined in a non-functional state.
 DATA / (studying them) These are not ordinary nanites.
 BEVERLY / No, these have... evolved.
 WESLEY / It's true. I'm reponsible. I allowed two of the nanites to interact for my school project to increase their capabilities. And... they escaped.
 PICARD / School... project...
 PICARD / (continuing) Just how far have these things... evolved?
 WESLEY / This is a sample of linear memory crystal from our computer core.
 RIKER / (reacts) It's like candy to them...
 BEVERLY / They're now capable of mechanically replicating themselves. And who knows what else....
 DATA / It is conceivable that with each new generation they enhance their own design. The rate of evolution would be...extraordinary.
 PICARD / How many generations are we dealing with here?
 DATA / Engineering, display computer core processor four-five-one, element zero-two-nine-nine.
 DATA / Increase magnification, factor one thousand.
 PICARD / (understatement) A few. (beat) Can it be possible that they know what they're doing...
 RIKER / Why would they attack us?
 BEVERLY / Doctor Stubbs, these nanites are apparently operating with a new collective intelligence... working together, teaching each other skills...
 DATA / Doctor, are you suggesting they are becoming a... civilization?
 BEVERLY / Then how do you explain what you've seen here?
 PICARD / I cannot exterminate... something that "may or may not" be intelligent.
 PICARD / (sharp) There is still time. (beat) Ensign Crusher, work with Data to find some way to remove them safely. If things get worse, we'll take stronger measures.
 WESLEY / We're testing a low level gamma field that might reduce their processing speed.
 DATA / (reacts) High level gamma radiation would kill them, Doctor Stubbs.
 WESLEY / Doctor Stubbs...
 PICARD / I can't get the story of David and Goliath out of my head. How long do we wait, Number One?
 RIKER / We can continue to bypass parts of the computer that are affected... but if these nanites are spreading all over the ship...
 PICARD / Do you smell a change in...
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to La Forge... enviromental system malfunction on the bridge... acknowledge...
 RIKER / Nitrogen oxide... toxic levels...
 RIKER / I've switched to manual control of the air handling system...
 WORF / He entered a computer access room and sterilized one of the processors with gamma radiation.
 DATA / The nanites in the upper core are all dead, Captain.
 PICARD / If you were a member of my crew, sir, I would...
 PICARD / If one man, woman or child on my ship dies because of your experiment... I will have your head before the highest command of the Federation...
 DATA / Doctor Stubbs, your own actions have provided evidence to the contrary. After you destroyed the nanites in the core, they immediately responded by interfering with our life-support systems. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / It is hard to accept these as random actions by machines with "loose screws". In effect, you may have proven that the nanites do have a collective intelligence.
 TROI / Captain, I'm feeling a vague presence. It wasn't there before. It is not hostility... More like a primitive sense of self-preservation.
 BEVERLY / If they have evolved this far... into emotional growth... how can we destroy them now?
 WORF / The ship is at risk. Extermination may be the only alternative left.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, Doctor Stubbs is to be restricted to his quarters until further notice.
 PICARD / Data, can you find me a way to communicate with these things?
 DATA / With intelligence, they have the capacity for language. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / But it will depend on how far their evolution has brought them. We could modify the circuits in the universal translator to make it capable of communications with them...
 PICARD / Proceed.
 TROI / May I come in?
 TROI / I only want to help.
 TROI / I am only worried about your state of mind, Doctor.
 TROI / Your single-mindedness, your need to have this experiment work...
 TROI / (beat) Your self portrait is so practiced, so polished....
 TROI / It is stretched so tight that the tension fills this room. And if you finally... fail... I fear it will snap.
 BEVERLY / He's coming around...
 PICARD / I have to believe this was not an arbitrary attack...
 BEVERLY / Has Data made any progress in contacting them?
 PICARD / Commander Riker, on my signal, we will gamma-irradiate all computer systems throughout the Enterprise to end this conflict.
 RIKER / Worf, prepare to activate gamma pulse generators.
 WORF / Electromagnetic scanners ready, Captain.
 DATA / Captain...
 DATA / I have established contact.
 WESLEY / Are you okay?
 WESLEY / (a beat) Doctor Stubbs, I want to go the Academy. But if I don't, I have other things to live for.
 DATA / They are virtually learning the concept of communication as we continue, Captain... each new generation is making modifications.
 PICARD / Can we actually talk to them yet?
 DATA / I think it is worth an attempt...
 PICARD / Ask them for a cease-fire... put it in whatever words you think they'll understand.
 DATA / (surprised) Captain, their answer is... no.
 PICARD / Tell them it is critical to their survival as well as our own.
 DATA / Their answer is no.
 TROI / I sense that after the incident in the computer core, there is very little trust...
 PICARD / Bring Doctor Stubbs to the bridge.
 WORF / The universal translator has its limits. I prefer to negotiate eye to eye with my enemy...
 PICARD / I don't think there's much chance of that here.
 RIKER / "One sure way into the history books", Doctor...
 PICARD / Tell them the human who destroyed their comrades is here and wishes to address them...
 PICARD / And you, sir will explain your error and apologize and pray that we can negotiate a peace we can all live with... is that clear?
 DATA / Captain, if a face to face negotiation would be helpful, I would like to volunteer myself as a conduit.
 RIKER / Yourself, Data?
 DATA / I can easily furnish the nanites with a schematic design of my neurological structure. Entering my neural network would require only their most basic skills.
 BEVERLY / That's what they were designed for.
 DATA / They could easily penetrate the molecular fabric of my hand-covering into the nerve circuitry and interface with my verbal programs.
 WORF / If they have control of a Starfleet commander, they become an even greater threat.
 PICARD / How do we know we'll ever get them out of you, Data...
 DATA / There are considerable risks. But it would also represent a gesture of trust on our part. It could be an important step toward peace.
 PICARD / All right. Propose it to the nanites.
 DATA / The answer is yes.
 DATA / They are ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 DATA_NANITE / You are very strange looking creatures.
 PICARD / In our travels, we have encountered many other creatures... even stranger-looking than we are... and all of us try to co-exist peacefully.
 DATA_NANITE / The urge among us to destroy all of your kind is intense. Why did you attack us?
 PICARD / We misinterpreted your actions as an attack against us.
 DATA_NANITE / We were only seeking raw materials for our replication process.
 PICARD / Yes, but you endangered the vessel in which we all travel.
 PICARD / You almost killed a crewmember.
 DATA_NANITE / We meant no harm. We were only exploring.
 PICARD / We understand. We are also explorers and we mean no harm to any life-form.
 DATA_NANITE / We know who you are.
 DATA_NANITE / What is "mercy"?
 PICARD / He asks you to forgive him. This conflict was started by mistakes... on both sides. Let us end it here and now.
 DATA_NANITE / (a beat) We agree.
 PICARD / I pledge to you that we will provide any assistance you need for your continued survival.
 DATA_NANITE / Thank you, but we have evolved beyond any need for your assistance. This vessel has become too confining. We require relocation.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43104.7. Doctor Stubbs has generously used his influence to arrange the designation of planet Kavis-Alpha-Four as the new home of the Nanite Civilization. Plans to negotiate a treaty are underway. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Commander Data's neural network has been vacated... He has been returned to us, unharmed, and with the help of the nanites, our computer core has been reconstructed in time for the experiment...
 DATA / Ten seconds to stellar blast.
 WESLEY / We're at forty million kilometers from the neutron star.
 RIKER / Hold your position.
 PICARD / Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Do you have any children, Guinan?
 BEVERLY / Ever have any trouble relating to them?
 BEVERLY / One?
 BEVERLY / Well, they all go through that.
 BEVERLY / Did he grow out of it?
 BEVERLY / How?
 BEVERLY / Now, see, that's healthy for a boy his age. I mean that as a doctor not just a mother. It's good to see him having fun... with an attractive young woman... who obviously looks at him with extraordinary affection...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) What do you know about this girl?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43042.3. We are cautiously entering the Delta Rana star system three days after receiving a distress call from the Federation colony on its ninth planet.
 WORF, DATA and WESLEY are at their stations. PICARD / and RIKER have their eyes on the Main Viewer. BEVERLY and TROI are present as advisors. The entire ship is on alert, ready for anything.
 PICARD (V.O.) / The garbled transmission reported the colony under attack from an unidentified spacecraft. Our mission is one of rescue and -- if necessary -- confrontation with a hostile force.
 RIKER / Shields up, maximum strength.
 WORF / Shields up. (studying) Sensors do not indicate the presence of any armed space vehicles operating in the Rana system.
 PICARD / They could be cloaked or otherwise shielded. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Mister Crusher, bring us in well clear of the planet's three moons.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Commander, I am not receiving Rana Four's call sign.
 RIKER / Open a frequency to Colony Operations.
 DATA / There is no response. Rana Four is emissions quiet.
 TROI / Captain, there are eleven thousand inhabitants in the colony. At this range I should be feeling something.... I'm not.
 PICARD / Mister Data, put the planet on the Main Viewer.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 BEVERLY / My God...
 RIKER / Helm, put us in a high equatorial orbit. Scan for survivors.
 BEVERLY / Survivors? Down there?
 DATA / Sensors are scanning ninety degrees of longitude as we orbit. I am detecting no artificial structures, no vegetation, no bodies of water...
 WORF / Lifeform readings are negative.
 TROI / Could the colonists have escaped?
 DATA / That is unlikely. Rana Four possessed no interstellar spacecraft.
 RIKER / Who could cause devastation on such a scale?
 WESLEY / Hold it -- hold it! I'm getting something at thirty-seven degrees north, sixty-two degrees east -- a structure!
 PICARD / (hopeful) Life?
 WORF / Two lifeforms. Possibly human.
 PICARD / Put the area on the Main Viewer and magnify.
 DATA / The structure is located at the center of the vegetation.
 RIKER / (disbelieving) An entire planet obliterated... except for a few acres of trees and grass... and one building?
 BEVERLY / It's some kind of illusion...
 DATA / Negative. It is as you see it.
 PICARD / Number One, I think you had better see who's home...
 BEVERLY / If they're the only survivors of a global holocaust, they can't be in very good shape.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Counselor... ?
 TROI / What I sense of them is human...
 PICARD / And something else... ?
 TROI / (hesitates) It's difficult to explain... I feel these two people are somehow... different. (apologetic) I'm sorry. I cannot be any clearer than that.
 RIKER / We're ready.
 PICARD / Good luck, Number One.
 RIKER / Energize...
 RIKER / What can you tell me?
 GEORDI / The house is a typical settlement structure with adaptations. Its thermal properties all seem to conform to known materials.
 DATA / If there are indicators as to why this particular area has remained intact, I cannot detect them.
 RIKER / Worf, the interior of the house.
 WORF / One individual is located at the south end of the house, the other toward the north. There is a weapon -- a low-yield phaser, nonfunctional -- in proximity to the front-room individual.
 RIKER / I guess a frontal assault is unwarranted. Stay here. I'm going to try an old-fashioned knock on the door.
 GEORDI / Commander, there's a --
 RIKER / Commander William Riker, USS Enterprise, and crewmembers. May I get down and approach you, sir?
 WORF / (to Riker) Commander, shall I incapacitate him?
 RIKER / No. (to Kevin) We're a rescue party. We picked up your colony's distress call and came as fast as we could.
 BEVERLY / Do you know of any other survivors?
 RIKER / Who?
 RIKER / You don't know where they came from -- where they are now?
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry. I'm only performing a physical. Could I have your names please -- for the record.
 DATA / Botanists. Originally from the aquatic city New Martim Vaz in the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. Residents of the Rana Four colony for five years. (to Rishon; a smile) You, ma'am, are eighty-two years of age and a composer of Tao-classical music. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (to Kevin) You, sir, are eighty-five years of age and a specialist in symbiotic plantlife. You have been married fifty-three years.
 DATA / (continuing) I memorized the colony register on the way to Rana in the event such information was needed.
 RIKER / Your house -- with your permission I'd like to look inside.
 RIKER / Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've been able to determine, you and your wife -- and this house -- are all that survived the attack. It was either a bizarre coincidence or by design. I don't favor the coincidence theory.
 RIKER / (hesitant) Yes.
 RIKER / I'm not accusing you of anything, Mister Uxbridge. The attacking force spared you for some reason. We're only trying to find out why. (indicates house) May I look inside... ?
 WORF / Sir, may I say that your attempt to hold our away team at bay with a nonfunctioning weapon was an act of unmitigated gall.
 WORF / (rare smile) I admire gall.
 GEORDI / Excuse me. Out front -- that was about the best job of concealing a snare that I've ever seen. Could you tell me what it was for?
 RIKER / I've been in every room. There's nothing unusual about this house except that it's here. What about them?
 BEVERLY / They're in reasonably good health. Both show signs of mental stress. Understandable considering what they've been through.
 RIKER / (mystified) But somehow they're different.
 RIKER / (continuing) Let's get back to the ship. We'll take them with us.
 RIKER / (continuing) Excuse, Mrs. Uxbridge. We have to return to the ship now.
 RIKER / I'm sorry, but we're finished here. We can give you and Kevin time to pack. You can bring as much as you want.
 RIKER / (surprised) Surely you don't want to remain here. How will you take care of yourselves?
 RIKER / You'll be protected on the ship. You could still be in danger on Rana.
 RIKER / All right. I can't make you come with us. Are you familiar with one of these... ?
 RIKER / (continuing) We'll remain in this system for the next several days at least. If you should reconsider, please contact us.
 PICARD / Are they collaborators? Did they in fact provide their colony's assailants with something that abetted the total destruction of Rana Four in order to protect their own lives?
 BEVERLY / What could two botanists in their eighties possess that could possibly aid whoever attacked this planet?
 PICARD / We have no idea what the enemy needed, Doctor. Love, fear, hope -- a cup of tea. It is a strange universe we live in.
 GEORDI / Maybe they're being held hostage in some fashion.
 BEVERLY / Nothing in the tricorder readings indicated emotional stress.
 PICARD / (looks to Troi) Counselor... ?
 PICARD / (continuing) Counselor Troi... ?
 TROI / (coming awake) I'm sorry... I can't sense them well enough...
 GEORDI / Specimens... (off their looks) Maybe they've been preserved as specimens... pets... trophies... exhibits in a zoo...
 PICARD / (thinks) No. The assailants would have picked someone younger for that, someone who would have given them a proper show for their money.
 PICARD / (continuing) Number One, you say the couple is incapable of sustaining themselves?
 RIKER / There's a fusion reactor in the house, probably good for another five years of power. But their watertable is tainted and they have no way of feeding themselves other than a small garden.
 PICARD / They won't come to the ship?
 RIKER / They were adamant.
 PICARD / We'll do all that we can to help them... but in the meantime I want them kept under surveillance.
 PICARD / (continuing) Counselor, is something wrong?
 TROI / I'm sorry... I don't feel well. I would like to go to my quarters...
 PICARD / By all means.
 BEVERLY / Is there anything I can do?
 WORF / Captain, a search of the Ranian system has determined that the hostile force that attacked this planet is no longer present.
 PICARD / I remember a Starfleet admiral saying the same thing about some renegade Andorians in the Triangulum system once. The truth was they'd dismantled their ship and hidden it.
 WORF / (chest out) Those Andorians did not have to contend with someone of my thoroughness. I will stake my reputation.
 TROI / Don't listen... think of something else...
 TROI / (continuing) Stop... please stop!
 TROI / (continuing) Yes --
 PICARD / I was concerned. I came to see if I could be of any help.
 TROI / I'm fine. There's nothing wrong. I'm tired, that's all.
 PICARD / I don't have your gift for reading emotions, Counselor, but I can tell when someone is in pain and hiding it.
 TROI / It's silly... I... I hear music. Music that won't stop. In my mind.
 PICARD / (thinks he understands) Perhaps it's a symptom of fatigue. We've all been inflicted one time or another with the song that wouldn't quit.
 TROI / No... it's deeper than that. The song never stops for an instant. It plays in perfect clarity from beginning to end over and over again. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / I don't even know what song it is -- I've never heard it before!
 PICARD / When did this start?
 TROI / A few hours ago. While the away team was on the surface. I was trying to... I was thinking of Rishon and Kevin...
 PICARD / Rishon and Kevin... And?
 TROI / (shakes head) I can't explain. They're elusive. They're... I'm sorry...
 PICARD / Get some rest. Take the necessary sleep inducements if you have to.
 RIKER / Data, give us a visual. Magnfication factor fifty.
 PICARD / Where did that come from?
 RIKER / Apparently it was riding a Lagrange point behind Rana Four's furthest moon.
 DATA / Our vehicle classification index can put no identity to it. Its design is completely foreign.
 RIKER / But it's our boy -- roughly five times our mass and carrying enough armament to pulverize a planet.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf... ?
 WORF / (deeply ashamed) I... cannot explain this, Captain.
 RIKER / It's moving toward the planet.
 PICARD / Open a hailing frequency, Data. Ask them to identify themselves and to match orbit with us.
 DATA / They have received the message, Captain, but are chosing to ignore it.
 PICARD / Worf, maximum shields, ready all weapon systems.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / It's assuming an attack posture. Don't be surprised if --
 WORF / The vessel is firing jacketed streams of positrons and antiprotons, equivalent firepower of forty megawatts. Shields are holding.
 WORF / (continuing) Again forty megawatts. No damage.
 RIKER / (confident) If that's as good as they can do, this'll be over in five minutes.
 PICARD / Worf, fire phasers... Just a warning shot. Data, repeat the order to stand to.
 DATA / The vessel has assumed a course out of the Rana system and is rapidly increasing velocity.
 PICARD / Helm, initiate pursuit.
 WESLEY / (happily) Aye, sir.
 WESLEY / The vessel has reached warp two and continues on a steady acceleration curve. We aren't getting any closer, Commander.
 RIKER / Give us a superior curve, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Warp three... warp four... The warship is simultaneously matching our curve point per point. Warp four point five... warp five... warp five point five...
 RIKER / (glancing up) Riker to La Forge. Give us everything you can to close the gap, Geordi.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir. I'll get you to Nine point three seven in fifteen seconds.
 WESLEY / Warp eight point five... warp eight point seven five... warp nine... the warship continues to match our acceleration curve perfectly.
 PICARD / I get the impression we're being toyed with, Number One.
 PICARD / (continuing) This ship will not chase a pony on a merry-go-round. Number One, take us back to Rana Four.
 RIKER / Back?
 PICARD / We have unfinished business there. I need to have a talk with those two people.
 RIKER / Reduce speed. Bring us around on a return course. (under his breath) This one's getting away...
 PICARD / Good afternoon. I apologize if I startled you. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Enterprise. (indicates replicator) I've brought you something you badly need if you're going to stay on Rana -- a matter replicator. It has limited capabilities, but...
 PICARD / It will provide you with food and clothing -- clean water. Lieutenant Worf can instruct you in its operation.
 PICARD / We'd like that very much.
 Troi is nearly hysterical. Two of Beverly's MEDICAL ASSISTANTS try to help. / 
 TROI / Stop -- make it stop! Please, I'll do anything -- make it stop!
 BEVERLY / Deanna, please. I'm here to help.
 TROI / It's getting louder! So loud... I can't stand it -- make it stop!
 BEVERLY / Move her to the bed.
 BEVERLY / This will relax you.
 TROI / I hear it! It's still there! It's so loud --
 BEVERLY / (to assistants) Move her to Sickbay.
 TROI / No! I want to stay in my quarters.
 BEVERLY / I can get you to sleep there.
 TROI / I don't want to sleep! The music will only follow me!
 BEVERLY / I can induce delta sleep... Tune out even your deepest dreams.
 TROI / But it's not a dream! You've got to understand that! It's not a dream -- it's real!
 WORF / (trying hard) Good tea. Nice house.
 PICARD / (to Rishon) Why did you leave Earth and move to a brand new world when you did?
 PICARD / It must've been terrible... when the colony was fighting for its life.
 PICARD / But you survived...
 PICARD / I don't have an answer for that. A few hours ago we had an encounter with a warship... Possibly the one which attacked you. We forced it to leave the system but were unable to affect it otherwise. It could return.
 PICARD / (fully alert) Do you know that for a fact, Kevin?
 PICARD / But there had to have been a reason. In some way you and Rishon were "different" from the other colonists. Your geographical location, your philosophical beliefs, the color of your eyes -- somehow you stood apart from them.
 PICARD / That is your protected right.
 PICARD / What about you, Rishon? Did you feel the same way?
 PICARD / Before we go I ask you one more time to come to the ship. For your own safety.
 BEVERLY / I don't understand it. I've inhibited almost all the activity of the neocortex and she continues to behave as if she's hearing the music... (a beat) We're going to have to shield her from all outside stimuli by inducing coma...
 DATA / I have positive identification, Commander. It is the vessel that attacked us earlier. It is reentering the system at high velocity and is approaching Rana Four.
 RIKER / Give us a tight visual, Data.
 RIKER / (continuing) Is it my imagination or does it look a lot meaner this time? (a beat) Shields up. Weapons ready.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Our friend is back.
 PICARD / I am not surprised. Lieutenant Worf, open a hailing frequency. Warn the vessel to stay clear of the planet.
 WORF / Aye, sir. But they are already within firing range.
 WORF / (continuing) Shields down! Captain, they hit us with four hundred gigawatts of particle energy!
 PICARD / Damage?
 WORF / Superficial -- but I am having trouble reassembling the shields!
 WORF / (continuing) Shields down! There is thermal damage to the hull!
 DATA / The warship is in possession of enormous energy reserves. It is capable of striking us with far more powerful bursts.
 WESLEY / They're maneuvering to come between the Enterprise and Rana Four.
 PICARD / Number One, we have been exemplary in our patience.
 RIKER / (with pleasure) Lieutenant Worf, fire phasers on full with a simultaneous spread of torpedoes.
 DATA / The vessel appears undamaged. Its defenses are apparently able to absorb incoming matter and energy.
 RIKER / Commence rapid fire with all weapons on full!
 WORF / Shields are down! There is internal damage -- weapon systems control has been lost!
 RIKER / Riker to Sickbay. Medical assistance to the bridge!
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, move the Enterprise out of range of the attacking vessel!
 WORF / The vessel has terminated its pursuit. It is assuming an orbit around Rana Four.
 RIKER / (suddenly remembering) Rishon and Kevin...
 PICARD / We can't help them... But it's my guess they're in no danger.
 PICARD / Number of casualties?
 BEVERLY / Sixty-six.
 PICARD / Fatalities?
 BEVERLY / None. We've been able to treat everyone.
 PICARD / Can you help her?
 BEVERLY / I've done everything I can. I don't understand the nature of this music she says she's hearing, or where it's coming from.
 PICARD / Could it be telepathic?
 BEVERLY / (a shrug) Yes. But I'm no expert at determining that.
 PICARD / (controlled anger) They're blocking her sensitivity ... keeping her from "seeing" the truth.
 BEVERLY / Who?
 PICARD / Rishon and Kevin.
 BEVERLY / What?
 PICARD / They wanted us to leave Rana... and that's exactly what we're doing.
 PICARD / (continuing) Picard to bridge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Number One, I want you to maintain the present course for another hour, then turn the Enterprise around and take it back to Rana Four.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Sir? We still won't have our shields restored by then.
 PICARD / We're going back, Commander -- and this time nothing is going to lure us away.
 WORF / Sensors indicate no spacecraft in the vicinity of Rana Four. (remembering his previous failure) But Captain --
 PICARD / Forget your previous error, Lieutenant. There was no way you could have prevented it.
 DATA / Captain, the Uxbridge house is coming into transporter range.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf. If you will accompany me to the Transporter Room...
 RIKER / I think you should reconsider this, Captain. The warship has come after us twice, it could come back.
 PICARD / I disagree, Commander. I don't think it knows we're here. I think it believes it's run us off for good. That, however, will change once I'm back on board.
 RIKER / (doesn't follow) Sir?
 PICARD / It's protecting Rishon and Kevin. It responds to their wishes -- directly or indirectly, I'm not sure. That's what I'm going to put to the test.
 PICARD / Celebrating?
 PICARD / This is the second time you've shown surprise at my appearance, Kevin. The first time was understandable, but why now? -- unless you expected never to see me again.
 PICARD / It isn't my intention to interfere, Kevin... only to help you and Rishon.
 PICARD / I promise you that once I leave this house I will never set foot in it again. The Enterprise, however, will remain in orbit over this planet.
 PICARD / To protect you.
 PICARD / But it is necessary, Kevin. Your lives are in great danger. The warship has returned.
 PICARD / (in Kevin's face) We fought a pitched battle with it and lost. Many of my crew have been injured -- including a woman who's mind is slowly being destroyed by a telepathic aberration.
 PICARD / You, Kevin? What about Rishon? Is she in favor of being left at the mercy of a homicidal spaceship?
 PICARD / Come to the Enterprise, Rishon. Let me take you where you'll be safe.
 PICARD / (at Kevin) Then explain to me why you're safe, Kevin. Why is this house a sanctuary from a destructive force that otherwise has no conscience? Does it have to do with you -- with your refusal to fight?
 PICARD / (continuing) Tell me this, Kevin. If Rishon were in danger, would you kill to save her life?
 PICARD / It is my sworn duty to protect you. The Enterprise will remain in orbit around Rana Four as long as the two of you are alive.
 PICARD / Number One -- an update, please.
 RIKER / Little change, Captain. The shields are still inoperable. We have partial control of our weapons. I've doubled the repair crews.
 DATA / Commander. The warship is approaching from high orbit. It is very close -- three hundred thousand kilometers distance.
 RIKER / How is that possible? Is something wrong with the sensors?
 PICARD / That's of no concern, Number One. It's here. And precisely on schedule.
 DATA / The vessel has altered its course to a direct intercept with the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Worf, arm phasers and photon torpedos, prepare to fire.
 PICARD / Belay those orders, Mister Worf.
 DATA / (concerned) The vessel is now within twenty thousand kilometers of the Enterprise and closing.
 PICARD / Let it come, Commander. Activate the Main Viewer.
 WORF / Evasive action, sir?
 PICARD / The Enterprise will stand its ground, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Weapons, sir?
 PICARD / When I give the order. Not before.
 DATA / The vessel is entering a low orbit around Rana Four. (a beat) Captain, it appears it is preparing to fire at the planet.
 PICARD / Understood.
 DATA / My calculations indicate that its target may be the house of Rishon and Kevin Uxbridge.
 PICARD / There will be no interference from us, Mister Data.
 WORF / The house has been obliterated!
 PICARD / Scan for survivors, Lieutenant.
 WORF / There are no survivors.
 PICARD / Ready a photon torpedo. Fire at the vessel when ready.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Commander Riker. What reason does the Enterprise have to remain at Rana?
 RIKER / (trying to figure it) The unknown vessel has been destroyed. The Uxbridges have been destroyed. There is no reason for the Enterprise to remain.
 PICARD / Good. Helm, move us to a higher orbit so that we may keep the surface of the planet under surveillance.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir. But, Captain, what do we watch for?
 PICARD / Anything. If I'm needed I will be in my Ready Room. That is all for now.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Captain, may I speak with you?
 PICARD / (a smile) The pleasure is mine, Number One.
 RIKER / We've been observing the planet very carefully for three hours. We've seen nothing. I have the feeling you're waiting for something to happen.
 PICARD / I have acted on an assumption, Commander. I am not sure what the result will be -- or even that my assumption is correct. (beat) We found two people alive in a house on a devastated planet. But there was only one survivor of the war on Rana Four
 WORF / Why is it we maintain watch on a planet that is now totally dead?
 GEORDI / Bridge to Captain Picard. You had better come see this.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Captain, Commander, it's back -- the house! And the trees and the grass! It happened right in front of us.
 PICARD / (a smile) Worf, do you see survivors?
 WORF / I detect two life-forms inside the house. It appears Kevin and Rishon were not destroyed. But how... ?
 PICARD / Helm, bring us into transporter range. I want them beamed aboard -- directly to the bridge.
 DATA / Captain, will they not protest?
 PICARD / Let them.
 PICARD / (continuing) My apologies if I interrupted a waltz...
 PICARD / To end the suffering of one of my crewmembers.
 PICARD / Kevin does. He's the cause.
 PICARD / (continuing) At first I couldn't figure out why your house had survived the holocaust while all the others hadn't. And then it occurred to me that it had been destroyed. The dwelling where you served me tea and danced your waltzes was a reproduction, something real to the touch but capable of being created and destroyed and recreated at whim.
 PICARD / (to Kevin) More than anything, you wanted the Enterprise away from Rana. Why? (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Because the house, the plot of land, your very own existence, were riddles you were helpless to explain. The warship -- another recreation -- twice tried to chase us away but failed. When I came to the house a second time I provided you with the only condition that would make the Enterprise leave -- your deaths -- and you did your best to satisfy me.
 PICARD / Take you to the nearest starbase where you will be held accountable for the attack on this ship... and perhaps the deaths of eleven thousand people.
 PICARD / But you haven't told us the whole story, Kevin -- how it ended... the part about Rishon.
 PICARD / I can touch you, Rishon. Hear your voice. Smell your perfume. In every respect you are a real person with your own mind and your own beliefs... but you do not exist. You died with the others, defending the colony. He has recreated you just as he has recreated the house.
 PICARD / (continuing) You're the only living thing that really exists on Rana Four, Kevin. And though you look human, you're not.
 GEORDI / He's in the turbolift!
 PICARD / Let him go.
 WORF / Captain -- he is dangerous!
 PICARD / So dangerous, Lieutenant, he could have destroyed us at any instant he wished. Track him. Alert the crew to keep out of his way. I want him to know we mean him no harm...
 RIKER / (to Picard) Will he try to get back to the planet?
 PICARD / Not if he's the creature of conscience I think he is. He has someone to help first...
 PICARD (O.S.) / What happened on Rana Four, Kevin? The truth this time -- all of it.
 PICARD / Your colony was attacked by a warship...
 BEVERLY / (appalled) You had the power to stop them and you didn't?
 PICARD / So you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle.
 PICARD / And then what you feared most happened. Rishon went to fight with the others -- and she died with them.
 PICARD / But you couldn't. You did the unthinkable instead. You took revenge.
 BEVERLY / Why did you try to hide this from us? Was it out of guilt for not helping Rishon and the others when they were alive?
 PICARD / We are not qualified to be your judges. We have no law to fit your crime. You're free to return to the planet... and to make Rishon live again.
 RIKER / Helm... break orbit. Full impulse.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43043.5. We are departing the Rana system for Starbase one three three. We leave behind a being of extraordinary power... and conscience. I am not certain if he should be praised or condemned. Only that he should be left alone...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43125.2. We are en route to Mintaka Three, where a three-man Federation anthropological field team has been studying the inhabitants.
 PICARD is flanked by RIKER and TROI. WORF and DATA / are at their stations; SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Our mission is to resupply the outpost and repair their malfunctioning reactor.
 PICARD / Report, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / We've finished replicating the parts they need. (a beat) What I don't understand is why a three-man station needs a reactor that can produce four-point-two gigawatts.
 RIKER / That's enough to power a small phaser bank, a subspace relay station, or...
 GEORDI / (putting it together) ... a hologram generator. Right -- a "duck blind."
 PICARD / (nods) The anthropologists are studying an extended family of Mintakans at close range... from a camouflaged observation post.
 TROI / According to Doctor Barron's preliminary reports, the Mintakans are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful and highly rational.
 PICARD / (nods) Not surprising, considering how closely their evolution has paralleled Vulcan.
 WORF / Captain, incoming transmission from Mintaka Three.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Do you have battery backup?
 DATA / Captain, if we increase to warp seven we can be there in twenty-three minutes.
 PICARD / Make it so. (to Barron) We're on our way --
 WORF / We've lost contact, sir.
 PICARD / Increase to warp nine.
 DATA / The hologram generator is now functional.
 RIKER / Or would be, if we had power...
 GEORDI / Almost there...
 BEVERLY / Enterprise -- beam Martinez and his patient directly to Sickbay.
 DATA / Doctor --
 BEVERLY / Crusher to Enterprise. Medical emergency. Two to beam directly to Sickbay.
 GEORDI / That should do it.
 BEVERLY / Before you start quoting the Prime Directive -- he'd already seen us; the damage was done. It was bring him aboard or let him die.
 PICARD / Then why didn't you let him die?
 BEVERLY / Because we were responsible for his injuries!
 PICARD / I don't know if I concur with that reasoning, Doctor. But now that he's here, you must remove all memory of his encounter with the away team.
 BEVERLY / By erasing short-term recall?
 PICARD / It's been accomplished before.
 BEVERLY / Yes, I'm familiar with Doctor Pulaski's technique. (studies Liko) Though I can't guarantee it will be effective on Mintakan brain chemistry --
 BEVERLY / (forceful) Doctor Barron! You're on the Enterprise. You're safe now.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Doctor Warren is here. We're doing all we can.
 PICARD / Still on Mintaka Three.
 PICARD / We will.
 PICARD / Rest assured -- we will not leave until we locate Palmer.
 PICARD / Picard to bridge. Report.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Scans of the planet detect no humans, Captain.
 PICARD / Very well. Take us into a close orbit.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Sir, a close orbit will increase sensor efficiency by only four percent.
 PICARD / I want that four percent, Lieutenant.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Picard out.
 BEVERLY / Damn --
 PICARD / Doctor, your next task is clear.
 BEVERLY / ... Barron is stable, but Warren is still critical.
 RIKER / Palmer is missing, and scans of the planet pick up Mintakan life forms only -- no humans. However...
 DATA / The area around the duck blind exhibits Karst topography -- sinkholes, underground rivers, and caverns. And the rock strata contain a high concentration of thallium compounds, which may be obstructing our sensor beams.
 PICARD / So if Palmer, in his delirium, fled into a cave, we might be unable to detect his life signs.
 DATA / Correct.
 BEVERLY / Captain, if he is still alive, he probably needs medical attention. We must send an away team to locate him.
 TROI / But our presence mustn't interfere with the cultural development of the Mintakans.
 PICARD / Agreed. Further contamination must be prevented.
 RIKER / Sir, I have a suggestion.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, Stardate 43125.3. Counselor Troi and I are beaming down to Mintaka Three to locate Doctor Palmer and determine the extent of the cultural contamination.
 RIKER (V.O.) / Doctor Crusher has temporarily altered our features and skin color. She's also implanted subcutaneous communicators so that any transmissions we receive will be inaudible to the Mintakans.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise -- do you read?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (filtered) Perfectly, Commander. I will be monitoring you continuously.
 TROI / Mintakan emotions are quite interesting. Like the Vulcans, they have highly ordered minds... A very sensible people.
 TROI (cont'd) / (enjoying this) For example, Mintakan women precede their mates. It's a signal to other women.
 RIKER / "This man's taken; get your own?"
 TROI / Not precisely... More like, "if you want his services, I'm the one to negotiate with."
 RIKER / What kinds of "services?"
 TROI / All kinds.
 RIKER / (amused) Ah. They are a sensible race.
 RIKER / (sotto) Uh-oh...
 TROI / His memory is intact.
 RIKER / The procedure didn't work.
 TROI / We are visitors; we've come to trade our cloth. May we speak?
 TROI / I am Troi; this is Riker. (to Liko) You've had a very interesting dream.
 TROI / If you are father and daughter, you may have shared the same dream.
 RIKER / Is it any less reasonable than being magically propelled to a strange place by "the Picard?"
 RIKER / Riker to Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER / We have a problem.
 PICARD / The contamination?
 RIKER / It's worse than we suspected. The Mintakans are beginning to believe in a god -- and the one they've chosen... is you.
 PICARD / It's not that simple. He's surrounded by Mintakans. If he dematerializes before their eyes...
 PICARD / Number One -- is there any chance of your freeing Palmer and transporting up unseen?
 RIKER / We can try...
 PICARD / Try hard. Picard out.
 PICARD / I'm aware of that. But each of us -- including Doctor Palmer -- took an oath to uphold the Prime Directive... if necessary, with our lives.
 RIKER / It's senseless to hold this stranger captive. This Overseer talk is nothing more than an old superstition.
 TROI / I've seen another one -- like Palmer!
 TROI / (nods) He's headed toward the caves!
 RIKER / Excuse me... that knot won't hold. If I may assist...
 RIKER / The trick is to make a knot that tightens under pressure. Here, I'll show you...
 RIKER / Forgive me, friend... but the stranger must be set free.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. Lock on and prepare to beam us directly to Sickbay, but wait for my signal.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (filtered) Acknowledged, Commander.
 RIKER / I'm clear. Energize!
 RIKER / Data. Has Counselor Troi beamed up?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Negative, Commander. Sensors show she's in the midst of a group of Mintakans.
 RIKER / Damn.
 TROI / We did not "take" Palmer...
 TROI'S COM VOICE / ... we set him free. Riker and I don't believe these fables about the Overseer.
 PICARD / (to Barron) You believe the Mintakans are capable of harming Troi?
 PICARD / Recommendations?
 PICARD / Are you suggesting...
 RIKER / Masquerading as a god?
 PICARD / Out of the question. The Prime Directive --
 PICARD / By sanctioning their false beliefs?
 PICARD / I cannot -- I will not impose a set of commandments on these people. To do so violates the essence of the Prime Directive.
 RIKER / (to Barron) And you're saying that belief will eventually develop into a religion.
 PICARD / Your own reports describe how rational these people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned all belief in the supernatural. And now you're asking me to sabotage that achievement... send them back into the Dark Ages of fear and superstition. (adamant) No. We must undo the damage we've caused. (turning to Riker) Number One -- tell me about the group's leader.
 RIKER / Nuria is exceptionally fair-minded and sensible... the Mintakans trust her judgment. If we could convince her we're not gods...
 PICARD / ... she might be able to persuade the others.
 PICARD / She sees the Picard as a magical figure. I'm going to show her how the magic works. (a beat) Bring her aboard.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (filtered) Counselor, sensors indicate five Mintakans in your immediate vicinity. (MORE)
 DATA'S COM VOICE (cont'd) / Four are motionless; the fifth is eight meters away, proceeding south. Is Nuria one of these five?
 TROI / ("yes") Mmm-hmm.
 DATA / Was that intended to be an affirmative?
 RIKER / (a smile) Yes, Data, it was.
 DATA / Is Nuria the closest of the five?
 TROI / ("nope") Mmm-mmm.
 RIKER / Negative.
 DATA / Is Nuria the one in motion?
 TROI / ("yes") Mmm-hmm.
 RIKER / Lock sensors on Nuria.
 DATA / Locked on, Commander. We can beam Nuria aboard at will.
 PICARD / Data, when sensors indicate she's alone, beam her to Transporter Room One.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Ensign Hoy, I'll handle this.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Nuria -- don't be afraid.
 PICARD / No one's going to harm you.
 PICARD / My name is Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / Please -- get up.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Get up! You don't kneel to me.
 PICARD / I do not deserve it.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Look at me. Feel the warmth of my hand, the rhythm of my pulse. I am not a supreme being -- I am flesh and blood, like you.
 PICARD / Like you! Different in appearance, yes. But we are both living beings -- we are born, we grow, we live, we die. In all the ways that matter, we are alike.
 PICARD / Let me show you my people. (ALTERNATE:) Let me show you something.
 PICARD / It is wondrous -- but not miraculous. The doors merely work differently from the ones you know.
 PICARD / Seen from far, far above.
 PICARD / Nuria -- your people live in huts. Was it always so?
 PICARD / Why do you now live in huts?
 PICARD / If huts are better, why did your people ever live in caves?
 PICARD / (nods) Just as there was a time when you didn't know how to make cloth -- or bows.
 PICARD / Someone invented huts. Someone invented the bow. And they taught others, who taught their children, who taught their children's children...
 PICARD (cont'd) / Now suppose one of your cave-dwelling ancestors could see you as you are today. What would she think?
 PICARD / Put yourself in her place. You have a power she lacks. You can kill a hornbuck from a great distance.
 PICARD / She has never seen a bow -- it doesn't yet exist in her world. To you, it's a simple tool. To her, it's magic.
 PICARD / And how would she react to you?
 PICARD / Just as you fear me.
 PICARD / Good. My people once lived in caves, too. We learned to build huts... and, later, to build ships such as this one.
 PICARD / Of that, I have absolutely no doubt.
 PICARD / You are indeed a leader.
 PICARD / That is beyond my power.
 PICARD / (almost to himself) I've failed to get through to you, haven't I? Despite all my efforts...
 BEVERLY / Crusher to Picard. I think we're going to lose Warren.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / On my way.
 BEVERLY / (to Medic) Prepare two cc's of norep.
 BEVERLY (cont'd) / (to Barron) I'm sorry.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / No, we are not. (a beat) We can cure many diseases and repair many injuries. We can extend life... but despite all our knowledge -- all our advances -- we are just as mortal as you are... just as powerless to prevent the inevitable.
 TROI / Liko -- you don't want to kill me.
 TROI / Are you sure you know what he wants?
 TROI (cont'd) / (after a beat; to the others) That's one problem with believing in a supernatural being... trying to determine what he wants.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Liko!
 PICARD / No, Liko -- I am not the Overseer. I am a man... a traveller from a faraway land. Nothing more.
 PICARD / You are no one's servant. I deserve neither your obedience nor your worship.
 PICARD / I can't.
 PICARD / I am not angry.
 PICARD / It is beyond my power.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Liko. If I am all-powerful, you can't hurt me. (a beat) If, however, I am telling the truth and I am mortal... you will kill me.
 PICARD (cont'd) / But if the only proof you will believe is my life -- then shoot.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Before we dismantle the observation post and depart, I must make one last visit to Mintaka Three.
 PICARD / Now, Mister La Forge.
 PICARD / A place where we could watch your people.
 PICARD / To study you. To understand your ways.
 PICARD / Because we were once as you are. To study you is to understand ourselves.
 PICARD / It is our highest law that we shall not interfere with other cultures.
 PICARD / Yes. And now we must leave.
 PICARD / (gently) But that would also be interfering. You must progress on your own.
 PICARD / Not even the stars.
 PICARD / Always.
 PICARD and RIKER are standing near an access station / observing the play of information across one of the monitors. WESLEY is at the Conn, DATA is at Ops and TROI is in the command area, while SEVERAL N.D. / CREWMEMBERS are at duty stations or passing through the Bridge.
 DATA / Away Team reporting in, Commander. Lieutenant Worf standing by.
 RIKER / This is Riker, report Lieutenant.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / The archeologists have identified the markings in these caverns. This planet was apparently once home to a race known as the Koinonians.
 PICARD / What do we know about them, Data?
 DATA / The Koinonians were an intelligent culture which became embroiled in a war that lasted several generations. Our best evidence indicates they destroyed themselves.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We have completed our survey of the third tunnel and will proceed into the ceremonial chamber.
 RIKER / Affirmative. Enterprise out.
 PICARD / Destroyed themselves, Data?
 DATA / According to historical records. This will be the first opportunity for a Federation team...
 TROI / Captain! Beam them up quickly! They---
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Emergency beam-up! Enterprise, emergency! Injuries. Away---
 PICARD / Transporter Room!
 PICARD / Beam them straight to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher, incoming wounded.
 WORF is crouched in a defensive position over the prone / and motionless form of LIEUTENANT MARLA ASTER, a woman in her early thirties. Worf's phaser is out and at the ready while his uniform is singed and slightly torn, blood flows from a small wound in his shoulder. Behind him are TWO N.D. CREWMEMBERS, who are archeological officers. Beverly and Medical Supernumeraries move into action...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Away Team is aboard, Captain. (beat) One dead on arrival.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 43506.5 The Enterprise remains in standard orbit while we investigate the tragedy which has struck the Away Team.
 PICARD (V.O) / (continuing) Lieutenant Marla Aster, ship's archaeologist has been killed in what should have been a routine mission. Whatever the explanation, it will not bring back a valued and trusted officer.
 WORF / We had completed our investigation of the third tunnel. Our scans had indicated no weapons or traps of any kind. Lieutenant Aster was three meters behind me. An explosive device went off. There was no warning. Lieutenant Aster bore the full brunt of the detonation. (pause) I was in command. I bear full responsibility.
 PICARD / Lieutenant. I have the utmost faith that you acted properly and in the best traditions of Starfleet.
 BEVERLY / Let's take a look at that shoulder...
 TROI / Lieutenant Aster is survived by a son, Jeremy. Twelve years old.
 PICARD / What about his father?
 TROI / He is also deceased, Captain.
 TROI / (continuing) His only living relatives are an aunt and uncle residing on Earth.
 PICARD / Where is the boy now?
 TROI / In class. I've alerted the teacher to expect us.
 WORF / Captain.
 WORF / (continuing) I must accompany you. I commanded the Away Team.
 PICARD / I appreciate the offer but this is my responsibility.
 BEVERLY / Go to your quarters. Rest. You're relieved of duty for twenty-four hours.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) That's an order.
 PICARD / Picard to Bridge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Assign Commander La Forge to lead another Away Team to the digsite. I want to know why this happened...
 RIKER / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I will be with Counselor Troi and young Jeremy Aster.
 RIKER / (with sympathy) I understand. Riker out.
 WESLEY / He had to do the same thing for me.
 RIKER / Do you know Jeremy well?
 WESLEY / (shakes his head) But I know what it'll be like for him.
 RIKER / It's part of life in Starfleet, Wesley.
 WESLEY / (acknowledges) They're very careful to prepare us for... anything. Still...
 RIKER / I know.
 WESLEY / How can you ever get used to it... to telling them... ?
 RIKER / (softly) You hope you never do.
 TROI / I sense the weight of this duty on you, Captain...
 PICARD / I really wonder...
 PICARD / (to computer) Halt.
 PICARD / I've always believed that carrying children on a starship... it's a questionable policy.
 PICARD / (continuing) Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks and dangers. But did Jeremy Aster make that choice?
 TROI / Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere. Leaving the boy on Earth would not have protected him from that.
 PICARD / No, but Earth is not likely to be ordered to the Neutral Zone to repel a Romulan attack... (beat, softer) It was my command which sent his mother to her death. She understood her mission and my duty. Will he?
 TROI / In time. With help. (beat) Ensign Crusher does.
 TROI / (continuing) Yes, he does. And so will Jeremy.
 PICARD / (to computer) Resume.
 PICARD / Jeremy, it is my sad duty to tell you that your mother has died.
 PICARD / An explosive device at the mission site. She died instantly.
 TROI / I know your mother loved you very much, Jeremy.
 PICARD / I've been told... you've also lost your father.
 PICARD / (softly) No one is alone on the starship Enterprise, Jeremy. No one.
 TROI / I'm sure your mom wanted you to do well in school. Wasn't she a teacher on Earth?
 TROI / Why did she sign on the Enterprise?
 TROI / Was she happy doing that?
 TROI / Did she ever tell you there was a chance this might happen someday?
 TROI / It might help if we talked about how you're feeling.
 TROI / (conversationally) When my father died we were living on Betazed. My mother and all her people are telepathic. I kept wanting to talk about my father, and they kept pulling my thoughts out of my head before I could say the words. It made me very angry.
 TROI / I needed to say them out loud. I was confused about why he went away. Was it me -- something I had done. I felt that if I could just say the words he would somehow know how much I loved him and missed him.
 TROI / (continuing) I thought you might feel the same way.
 TROI / Did she talk to you about her mission before she left?
 TROI / Why do you keep going over to the terminal?
 TROI / (studies him a beat) Was your mother angry when you broke it?
 TROI / (continuing) Was she still angry when she left?
 TROI / (continuing) Jeremy, did that broken terminal cause the accident?
 TROI / Did you cause the accident?
 TROI / Jeremy, if your mother were here right now, would she forgive you?
 TROI / (standing; continuing) I want you to have some time alone for a little while. I'll come back when you're ready to talk again.
 TROI / This time I will use my Betazoid sense, and I'll know.
 DATA / Excuse me. Am I intruding?
 RIKER / No, sit down.
 DATA / How well did you know Lieutenant Aster?
 RIKER / We spent some time together. Not very well.
 RIKER / How well did you know her?
 DATA / Why do you ask?
 RIKER / (reacts) Well... I mean you just asked me...
 DATA / But why do you ask the question? I have been asked several times to define 'how well I knew Lieutenant Aster' since her death. And I heard you ask Wesley on the Bridge if he knew Jeremy well. (beat) Does the question of familiarity have some bearing on death?
 RIKER / (a beat) Do you remember how we all felt when Tasha died?
 DATA / I do not sense the same feelings of... absence... that I associate with Lieutenant Yar... although I cannot say precisely why...
 RIKER / That's just human nature, Data.
 DATA / Human nature, sir?
 RIKER / We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend.
 DATA / But should not the feelings be just as deep regardless of who has died?
 RIKER / Maybe they should, Data. Maybe if we felt the loss of any life as keenly as we felt the death of those close to us, our history would've been a lot less bloody.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Riker...
 RIKER / You're back, Geordi...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Yessir, and we've brought back a souvenier...
 GEORDI / Five more just like it... all identical to the one that killed Lieutenant Aster...
 DATA / They employ a subspace proximity detonator. A normal tricorder would never detect it.
 PICARD / How long would you say they've been there, Data?
 DATA / It comes from the time of the Koinonian Wars, Captain...
 RIKER / Did you find them all, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Yeah. But... (off their looks) Well, they were all sort of... left there to be found.
 PICARD / Left by whom? There are no indications of life on this planet.
 GEORDI / I don't know, Captain... but it was pretty obvious that they'd been recently pulled out of the ground and defused.
 TROI / Worf!
 WORF / (formally) Counselor.
 TROI / I can understand that you don't want to talk about what happened.
 WORF / I have made my report to the Captain.
 TROI / I'm more interested in how you feel about what happened. (a beat) And right now I sense great anger.
 WORF / I cannot seek revenge against an enemy who turned to dust centuries ago.
 WORF / (continuing) Her death was senseless. The last victim of a forgotten war.
 TROI / Go on.
 WORF / There is no more to be said.
 TROI / A person has died while under your command. It may happen again. If you cannot learn to release the anger and the guilt, to talk about it...
 WORF / A leader must stand alone. As Captain Picard does.
 TROI / (a little sharply) Captain Picard talks to me.
 WORF / Then may I seek your counsel about my plan to make the R'uustai with the boy...
 TROI / The Bonding.
 WORF / It is my right.
 TROI / It's a very generous offer, but he's not a Klingon child. He has different sensibilities.
 WORF / He is an orphan. I am an orphan. He will understand.
 TROI / Right now, there isn't much he can understand, Worf. He's holding all his feelings inside... (beat) Children often feel they must be true to the memory of a lost parent. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / If you offer affection to them too soon they can feel guilty returning that affection. As if they're betraying the love they feel for the parent.
 WORF / I only wish to honor his mother.
 TROI / I know. And I understand this means a great deal to you. But you must be prepared, Worf... he is very angry too, but his anger is deep inside him... When he finally touches it, it will strike out in many directions... including yours. (a beat) Talk with him. Be with him. But do not rush this. When he is ready, we will know.
 WORF / Jeremy Aster, I am Lieutenant Worf. May I enter?
 WORF / Yes. I was with Lieutenant Aster, your mother, when she died. (guilty) Her death lies between us. It is my hope...that...someday... it can also bind us.
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / What do they teach you about us?
 WORF / Do they teach you that every Klingon hopes to die in the line of duty as your mother did?
 WORF / In my tradition, we do not grieve the loss of the body... we celebrate the releasing of the spirit.
 WORF / Jeremy Aster, we may both understand it, but we must bring meaning to your mother's death. (beat) Perhaps we can do it together.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Counselor. How is the boy?
 TROI / He is being very brave.
 PICARD / Good.
 TROI / No. He'll have to get past brave. He is a very angry boy... He must learn to express that anger before he can really say good-bye to his mother.
 PICARD / How can we help?
 TROI / I've asked Beverly if we might get Wesley to talk to Jeremy about his father's death...
 TROI / The one unusual element is Worf.
 PICARD / Oh?
 TROI / In many ways he is suffering as badly as the boy. He wishes to involve Jeremy in a Klingon ceremony called the R'uustai... the bonding...
 PICARD / I know it. (thoughtful) Perhaps it would be a comfort to both your patients, Counselor.
 TROI / I don't think the boy would accept Worf right now. Later, perhaps. But it will have to be handled most delicately.
 PICARD / As you always do.
 PICARD / (continuing) I break the unpleasant news and my responsibility ends. You have to stay with them through the entire grieving process.
 TROI / We find many different ways to deal with our pain, but over the years, I've discovered it is in our joy that the uniqueness of each individual is revealed. If I can help a person back to a state of joy... well, my role has its rewards.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, we're picking up an energy field on the planet's surface...
 PICARD / Location?
 RIKER / Two kilometers north of the Away Team's beamdown point.
 PICARD / Indeed. (to Data) Full scan.
 DATA / Inconclusive, Captain.
 TROI / Sir, I sense a... presence on the planet. Very vague.
 PICARD / A life form?
 TROI / I can't be sure... the emotions of the crew are particularly strong right now and it's difficult to filter them out.
 PICARD / Data, scan analysis on Main Viewer...
 BEVERLY / Hi.
 WESLEY / (a litle glum) Hi.
 BEVERLY / Troi stopped by a little while ago. She was wondering if you might be willing to talk to Jeremy Aster at some point.
 WESLEY / (uncomfortable) Me? What for?
 BEVERLY / Because of your Dad.
 WESLEY / What would I tell him?
 BEVERLY / It would help him to talk with someone who's gone through this.
 BEVERLY / We had each other, Wes... he doesn't have anyone to lean on now... and he might be more comfortable talking about it with someone who's not much older...
 WESLEY / (interrupting, don't bug me) Okay. Let me think about it.
 BEVERLY / (beat) Okay.
 WESLEY / You ever think about him, Mom?
 BEVERLY / Your father? (she nods) Sure, I do.
 WESLEY / Sometimes I can't quite remember his face... it scares me.
 BEVERLY / That happens to all of us, Wes... (beat; honest) Sometimes I can't get his face out of my mind.
 WESLEY / (nods) Today... it's like I can see it all as clearly as if it were yesterday... the way he looked when he hugged me good-bye... Captain Picard's eyes when he came to tell us...
 RIKER / Data, run comparison with known phenomena.
 DATA / (works his station) The pattern has no exact match in Federation records.
 PICARD / Is it alive?
 DATA / A possibility.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, I'm getting an unusual magnetic flux reading from the anti-matter containment pods.
 TROI / My God.
 GEORDI / All systems are functioning normally -- still, there's a fluctuation in the containment field. I can't account for it.
 RIKER / Data, is it related in some way to the energy field on the planet?
 TROI / (sotto voce) Captain...
 DATA / There is a beam of highly charged particles emanating from the planet...
 TROI / Captain, there is a presence aboard the Enterprise.
 PICARD / An alien presence... ?
 RIKER / No intruder noted by the ship's sensors, Captain...
 TROI / A presence...
 RIKER / Security, all decks... yellow alert... possible intruder...
 WORF / Jeremy, come here...
 WORF / Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Aster is in her quarters.
 RIKER / Repeat, Worf... ?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Aster. She's here. In her quarters. With the boy.
 PICARD / Do not provoke her or interfere in any way until I arrive. Picard out. (to Riker) Have security moving that way but tell them to keep their distance. You have the Bridge. Counselor...
 WORF / Where are you taking the child?
 WORF / Worf to Picard, they're leaving their quarters...
 WORF / (keys insignia) Captain, I believe we're headed for Transporter Room Three.
 PICARD / We're on our way.
 PICARD / Who are you?
 PICARD / (to Marla) What do you want?
 PICARD / I cannot permit that. This child is my responsibility.
 PICARD / Because I don't know who -- or what -- you are.
 PICARD / Jeremy, she appears to be your mother, but she is not.
 TROI / Jeremy...
 TROI / Jeremy, I don't know what that was, but it was not your mother.
 TROI / Your mother is dead.
 TROI / Why would your real mother want you to go to the planet. There's nothing there but rocks and dust...
 TROI / Yes. It matters.
 TROI / Why would you create this fantasy?
 TROI / But it's not real.
 TROI / Jeremy, it's not. Could your real mother make all this appear?
 TROI / (continuing) You must not stay here.
 TROI / Come with me.
 PICARD / Is the boy in any danger?
 TROI'S COM VOICE / I don't think so. She seems to want to help Jeremy.
 PICARD / Help him?
 PICARD / Troi, would it be wise to remove Jeremy from his quarters?
 TROI / He does not want to leave. I would not recommend taking him by force.
 RIKER / She offers him everything. All we offer is the cold reality of his mother's death.
 BEVERLY / What would you choose? If someone came along and offered to give you back your mother... (toware Wesley) ... your father... (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / ... your... husband... would any of us say no so easily?
 PICARD / Remain in the cabin with them, Counselor. We're going to try to put an end to this from here...
 TROI / Understood.
 PICARD / Mister Data, can we determine for certain the energy source from the planet is powering this creation?
 DATA / The beam from the planet is clearly tapping into the ship's anti-matter, Captain...
 GEORDI / I'd say it's running the manifestation off our own energy.
 PICARD / So there are limits to her power...
 RIKER / (nods) That's why she needs the Transporter to get the boy off the ship.
 PICARD / So how do we cut the puppet's strings?
 GEORDI / By increasing the shield harmonics to match our antimatter containment fields, it is almost certain that the beam would be severed.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 RIKER / (to com) Troi, stand by...
 TROI / Jeremy, it's time for this to end... You know it's not real and it is over now...
 TROI / Jeremy, I won't lie to you or trick you.
 GEORDI / Anti-matter containment pods reading nominal...
 DATA / The shields have severed the beam.
 DATA / Captain, the energy field...
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, take us out of...
 WORF / (to com) Security to Transporter Room Three...
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, Commander La Forge with me... Number One you have the Bridge.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / (urgently) Captain, the image is back -- she's trying to take Jeremy off the ship again.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / (keys insignia) Engineering, this is La Forge. Shut down power to all Transporters. I'm on my way...
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, to Transporter Room Three.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Bridge, seal off deck eight, corridors A and B.
 DATA / Engaging force fields, Captain. Transporters are down.
 WORF / Energy force has left Transporter Room Three... security alert, all decks...
 RIKER / La Forge, the intruder may try to reinstate Transporter power.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Understood, Commander...
 PICARD / Bridge, release security forcefield eight - B.
 PICARD / How are you, Jeremy? Are you frightened?
 PICARD / Of course. These are frightening things that are happening. We won't let anyone harm you. (off-handedly) Counselor, why don't you take the child to my quarters.
 GEORDI / (keys insignia) It's looking over everything, Commander... going to school... Let's hope it doesn't blow us to Kingdom Come while it's figuring out how to blow us to Kingdom Come.
 WORF / Power's back in Transporter Room Three...
 GEORDI / By-passing to manual override... shutting it down...
 WORF / Transporter is down again.
 RIKER / Keep it down, Geordi... for as long as you can...
 PICARD / We? For whom else do you speak?
 PICARD / I appreciate your motives. But his mother is dead. He must learn to live with that.
 PICARD / But not his mother.
 PICARD / Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / Go ahead, Captain.
 PICARD / Please escort Ensign Crusher to the Aster quarters. Picard out.
 PICARD / It is at the heart of our very nature... to feel pain... and joy... that is what makes us what we are.
 PICARD / For a brief moment in time... he surely would be. Any of us in his place would be.
 TROI / What would Jeremy do for friends in your world?
 TROI / And then will you provide for his education, his health, his growth? A career? A wife?
 PICARD / Yes, it is quite an undertaking you're proposing, isn't it?
 PICARD / Do you honestly believe he will be happy in this total fiction you wish to create?
 PICARD / What will be his reason to live?
 PICARD / What you offer is a memory... to cherish... but not to live in. (beat) It is part of our life cycle to accept the death of those we love. He must deal with grief, not cover it or hide from it. We are mortal. Our time in this universe is finite. It is the lesson every human must learn.
 WESLEY / Ensign Crusher reporting as ordered, sir.
 PICARD / Come in, Wesley.
 PICARD / ... No, stay, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / Wesley lost his father on a Starfleet mission when he was even younger than you are.
 TROI / Your mother told me you were finding it difficult to talk to Jeremy. Why?
 WESLEY / I don't know. I guess... I just didn't want to think about it any more, you know... all this has reminded me so much of that day...
 PICARD / The day I told you your father had been killed.
 PICARD / As I recall, you handled the news very well.
 WESLEY / My parents taught me about the dangers of starfleet missions. I knew it could happen.
 PICARD / (probing) So you were prepared.
 WESLEY / (a beat, introspective) No, I don't think I was. Not really. How could anyone be... prepared to hear that his dad is... never coming home again.
 WESLEY / I just tried to be what everybody expected me to be. Brave. Mature.
 PICARD / Are you saying you didn't want anybody to see how you really felt, Wesley?
 PICARD / So how did you really feel?
 WESLEY / (whispers) Like somebody kicked me right in the brain.
 PICARD / (gently) Somebody?
 TROI / Go ahead, Wesley. You've wanted to tell him for a long time...
 WESLEY / I was angry. (long beat) At you.
 PICARD / Why, Wesley? Why were you angry with me?
 PICARD / Were you angry because I was the one who told you he was dead?
 WESLEY / (pause) No.
 PICARD / Then why?
 WESLEY / Because you led the mission. You came back. My father didn't.
 TROI / How long were you angry with Captain Picard, Wesley?
 WESLEY / A long time. (turns to Picard) But not any more. Not even a little, sir.
 TROI / And you Jeremy... must be very angry with Lieutenant Worf.
 TROI / He was in charge of your mother's mission. Just as Captain Picard was in command when Wesley's father was killed. Isn't that right, Jeremy
 WORF / She was my responsibility.
 TROI / Worf came back. Your mother didn't.
 TROI / He can't answer that, Jeremy. (to Marla) None of us can.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf also lost his parents, Jeremy.
 WORF / (to Jeremy) They were killed in battle when I was six.
 WORF / When I was alone, humans helped me. Let me help you.
 WORF / The Marla Aster I knew and honored is not in this room. Nor does she await you on the planet. Now she lives only here... (touches his chest) And here.
 WORF / (to Jeremy) Join with me in the R'uustai, the Bonding. You will become part of my family now and for all time. We will be brothers.
 WORF / SoS jIH batlh SoH.
 WORF / It honors the memory of our mothers. We have bonded and our families are stronger.
 GEORDI / Another Coco-no-no?
 GEORDI / Yeah, me too.
 GEORDI / (tense) What?
 GEORDI / You're chilly... ? I can turn down the breeze...
 GEORDI / (knows what's coming) Yeah...
 GEORDI / Yeah...
 GEORDI / Knock it off.
 WESLEY and DATA standing at the window looking out the / windows at a field of immense flotsam and jetsam moving by, the remains of a planet destroyed in a battle long ago...
 WESLEY / This was the final battle, wasn't it?
 DATA / (acknowledges) Neither side intended Orelious Nine to be the decisive conflict.
 WESLEY / Not much of it left, is there...
 DATA / The destruction is remarkable considering the primitive weapons of the period.
 WESLEY / Uh oh...
 DATA / I beg your pardon, Wesley?
 WESLEY / (off his look) "Uh oh"... it's an expression, Data. It just means, you know, uh oh, something's wrong...
 DATA / There is something wrong?
 WESLEY / Commander La Forge had a big date with Christy tonight. He's been working on the perfect program for days. Looks like it ended kinda early.
 DATA / Uh oh.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Commander Data to the bridge immediately.
 DATA / Acknowledged.
 PICARD, RIKER, WORF are already at their stations as / Data ENTERS. Riker fills them in...
 RIKER / We're picking up a signal, coordinates two-one-one mark six-one.
 DATA / (reacting to the signal) It is an ancient interplanetary code.
 RIKER / Survivors on Orelious Nine after all this time... not possible.
 PICARD / Not at all possible. Lay in a course to the source of the signal.
 DATA / Approaching the source, Captain...
 PICARD / Put it on the viewer, Mister Data.
 WORF / A Promellian battle cruiser.
 PICARD / (enthusiastic) And with its Lang Cycle fusion engines intact.
 DATA / Scanners indicate no life signs aboard.
 PICARD / I should hope not. That ship belongs in a museum. (moving closer) Gentlemen, I'm afraid we're a little late. This call for help was very likely initiated over a thousand years ago.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43799.1. We have arrived at Orelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars and Promellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we have found a relic: a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the centuries.
 PICARD / Indulge me, Number One...
 RIKER / I'd prefer Lieutenant Worf and I did a security sweep of the vessel first...
 PICARD / (frowns) No. Captain's prerogative, here. This one's mine. We've examined every conceivable risk...
 RIKER / The risks aboard a vessel this old and fragile are inconceivable, Captain...
 PICARD / Ghosts, perhaps? (beat) Haven't you ever dreamed of climbing inside the bottle... ?
 RIKER / Sir... ?
 PICARD / The ship in the bottle, Number One. Model air ships... I used to build them as a child. By God, I'll bet I even had a Promellian battle cruiser too.
 PICARD / Ready to beam the away team to the vessel...
 RIKER / You're certain about the atmospheric conditions, Data... ?
 DATA / There is adequate oxygen for life support, Commander...
 PICARD / It is exactly as they left it, Number One. In the bottle. (off their looks) Good Lord, didn't anyone else here build ships in bottles when they were boys?
 WORF / I did not play with toys.
 DATA / I was never a boy.
 PICARD / (to a compatriot) Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Proceed.
 RIKER / What's that?
 RIKER / Let me know.
 PICARD / Extraordinary. You would expect the layout of a bridge from this era to be clumsy, awkward... but see this -- it is a model of simplicity. They built the same craft for generations. And it worked.
 WORF / Admirable. They died at their posts.
 GEORDI / Don't you have anything stronger than this, Guinan?
 GEORDI / Would it help?
 GEORDI / Can you tell me something, Guinan? You're a woman, right?
 GEORDI / What is it that... you want in a man?
 GEORDI / As a woman. What's the first thing you look at?
 GEORDI / Uh huh... his mind, of course.
 GEORDI / Seriously?
 GEORDI / Why?
 GEORDI / I'd like to do that.
 GEORDI / I mean take care of somebody. (beat) Guinan, I just don't get it... I can field strip a fusion reactor... I can realign a power transfer tunnel... why can't I make anything work with a woman like Christy? I don't know what to do, what to say...
 GEORDI / You're different.
 GEORDI / But I'm not trying now.
 DATA / The source of the distress signal is twenty meters ahead...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, be sure we get tricorder images of their tactical display...
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Look here, Worf... how well laid out it is. We went through how many different designs before we reached this kind of sophistication... ?
 DATA / I believe it was four, sir. We did not have a fully integrated tactical command until the twenty-third century. In fact, several of the Promellian innovations served as inspiration for early Federation starship design...
 PICARD / As well they should have.
 PICARD / Positron ducts. These channeled power from one end of the ship to the other.
 WORF / It is safe to enter.
 PICARD / Let's put an end to their last cry for help.
 DATA / Captain...
 DATA / I believe this is an information storage device... a crude analogue of our own iso-linear optical chip.
 PICARD / Crude by our standards today, Data. When this ship was built, humans on Earth had just perfected the mechanical clock... and were using steel crossbows in battle. (examining it) Is there any way to see what's on this?
 DATA / Questionable. I can supply power to the playback unit, Captain... but the components are quite old... I will attempt to amplify its image with a tricorder...
 RIKER / What is it, Wes?
 WESLEY / The main power return is acting a little weird...
 RIKER / Define "weird".
 WESLEY / I'm getting fluctuating waveguide readings...
 RIKER / Run a maintenance sweep.
 WESLEY / Right.
 PICARD / Indeed, sir. (keys insignia) Picard to Enterprise.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Captain.
 PICARD / I think we've seen just about all there is to see here. At Mister O'Brien's convenience... we are ready to return...
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / You were absolutely right, Number One. There were ghosts aboard the old ship after all... one of them even spoke to us.
 RIKER / A friendly one, I hope.
 PICARD / My own counterpart. The ship captain's final message... praising his crew.
 RIKER / I hope you'll be as thoughtful when the time comes.
 PICARD / Data, advise the Astral-Five annex of the Smithsonian... This should be catalogued and scheduled for retrieval...
 TROI / I'm sorry... it's just a rare pleasure to meet this side of your personality, Captain.
 PICARD / (gruff) Mister Crusher, set our course for the original coordinates.
 WESLEY / Yessir.
 DATA / Captain, we are experiencing a two percent drop in our energy reserves. Compensating.
 RIKER / (to Picard) We were having a few problems while...
 WORF / (concerned) Readouts indicate we are being bombarded with a field of high intensity radiation.
 RIKER / Shields up.
 DATA / Captain, energy loss increasing to five percent. I am unable to correct.
 PICARD / Yellow Alert.
 GEORDI / Maybe I should've gone with the Mardi Gras program... something a little livelier...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Mister La Forge, report to Engineering...
 GEORDI / On my way, Commander.
 GEORDI / Save my seat, Guinan.
 DATA / Energy loss increasing.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, reverse course. Full impulse power.
 WESLEY / Sir, there's no response.
 PICARD / Increase speed to warp one.
 WESLEY / Engines are not responding, sir.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, I need warp power now!
 GEORDI / Matter_anti-matter mixture ratio settings at optimum balance... Reaction sequence corresponding to specified norms... Magnetic plasma transfer to warp field generators per program specs. Commander, we should be going like a bat out of hell.
 DATA / Power loss now at twelve percent.
 PICARD / Red Alert.
 WORF / Radiation intensity increasing.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We better slow these engines down before we burn out the reaction chamber.
 RIKER / Slow to idle, Geordi.
 PICARD / Is it possible... have we stumbled into the same snare that killed them? A thousand-year-old... booby trap?
 GEORDI / With the engines idling, the energy loss has been limited. But our reserves will be depleted in less than three hours. We won't be able to hold our shields in place.
 BEVERLY / If we lose shields, the radiation will kill everyone on board, Captain.
 DATA / Not everyone, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / I stand corrected.
 PICARD / Have you identified the source of the radiation, Mister Worf?
 WORF / No, sir. The radiation field is too strong -- it interferes with our sensors.
 PICARD / And no apparent explanation for the loss of energy... ?
 RIKER / Anything in the history books, Data that might give us a clue... ?
 DATA / There are many fascinating records of Menthar battle strategy... they were exceptionally innovative. In fact, they were the first to devise the Kavis Teke elusive maneuver as well as a Passive Lure stratagem that is comparable to Napoleon's...
 RIKER / (interrupting) Any mention of a situation like this?
 DATA / No.
 RIKER / Recommend I lead an away team to the cruiser.
 GEORDI / They didn't have much success with this problem, Commander...
 RIKER / But at least they knew their enemy better than we do. Maybe they even knew how they got into trouble... they just didn't know how to get out.
 PICARD / Agreed. Worf, what would be the impact of lowering shields long enough to get an away team out... ?
 WORF / Negligible, sir.
 GEORDI / It won't help our energy conservation any, Captain.
 PICARD / That's your job, Commander La Forge. Determine a way to keep the Enterprise up and running. Data, you will join Commander Riker on the away team. Find out what happened to that ship.
 DATA / (keys insignia) Radiation factor is within safe human limits, Commander.
 RIKER / Why isn't this ship being hit with radiation?
 DATA / That is curious, Commander. The radiation field must be directional in nature... aimed only at the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Maybe our own engines triggered it somehow... (beat) Data, see if you can determine what kind of defenses the Promellians tried to employ... I don't want to waste time trying them again...
 DATA / Understood.
 RIKER / What'd really help us is a ship's log... any kind of record of their last battle.
 GEORDI / (to himself) So why can't we move?
 GEORDI / Computer, as we increased our power levels, was there any counter-reaction?
 GEORDI / So it kept us from forming a subspace field for the warp drive?
 GEORDI / (reacts) Computer, who is this L. Brahms?
 GEORDI / Junior member, huh. Looks like she wrote the book on propulsion. (beat, considering) Call up subspace design logs...
 GEORDI / (a beat, why not?) Voice entries.
 GEORDI / Geordi La Forge. How ya doin, Doc...
 GEORDI / Yeah, down to work. You're absolutely right.
 BEVERLY / I recommend we evacuate and seal off all non-operational areas and group the families and crew on odd-numbered decks.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 BEVERLY / I'd also like to set up an assembly area for treating radiation in case we need it.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) After the shields fall, how long for a fatal exposure?
 BEVERLY / Thirty minutes. After that, there's nothing that can be done.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Away team to bridge. Captain, we may have found something...
 RIKER / (continuing) We're in the Promellian communications area...
 RIKER / There's a file of memory coils here...
 DATA / They are identical to the coil we found earlier, Captain...
 PICARD / Their captain's log, perhaps?
 RIKER / That's what we were thinking.
 PICARD / Data, are the coils in working condition?
 DATA / I believe so. We can enhance them through the image processor in the ship's computer.
 PICARD / Good. Return at once.
 GEORDI / What about the dilithium crystal control?
 GEORDI / (hopeful) Yes?
 GEORDI / (frowns) Great. Thanks a lot. Computer, generate a cross section image of the dilithium crystal chamber.
 GEORDI / What about reorienting the crystal?
 GEORDI / Sorry, can't wait. You and me, Leah. We have two hours to figure this out.
 GEORDI / You know what I need to do -- I need to get inside there. I need to turn that thing inside out... (standing) Computer, is there a cross section of the engines we can replicate on a Holodeck?
 GEORDI / Prototype? Elaborate...
 GEORDI / Perfect. Recreate it in Holodeck Three. Stay with me, Doc.
 GEORDI / Ready computer?
 GEORDI / Damn. Right back where it all started. This is incredible...
 GEORDI / Leah, did you design this?
 GEORDI / Sure, that's visiting dignitary talk, what's the inside story... off-the-record?
 GEORDI / Another woman who won't get personal with me in the Holodeck.
 GEORDI / Leah, I want to find a way to supplement the energy supply to the ship and to the engines. Could we alter the matter_anti-matter paths?
 GEORDI / Well, this is your baby, show me which ones...
 GEORDI / Computer, did I ask for a simulation?
 GEORDI / I did do that, didn't I?
 GEORDI / Okay... Leah... good to see you...
 GEORDI / Real good.
 GEORDI / Continue your analysis.
 GEORDI / Then, if we use multiple injector streams, hitting more than one crystal facet, we could do it... we could hold our own. Leah, you're beautiful. (keying insignia) La Forge to Picard....
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, we've found a way to extend the matter_anti-matter energy supplies.
 PICARD / Well done, Mister La Forge.
 RIKER / Geordi, can you give us enough energy to get us out of here?
 GEORDI / Sorry, Commander... we haven't addressed that one yet. First priority was to maintain shields.
 RIKER / Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / We'll get on it, right away, though...
 PICARD / Pass on my congratulations to your team, Commander.
 GEORDI / Thanks, Captain. We're... all smiles down here.
 PICARD / Picard out.
 DATA / We have been able to verify that these coils are logs of the Promellian captain... but most of them have decayed and cannot be repaired...
 RIKER / They're beyond any sort of playback... ?
 DATA / On most there are brief sections that may yield some information.
 RIKER / Do the best you can, Data. Let's just hope we have the brief section we need...
 PICARD / (to Riker) He must have logged the cause of his ship's death. What captain wouldn't?
 RIKER / They were all in an open locker. I don't think he was too concerned with security.
 GEORDI / (to computer) ... 452 through system L-575.
 GEORDI / Impact analysis, computer.
 GEORDI / All right.
 GEORDI / Computer, do you have any... you know... personality... on file for Doctor Brahms?
 GEORDI / Did she ever debate at the intergalactic caucuses on Chaya-seven?
 GEORDI / Never mind the dates... (beat) Computer, if you add all data from these sources, could you synthesize a true representation of Doctor Brahms?
 GEORDI / I can live with that. Make it happen.
 GEORDI / Doctor Brahms?
 GEORDI / (smiles) Right.
 GEORDI / Right.
 PICARD / Aceton assimilators -- ?
 DATA / An Aceton assimilator is a primitive generator which can drain power from distant sources.
 RIKER / Generator...
 DATA / It would not be difficult to modify them to convert energy into radiation.
 RIKER / (theorizing) The Menthars hide them in the floating debris... and an unsuspecting enemy ship flies in... instant booby trap.
 PICARD / And now we're supplying the devices with the energy to kill us.
 GEORDI / No... no... no...
 GEORDI / You can't boost the warp power that way...
 GEORDI / I want to give us enough power to strengthen the shields and barrel out of here... not blow us up...
 GEORDI / I don't care if you built it with your bare hands out of an old Ferengi cargo ship, it's going to go --
 GEORDI / -- and we're going with it.
 GEORDI / And I'm not used to dying. (beat) You worked in a lab on a static model. This is a working machine, it has tens of thousands of light years on it.
 GEORDI / Damn right. (calmer) We'd never be certain the circuit paths are sealed.
 GEORDI / (shrugs) I know my ship. Inside and out.
 GEORDI / I always wished the chief engineer could be present when a ship is being built.
 GEORDI / You're there now.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Commander La Forge to the bridge.
 GEORDI / On my way, Commander. (to Leah) Don't go anywhere. (beat, second thought) I mean, computer -- save program.
 PICARD / How many of these devices do we think we're dealing with?
 DATA / To create the radiation field we are experiencing, it would take several hundred thousand, Captain...
 RIKER / They've been out there a long time, Data... there must be some deterioration....
 DATA / There is no way to calculate that precisely, Commander... but it is likely...
 PICARD / Is there any indication of a weakness in a specific part of the field...
 WORF / Nothing substantial, Captain.
 PICARD / Of any kind.
 WORF / A point-one percent dip in the strength of the radiation field at two-one mark eight by four-two mark zero...
 PICARD / I'll take that point-one percent.
 RIKER / Recommend we fire a directional phaser pattern at those coordinates...
 GEORDI / We won't be able to maintain energy reserves... we might even lose some circuits in the new configuration...
 PICARD / How critical would the losses be?
 GEORDI / Not enough to shut down our engines... but if we don't make it... I don't know if we could hold shields.
 DATA / There is also the possibility the phasers will supply the assimilators with what they need most -- energy.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, alternative suggestions?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) Maybe down the road, Captain... But we can't overload the dilithium crystals much longer.
 PICARD / I imagine a discussion very much like this took place on our neighbor's ship a thousand years ago. May our decisions meet with more success than theirs. (decides) Mister La Forge, you will return to Engineering and continue your efforts without delay. Mister Worf, prepare the phasers.
 WORF / Phasers locked on coordinates.
 RIKER / Fire.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Nothing.
 WORF (O.S.) / Radiation levels increasing, Captain. Eight percent. Ten percent.
 DATA (O.S.) / Energy reserves on board dropping rapidly...
 PICARD / Damn you.
 GEORDI / Wouldn't that increase the output of the parallel subspace processors to gain a quicker response time... ?
 GEORDI / Yeah, but how do we reconfigure... ?
 GEORDI / Computer, override standard procedure...
 GEORDI / What? -- computer --
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / The crystal lattice is breaking down...
 GEORDI / (continuing) We'll have to pick up repairs when we can reach a starbase....
 RIKER / The optimist in the group.
 PICARD / How long do we have shields based on current calculations... ?
 WORF / Under two hours, Captain. And the radiation field has increased by seventeen percent.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Impact on fatal exposure?
 BEVERLY / Down to twenty-six minutes.
 RIKER / If we resist, we die. If we don't resist, we die.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, have we shut down all non-essential energy usage?
 GEORDI / Yes, Captain. In fact, I need to get some back... I'm running a program on Holodeck Three...
 PICARD / For what purpose?
 GEORDI / I've gone back to the beginning... to the earliest construction entries of the Enterprise. I've created... a... propulsion design model to assist me. I believe we're... making progress...
 PICARD / Computer, reinstate Holodeck Three program.
 PICARD / Your best suggestion in an hour, Mister La Forge. Picard out.
 GEORDI / Computer, resume Holodeck Three program.
 GEORDI / Somehow, we have to generate enough energy to get out of here... but we've got a booby-trap that eats energy for breakfast... how do we fool it, block it, shut it down, anything...
 GEORDI / Okay, we know for every movement the Enterprise makes, there's a counter-movement from the energy field... could we use that to our advantage somehow...
 GEORDI / Yes...
 GEORDI / Leah, you like Italian food?
 GEORDI / (re: computer) Okay, fusion reactor uplink to navigation processor...
 GEORDI (O.S.) / But then we have to adjust the drive coils... and the vector processor... it's impossible..
 GEORDI / Don't do that...
 GEORDI / I don't want to feel that good right now. What time is it?
 GEORDI / God, what am I supposed to tell the Captain?
 GEORDI / It's possible and yet it's impossible... everything we've done says we can't adjust fast enough... but if we could, it might work...
 GEORDI / Data couldn't even do it. It'll take a hundred... maybe even a thousand adjustments every second... how are you gonna do it? It's humanly impossible.
 GEORDI / You mean the computer could do it.
 GEORDI / (almost introducing) Captain, this is... a holographic simulation of one of the propulsion experts who designed the Enterprise engines... Leah Brahms. Doctor Leah Brahms.
 GEORDI / We... I've been examining the force and counter-force response time... and trying to see if we could create linkage at maximum power...
 PICARD / The bottom line, Commander.
 GEORDI / There's a chance we could manuever out of the trap... if we turn the ship over to the computer.
 PICARD / What kind of chance?
 GEORDI / I don't know yet. But we can program it and try it out on a few simulated runs.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 PICARD / This is the only way...
 GEORDI / I think so, Captain.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Any word from La Forge?
 PICARD / He's come up with something that might give us a chance. If we agree to stay out of it.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / He proposes to turn control of the ship over to the computer because it is capable of making quicker adjustments than any human being.
 RIKER / Computers have always impressed me by their ability to take orders; I'm not at all as certain about their ability to give them.
 PICARD / Especially with a thousand lives at stake. (frowns) What choice do I have? (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) You missed something by not playing with model ships. They were the source of one boy's imaginary voyages, each holding a treasure of adventures. Manning the earliest space craft. Or flying a plane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky. Imagine that. (beat) Now, the machines are flying us.
 GEORDI / Computer, reduce thrust levels another four percent... adjust trajectory angle to compensate... begin simulation again...
 GEORDI / Repeat simulation, same levels.
 GEORDI / Swell. Same variables. Only this time the computer didn't quite make it...
 GEORDI / I can't do it.
 GEORDI / And it might not. I can't ask the captain to turn the ship over to a computer.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to La Forge.
 GEORDI / Captain... two minutes... give me just two minutes....
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / There is another way, Captain... two minutes...
 PICARD / Two minutes. Picard out.
 GEORDI / (interrupting) No..no... wait, listen... turn it upside down, literally... come at it from the opposite direction... God, it's so simple... it might even work...
 GEORDI / Computer, shut up... at least in Holodeck Three...
 GEORDI / Computer, new simulation...
 GEORDI / Everything we've been trying to do is based on overpowering the trap... more energy, faster adjustments... but that's exactly what we can't do, because that's what we're supposed to do. That's the booby trap. (beat) The answer is in our own computer... the mind -- the best piece of engineering we'll ever need.
 PICARD / Didn't your research suggest thousands of adjustments would be required per second?
 GEORDI / Not if we turn everything off.
 GEORDI / One blast of everything we've got left for a microsecond to beat the inertia and then we shut it all down except minimal life support and two thrusters. No impulse engines. No computer.
 RIKER / One propeller, Captain...
 PICARD / Have you analyzed the risk factor?
 GEORDI / The numbers say it's even money. No better than handing it over to the computer. No worse either. But I say forget the numbers. There's no way for a computer to compensate for the human factor... the intuition, the experience...
 PICARD / Make it ready.
 GEORDI / I've run the simulations... If you want me to take Conn...
 PICARD / No, Mister La Forge. You've done your job. Now I must do mine.
 PICARD / I relieve you, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / (to com) All hands, this is Commander Riker. We are about to engage impulse engines for a short burst. Inertial dampers are on manual. They may not fully compensate for acceleration. Brace yourselves.
 RIKER / Computer, discontinue radiation warning till further notice.
 PICARD / Firing impulse engines.
 DATA / Impulse engines are now down.
 GEORDI / Shutting down all systems.
 DATA / Velocity is one hundred thirty two meters per second.
 WORF / We will enter the debris field in eight seconds.
 DATA / Starboard thruster firing.
 RIKER / Coming to heading three-four-zero mark one-zero.
 RIKER / Captain, that large mass to port may contain an assimilator.
 DATA / Port thruster firing...
 WORF / No reaction from the assimilator.
 RIKER / We're past the first hurdle.
 WORF / Sir! Object to port --
 DATA / Starboard thruster.
 DATA / Sir, the gravitational attraction of the various masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent. By my calculations, we no longer possess sufficient momentum to clear the debris field --
 PICARD / Thank you, Mister Data.
 DATA / Port thruster...
 DATA / The asteroid's gravity is drawing us closer. Velocity increasing.
 DATA / Velocity still increasing... now two hundred and nineteen meters per second.
 DATA / Starboard thruster.
 DATA / (to Picard) You have used the asteroid's gravitational pull as a slingshot. Excellent.
 RIKER / We're out. We beat it.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, the conn is yours.
 WESLEY / (with great respect) Yes, sir!
 PICARD / Initiate full restart. Bring all systems back on-line.
 GEORDI / With pleasure, sir.
 PICARD / Number One... make sure the booby trap won't bother anyone again.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, ready photon torpedoes, all bays... set to detonate upon impact with the Promellian vessel.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / I've always thought that technology could solve any problem. It enhances our quality of life... It lets us travel across the galaxy... It even gave me my vision. (beat) But sometimes you just need to trust yourself and turn it all off. Even the gypsy violins.
 GEORDI / Different program. Sorry.
 GEORDI / Maybe we could do it again some time.
 GEORDI / Computer, exit Holodeck. Save program.
 RIKER / Marking beam-out position. Return transport: fourteen minutes, forty seconds.
 RIKER / Your view any better, Geordi?
 GEORDI / (adjusting his VISOR) Not too bad, sir. A lot of charged-particle precipitation, but I can compensate.
 WORF / Communicators are dysfunctional.
 RIKER / Tricorders?
 WORF / Readings only valid within five meters.
 GEORDI / (re: his tricorder) I'm not so sure of that... I'm reading Worf as an unintelligent life form.
 RIKER / Good thing we didn't bring Data... we would've been unscrambling his circuits for a week...
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Picking up something on the positron scan, Commander.
 GEORDI / Over here. Some electrically conductive objects.
 RIKER / Recognize the markings, Worf?
 WORF / Yessir. Romulan.
 RIKER / I wonder what the hell they were doing in a Federation sector.
 GEORDI / I'm picking up traces of ultritium residue with my VISOR, Commander. An explosive device must've been used to destroy the craft after it crashed.
 RIKER / Spread out... twenty five meter radius... our window back closes in nine minutes...
 WORF / Commander...
 WORF / Commander Riker...
 GEORDI / (yelling) COMMANDER RIKER... WORF... HEY UP THERE...
 WORF / Four minutes to beam-up, sir.
 RIKER / Where is he? Wait here...
 GEORDI / La Forge to Riker... La Forge to Worf... (yelling up again) HEY...
 RIKER / GEORDI... / 
 RIKER / (sharply) Lieutenant Worf, maintain your position.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43349.2. An unidentified distress signal has led to the discovery of a crashed Romulan vessel on the surface of Galorndon Core, a Federation planet.
 Much activity... the Romulan being examined by BEVERLY... MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARIES arriving with a / gurney...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) We have recovered one survivor. Lieutenant Commander La Forge did not report back with the away team and is still missing on the surface.
 BEVERLY / Get him to Sickbay.
 WORF / Secure Sickbay. Post guards in visual contact at all times.
 BEVERLY / He's not going anywhere, Lieutenant.
 RIKER / (controlled) Keep trying, Mister O'Brien.
 RIKER / (sharp) Then beam some of the ghosts up here... one of them may be La Forge. (sees Picard) Request permission to lead another away team...
 PICARD / Denied. (off his look) When we get another window in the storms.
 PICARD / The crash site?
 RIKER / The Romulan craft's a total loss. There's nothing there to salvage -- unless we do it with tweezers.
 PICARD / No sign of others...
 RIKER / (shakes his head) We could barely see two meters in front of us down there...
 PICARD / It certainly is the last place one would expect a Romulan encroachment. (speculating) On the other hand, Galorndon Core would provide ideal cover for an opening move of a new offensive.
 RIKER / (agrees) I doubt they were there for the climate.
 BEVERLY / We thought it would be like working on a Vulcan, but there are subtle differences... too many of them...
 PICARD / Can you treat him?
 BEVERLY / He has cell damage in vital areas... He's going to need a transfusion of compatible ribosomes in order to recover. I'm setting up a schedule to test every member of the crew.
 RIKER / Will he survive?
 BEVERLY / I can't answer that yet.
 RIKER / Let me put it another way -- will he survive long enough to tell us what he was doing here?
 PICARD / It is an important consideration, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / I can't put his life in any additional jeopardy...
 PICARD / Nor would we ask you to.
 BEVERLY / I can bring him around for a few minutes...
 BEVERLY / There is one serious complication. His brainwaves indicate early neural-pathway degeneration.
 RIKER / A head injury?
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head, no) There was no obvious cranial trauma. I'm guessing the exposure to the magnetic fields on the surface was slowly breaking down his synaptic connections.
 RIKER / Will it affect Geordi the same way?
 RIKER / You are aboard the Federation Starship Enterprise. (Patahk reacts) We are treating your injuries. How long were you on Galorndon Core? (he does not answer) Do you understand me?
 RIKER / We must know if there are any other survivors on the surface.
 RIKER / Is there a mother ship we should advise of your condition?
 PICARD / The only answer he offers is that he was alone...
 RIKER / ... which suggests he wasn't.
 RIKER / Something that can cut through the storm... to give us some way to signal him...
 WESLEY / A neutrino pulse...
 WESLEY / We could build a portable neutrino source and send it in a probe to the surface. It would be like a beacon.
 DATA / A neutrino pulse would send non-charged particles back up through the atmosphere... and would be detectable by Geordi's VISOR.
 WESLEY / He'll be able to show us that he's found it by modifying the pulse...
 PICARD / (nods to Wesley) Make it so.
 DATA / Captain, I have a new transmission on a parallel frequency to the distress call...
 PICARD / From the planet?
 DATA / No sir... from inside the Romulan Zone. We should be able to view the transmission.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, hail the Romulan vessel.
 WORF / Frequency open, sir.
 PICARD / Romulan vessel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 WORF / The frequency is open, sir.
 PICARD / Commander Tomalak, we have intercepted your transmission. You are not to enter Federation space.
 PICARD / (dry) Really...
 PICARD / A "slight" navigational error. Nearly half a light year past the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Commander, we have recovered one of your survivors.
 PICARD / We are treating him for severe injuries.
 PICARD / (pointed) Destroyed... deliberately... after the crash.
 PICARD / For all Romulan crews in enemy space... which would suggest they knew where they were, Commander.
 PICARD / He is not conscious... and not well enough to leave Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / Captain, with your permission...
 BEVERLY / I am Doctor Crusher, the medical officer. We are doing everything we can for him and it still may not be enough. Any medical guidance your ship's doctor can offer...
 PICARD / I have an away team on the surface. We are waiting for a window in the storm to beam them back.
 PICARD / Are there any other Romulans we should be looking to recover from Galorndon Core... ?
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / There is great hostility behind his smile, Captain. To complete his mission, he will stop at nothing.
 RIKER / Including the Neutral Zone border?
 WORF / Sir, I see no reason to return the Romulan to his ship. He should be held and interrogated.
 RIKER / We do have a right to detain him, Captain.
 PICARD / Without clear evidence of intent, it would not be a simple matter.
 RIKER / (disagreeing) This was obviously not pilot's error, Captain... it requires a response from us.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) We must measure the response carefully, Number One. Or history may remember Galorndon Core alongside Pearl Harbor and Station Salem-One... as the stage for a bloody preamble to war.
 GEORDI / What the hell... ?
 GEORDI / About five degrees off... huh. The water maybe... ?
 BEVERLY / I want him off all the drugs... they aren't doing anything... (keys insignia) Doctor Crusher to Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 BEVERLY / My patient is not responding to treatment.
 PICARD / You haven't found a compatible ribosome donor?
 BEVERLY / The lab is still processing the tests... early results indicate humans have far too many biorejection factors. I've also ruled out the Vulcans we've tested.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We'll try a little old-fashioned country medicine... keep the fever down, try to let the body heal itself...
 PICARD / Keep me advised. Picard out.
 WESLEY / Captain, the neutrino beacon is operational. We've placed it aboard a class three probe.
 PICARD / Well done, Ensign. (to Worf) Launch the probe.
 WORF / Probe has entered the atmosphere, sir.
 DATA / The neutrino stream is coming in strongly. Sensors are tracking the probe despite the interference.
 GEORDI / This better not be another malfunction...
 GEORDI (O.S.) / A stationary neutrino source...
 GEORDI / (smiles) Wesley Crusher.
 GEORDI / Right. Congratulations. Certainly, a strategic triumph for the Romulan Empire.
 GEORDI / My shoes are getting full of sand... I just hate that, don't you? You think we could just maybe move outta the...
 GEORDI / We just stopped by to rescue you, big fella... which I'm still willing to do if you'll put that down...
 GEORDI / Or we can just stand here and take in the view...
 GEORDI / Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge. I don't believe I caught yours... ?
 GEORDI / Uh, I really don't think that's gonna happen, Ensign... or is it Commodore... (a beat, Bochra doesn't react) Yeah, see... we heard your message too... and well, the fleet's in, Commodore. Sky's full of Federation ships.
 GEORDI / I never lie when I've got sand in my shoes, Commodore.
 GEORDI / Seriously. There's only one way out of here. Put that down and I'll take you back to my ship as soon as there's a window in the storm...
 GEORDI / You gotta be kidding.
 GEORDI / (to himself) Welcome to Galorndon Core, where no good deed goes unpunished...
 WORF / Yes, Doctor...
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant. Good. Come in. Please, sit down...
 BEVERLY / We've finally found a compatible ribosome match for the Romulan. But only one. You.
 WORF / That is impossible. I am a Klingon.
 BEVERLY / Different species, yes. But Humans, Romulans, Vulcans, Klingons, Betazoids -- we're all genetically similar. We have comparable cell structures. And you have what this Romulan needs. There's absolutely no risk to you...
 BEVERLY / You did understand that was the purpose of all the testing...
 WORF / I have no objection to tests.
 WORF / Yes.
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant, I understand your feelings about the Romulans. But this is not the time or place...
 WORF / If you had seen them kill your parents, you would understand, Doctor. It is always the time and place for those feelings.
 BEVERLY / This Romulan did not kill your parents. And you are the only one who can save his life.
 WORF / (beat) Then he will die.
 BEVERLY / I don't need him to like the idea, Captain... just to do it.
 PICARD / There is no alternative?
 BEVERLY / The alternative is the Romulan will die. Worf is quite correct on that point.
 PICARD / We need him alive... (beat) It is easy to forget that our Lieutenant Worf is not human. His values are very different from yours and mine.
 BEVERLY / Of course they are. But he is also an officer of Starfleet... and this is...
 PICARD / ... this is a personal matter...
 BEVERLY / It's very personal, Captain. Especially to the Romulan who's dying in my Sickbay. Maybe he has a family waiting for him to come home.
 BEVERLY / Worf is a good man. I know with a word of encouragement from you he will do the right thing.
 PICARD / (you mean) Order him.
 BEVERLY / Encourage him.
 PICARD / (uncomfortable) A captain's encouragement is difficult to refuse, Doctor. (beat) And difficult to offer to a man whose feelings run so deep.
 BEVERLY / Even if it means the life of the Romulan?
 PICARD / I must respect his personal views... even if I do not share them. He will have to live with the consequences of his decision.
 BEVERLY / We will all have to.
 GEORDI / I wish you'd put that away.
 GEORDI / ("are you stupid?") You bet I am. Who isn't?
 GEORDI / Right.
 GEORDI / Ah, the Romulan path to glory.
 GEORDI / (genuinely curious) You really believe that stuff, don't you, Commodore?
 GEORDI / Well, if you're that sure of yourselves, why be so tight-lipped? You won't even tell me your name.
 GEORDI / Why? Is it a military secret or something? I've told you mine. (shrugs) Okay, Commodore... whatever you say.
 GEORDI / Ahh. Bochra. Good, solid Romulan name. And you're a centurion. Well, stay with it, you'll be a commodore someday.
 GEORDI / What's the matter?
 GEORDI / Wrong. Your heart rate just shot way up.
 GEORDI / It translates a wide range of radiation into neural impulses. Allows me to see.
 GEORDI / Yes...
 GEORDI / I was born that way.
 GEORDI / What kind of question is that? Of course they let me live.
 GEORDI / Defective? Listen, Commodore -- I'm a chief engineer in Starfleet. You don't get there by being defective.
 GEORDI / I can see things you can't even imagine.
 GEORDI / Whoa...
 GEORDI / (to Bochra) I'm having some sort of polarity shift. The diagnostic insists everything's fine...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Your body temperature's gone up another full degree...
 GEORDI / It's this place... All that electromagnetic soup is playing hell with our nervous systems. Your metabolism's messed up... so's my interface with the VISOR.
 GEORDI / (continuing) We've got to get out of here while we still can.
 GEORDI / Bochra...
 RIKER / What's that?
 WESLEY / Just a background fluctuation, Commander... he hasn't found it yet.
 RIKER / Then he must be hurt... or dead. (beat) How long before another window, Data?
 DATA / There are none indicated, Commander. I have no way to predict.
 WORF / Incoming Romulan transmission, Captain.
 RIKER / They're early.
 DATA / (agrees) The Romulan warbird should still be twenty-nine minutes away from the edge of the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Close enough, however, to see we're not there. (to Worf) On screen.
 PICARD / My away team has not been able to leave the surface because of the storms.
 PICARD / He is alive.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / If the point hasn't been made clearly, Commander, let me make it again. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Romulan warships do not enter Federation space unless they are prepared to do battle.
 PICARD / A mission to recover one of your officers who was caught on a Federation planet. For reasons still unknown...
 PICARD / And I have rejected your explanation.
 PICARD / Commander, your singular concern for a life is impressive. Do not risk any more lives by leaving the Neutral Zone. Picard out.
 GEORDI / Bochra, you're in bad shape.
 GEORDI / My vision's getting worse. There's a beacon out there... it'll get us back to my ship... but not if I can't find it.
 GEORDI / Then stay here and die.
 GEORDI / I don't know. I might... if I thought it was necessary. If the stakes were high enough. (a beat) But they'd have to be pretty damn high.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Guess I'd make a pretty lousy Romulan, huh... ?
 GEORDI / (a smile) You mean Romulans aren't always ready to sacrifice themselves on command?
 GEORDI / Bochra -- there are times when dying for one's ideals is necessary. (a beat) Do you believe this is one of those times?
 GEORDI / Let's find that beacon.
 GEORDI / Everything's gone blank. (a beat) I'm blind.
 RIKER'S VOICE / Come.
 WORF / You are busy. Forgive my intrusion.
 RIKER / For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness.
 WORF / With respect, sir... you cannot. (beat) I am asked to give up the very lifeblood of my mother, of my father, to those who murdered them.
 RIKER / Must you blame all Romulans for that?
 WORF / Yes.
 RIKER / Forever, Worf? (Worf thinks deeply) What if the Federation should make peace with the Romulans someday...
 WORF / Impossible.
 RIKER / Not long ago, your people said the same thing about humans.
 RIKER / And so many on both sides died in that war. How could you and I be here now... like this... if we were unable to let go of the anger, the blame. (beat) When does it end, Worf? If the Romulan dies, does his family carry the bitterness forward another generation?
 WORF / Then you believe I should.
 RIKER / What I believe doesn't matter.
 WORF / My Starfleet training tells me one thing. Everything I am tells me another.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay.
 WORF / Acknowledged.
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant, his life is coming to an end. I thought it important for you to see him again.
 BEVERLY / It is not too late to change your mind.
 WORF / I am the only one who can keep you alive.
 WORF / There is a substance within my cells which you need to survive...
 WORF / (beat) No.
 GEORDI / My synapses must be turning to jelly. The VISOR's fine, but I can't see a thing.
 GEORDI / We don't.
 GEORDI / Are all Romulans so pushy? Bochra, we're lost... unless you've got something that can smell neutrinos.
 GEORDI / My tricorder? It isn't set up to detect neutrinos.
 GEORDI / That's crazy. They don't speak the same language. I'd never get an accurate sampling... (stops; maybe it's not so crazy) But, then, I don't need an accurate sampling. I just need a pointer... a neutrino Geiger counter.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Still not possible.
 GEORDI / Under normal circumstances, maybe. Here, no way.
 GEORDI / Because I can't see. Adapting the neural output pods of the VISOR is tricky work. It can't be done by "touch."
 DATA / The storm is beginning to subside, Captain... we should have a window in less than an hour...
 RIKER / Still no indication he's found the beacon, sir...
 PICARD / (to Riker) Assemble an away team...
 RIKER / (moving with purpose) Yes, sir...
 WORF / (interrupting) Captain... the Romulan warship has crossed the Neutral Zone border. It is in Federation space and heading toward us.
 PICARD / Stand by, Number One. (quietly) Red Alert.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / ... make sure the scan select limiter matches the VISOR output range.
 GEORDI / Now close the case and place the neural output pods in contact with the tricorder scanner heads.
 GEORDI / Let her rip.
 GEORDI / We did it! The first Federation-Romulan co-venture.
 GEORDI / With any luck an electromagnetic window will be opening up and we can get out of here.
 GEORDI / Can you walk?
 WORF / You wished to see me, Captain.
 PICARD / Yes, Lieutenant. (a beat) I assume you know what this is about...
 PICARD / The Romulan ship will reach us within the hour, Lieutenant. If our patient dies... it may be just the excuse the Romulan commander needs to start an incident. The death of a Romulan officer at the hands of the Federation! Think of it.
 WORF / I have, Captain.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) There is no question that this Romulan is more valuable to us alive than dead, Lieutenant.
 WORF / I understand.
 PICARD / Sometimes the moral obligations of command are less than clear. I weigh the good of the many against the needs of the individual... and try to balance them as realistically as possible. God knows I don't always succeed.
 WORF / I have not had cause to complain, Captain.
 PICARD / (with appreciation) You wouldn't complain even if you had cause, Lieutenant.
 WORF / If you order me to agree to the transfusion, I will, of course, obey.
 PICARD / I cannot order you. I will not order you, Lieutenant. But I ask you. I beg you to volunteer.
 WORF / (a beat) I cannot, Captain.
 PICARD / Lieutenant...
 WORF / Sir?
 PICARD / Dismissed.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Picard to Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 PICARD / Do not continue to enlist Lieutenant Worf's assistance.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I won't have to, Captain. The Romulan has died.
 GEORDI / Now we have to change its signal pattern so the Enterprise knows we've found it.
 GEORDI / Not with your help.
 DATA / Scanners show a window, Captain.
 PICARD / Estimated duration?
 DATA / Nine minutes, forty seconds.
 WESLEY / No change in the neutrino beacon signal, sir.
 WORF / Romulan ship approaching. Bearing three-fifty-four mark two-eight-seven.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF (O.S.) / Romulan is entering phaser range.
 WORF / We are being hailed, sir.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / (equally hard) You have entered Federation space despite my warning, Commander.
 PICARD / He is dead.
 WORF / The Romulan ship is routing power to its forward disruptor array.
 PICARD / All shields to maximum.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Lock phasers on target.
 WORF / Phasers locked and ready.
 WESLEY / Captain -- the signal pattern from the neutrino beacon is modulating.
 TROI / Geordi!
 RIKER / We can't transport him with our shields up.
 WORF / If we lower our shields, the Romulan will strike.
 DATA / The electromagnetic window on the planet is closing. Three minutes remain.
 PICARD / Transporter Room. Lock onto the coordinates of the neutrino beacon and stand by.
 DATA / Captain, the window is allowing intermittant sensor readings... There are still numerous ghost images, but I believe we are picking up two life forms near the beacon...
 RIKER / Another Romulan?
 DATA / I cannot say. The electromagnetic interference prevents an accurate reading.
 PICARD / (mind racing) But it is a likely hypothesis, Number One. If Mister La Forge located a second survivor... (to Worf) Hail the Romulan ship, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Aye, sir. (does so) They're ignoring our hail, sir.
 PICARD / Repeat the hail -- all channels. (to Riker) He has no way of knowing how accurate our sensors are... put on your poker face, Number One... (to Worf) Open frequency.
 PICARD / Commander Tomalak. It would appear our away team has rescued a second man from your one man ship.
 PICARD / They are on the surface, ready to beam up. We are preparing to do so. (beat, a decision) After which we will return the survivor to you.
 WORF / No acknowledgement, Captain.
 PICARD / Commander, both our ships are ready to fight. We have two supremely powerful, destructive arsenals at our command. Our next actions will have serious repercussions for both sides. (a beat) We have good reason to mistrust one another, Commander, but we have better reasons to set our differences aside. The question, of course, is who will show vulnerability first. (a beat) The answer is -- I will. I must lower my shields to transport these men off the planet surface.
 PICARD / Once the shields are down, you will have an opportunity to open fire. If you do, you will not only destroy the Enterprise and its crew -- but also the cease-fire that the Romulans and the Federation now enjoy.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, lower the shields. Leave hailing frequencies open.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Mister O'Brien. Transport Mister La Forge and the Romulan directly to the bridge.
 WORF / Security team to bridge.
 PICARD / Belay that order, Lieutenant. Shields up. (to Bochra) No one is going to harm you.
 GEORDI / (to Bochra) You have my word.
 PICARD / Well, Commander?
 PICARD / Commander, how is it possible you didn't know of this second Romulan on Galorndon Core?
 PICARD / Of course not.
 PICARD / Let's just say my faith would be strengthened with a gesture -- such as powering down your disruptors.
 WORF / Disruptors powering down, Captain.
 PICARD / Thank you. Cancel Red Alert, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / (continuing) We will return your officer and escort your ship back to the Neutral Zone, Commander.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, it's good to have you back.
 GEORDI / (looking at him) I have Centurion Bochra to thank, sir.
 GEORDI / Yeah, gradually. Your heart rate's slowing down.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, Mister Worf -- escort our guest to Transporter Room One.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Close call.
 PICARD / Too close, Number One. Brinksmanship is a dangerous game...
 BEVERLY / It was not in my power to save him.
 GEORDI / (returns the nod) Centurion Bochra.
 GEORDI / That's okay; you're not what I expected of a Romulan, either. (with a grin) That's a compliment.
 GEORDI / That's the way to fight all the wars from now on. Two guys on a planet with no one else to talk to and nowhere to go. Things get settled in a hurry.
 GEORDI / (leaving) I'm gonna sleep for four days...
 TROI / Maybe you should come in with her and talk about it together.
 TROI / Sure you could. Why don't I make another appointment for you...
 WESLEY / Counselor Troi... ?
 TROI / Yes, Wesley...
 WESLEY / Can I talk to you a minute... I have a real problem with my mother.
 WESLEY (O.S.) / She's being completely unreasonable... see there's a party on Holodeck Four tonight... and all the other kids are staying overnight... well, most of them and...
 TROI / Computer, dispatches...
 TROI / (reacts, three?) Transfer my mother's letters to my viewer... (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / (beat) ... and computer, I'd like a... a real chocolate sundae.
 TROI / Real... not one of your perfectly synthesized, ingeniously enhanced imitations... real chocolate ice cream, real whipped cream...
 TROI / Listen, computer...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Counselor Troi.
 TROI / (frowns, to herself) Now what? (keys insignia) Yes, Captain?
 A casual party in progress... PICARD, WORF, RIKER, DATA. / 
 In the background, MENDOZA, a Federation negotiator, chats with several aliens including BHAVANI, the leader of Barzan, and LEYOR, the Caldonian representative. PICARD is smiling, jovial. A WAITER refills his / champagne glass and not for the first time.
 PICARD / The pleasure of your company is requested, Counselor. We're having an impromptu reception for the arriving delegates.
 TROI / (reacts, not tonight) Captain, I'm not dressed for a reception...
 PICARD / Oh, just throw on any old thing. We're about to get our first look at the wormhole.
 TROI / Of course, Captain. I'm on my way. Troi out.
 TROI / (to herself) God forbid, I should miss the first look at the wormhole.
 GEORDI and BEVERLY have joined the fun now too... / waiters serve hors d'ouevres... Troi ENTERS, smiling, serene, our Troi... Riker goes to meet her... offers an arm...
 RIKER / May I escort you in, Miss Troi...
 TROI / Just tell me there's some chocolate here...
 PICARD / Ah, Counselor Troi... allow me to do the introductions... Premier Bhavani of the Barzan...
 TROI / Your discovery has certainly produced a great deal of excitement, Premier.
 PICARD / You know Mister Mendoza, the Federation negotiator...
 PICARD / One of the Federation's worthy competitors in the bidding, Leyor of the Caldonians.
 TROI / Ship's Counselor Deanna Troi.
 TROI / Hired gun?
 PICARD / Indeed. It will be visible directly ahead...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43385.7. We are in orbit around Barzan, a planet which is entertaining bids for control of what appears to be a most unique, stable wormhole. It could conceivably provide a permanent shortcut within our galaxy.
 RIKER / Excuse me, a delegation of... Ferengi... wishes to be beamed aboard...
 PICARD / You were not expecting the Ferengi, Premier... ?
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Chief O'Brien, this is Picard. Beam the Ferengi directly to the observation lounge.
 PICARD / DaiMon, I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise... I'm serving as host for these proceedings...
 PICARD / (with an edge) Perhaps you misunderstood...
 WORF / (pointed) I am in charge of security.
 PICARD / DaiMon, due to the intimate nature of these negotiations, all parties agreed that one representative would suffice. I will be happy to provide your consuls with accommodations... and you may have my chair...
 TROI / Computer... show me the file on delegate Devinoni Ral...
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / No... I... was just looking over some personnel files...
 TROI / I thought you'd be deep into negotiations by now...
 TROI / What about your... traveling companion?
 TROI / Why?
 TROI / Weren't you getting along?
 TROI / What?
 TROI / Was I?
 TROI / What are you...
 DATA / The data from the Barzan's probe into the wormhole is impressive, Captain. The wormhole delivered the probe beyond the Denkiri Arm, in the Gamma Quadrant.
 PICARD / It would take us nearly a century at warp nine to cross that distance...
 DATA / The same distance could be achieved in a matter of seconds through the wormhole.
 RIKER / I was just imagining the Ferengi collecting tolls in front if we lose to them...
 RIKER / I'd say that fellow Devinoni's the one to watch out for...
 RIKER / He's the most comfortable man in the group...
 RIKER / (grin) Poker, isn't that a game of some sort?
 PICARD / Commander Riker teaches poker.
 PICARD / Mister Mendoza, if this lives up to its billing... it is a discovery of extraordinary value... but it is a big "if"...
 RIKER / Wormholes are here one moment, gone the next... a stable wormhole is unheard of.
 DATA / The Barzans do not have manned space travel, so they had to resort to an automated probe. Its findings are limited. It cannot be determined from these charts how stable the wormhole really is or how long it will remain intact.
 PICARD / The Federation could wind up "buying" itself the proverbial lemon, Mister Mendoza.
 RIKER / We really ought to see for ourselves.
 RIKER / Geordi has continuous visual contact with the wormhole, Captain. He's the logical choice...
 DATA / I would also like to volunteer, Captain...
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Before anyone goes in there, we're going to conduct a full sensor analysis. I want to do everything possible to determine that it's safe. (beat) If we're satisfied, Data, you and Commander La Forge will enter the wormhole tommorrow.
 TROI / Thank you. Come in for a drink?
 TROI / Not your style?
 TROI / What would you like?
 TROI / I am not... computer, champagne...
 TROI / No, I'm moving too fast for me.
 TROI / (and now she looks at him) I haven't been able to stop thinking about you all day...
 TROI / Anticipation is fun.
 TROI / We'll be late for dinner.
 BEVERLY / Mister Mendoza?
 BEVERLY / I need some help here...
 PICARD / Premier Bhavani has no objection...
 PICARD / We will gladly share the results of our exploration with all the delegates...
 RIKER / Then send in your own probe, Goss.
 PICARD / Tell Data and La Forge to do themselves a favor and stay out of their way.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard, please come to Sickbay...
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Acknowledged, Doctor.
 Mendoza is unconscious on a diagnostic bed. Two MEDICAL ASSISTANTS tend to him. / 
 BEVERLY is working a computer, and not getting / satisfaction from its readout. Picard and Riker stand over Mendoza's bed. Picard shakes his head at what seems an unfortunate turn of events.
 BEVERLY / Whatever he's got is obviously not life threatening -- it's some kind of system-wide histaminic reaction. He certainly can't go back to the negotiations for several days.
 PICARD / (a beat) Keep us advised.
 PICARD / The Federation's top negotiator taken out by a mysterious ailment. Suspicions?
 RIKER / With the Ferengi around, always.
 PICARD / Well, I guess you'll have to fill in for him, Number One.
 RIKER / Me?
 PICARD / I am the designated host. It would be a most awkward transition. The next likely choice is you. Mister Mendoza would agree. He was quite impressed with your natural instincts.
 RIKER / Excuse me, sir, but those weren't natural instincts... they're poker instincts... A parlor game doesn't exactly prepare me for this...
 PICARD / Yes, the stakes are higher. But then... that's when the game gets interesting, doesn't it, Commander.
 WESLEY / The wormhole will reappear in thirty seconds.
 PICARD / Shuttle nine, stand by...
 WORF / Ferengi pod is moving into position, Captain...
 GEORDI / (transmitting) Ferengi pod, this is Lieutenant Commander La Forge in the Enterprise shuttle.
 GEORDI / Would you care to take the point, Doctor?
 PICARD / Proceed when ready.
 WORF / Contact with the shuttle, sir.
 PICARD / Pipe it in, Lieutenant.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Captain, we have penetrated the outer event horizon of the wormhole. Sensors read severe doppler shifts... (distorted)
 WESLEY / It's the relativistic time dilation, sir. Time is moving more slowly inside their part of the wormhole. I can process the audio to compensate...
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / ... and intense energy fields which appear to be stabilizing the wormhole. It is not clear why... Now approaching the singularity...
 WESLEY / They've passed beyond our communication capabilities, sir...
 RIKER / I think I have an idea what the rules are.
 RIKER / In that regard, it's not unlike commanding a starship, Mister Ral.
 RIKER / A complete analysis of our bid is available on the ship's computer for your consideration, Premier... If I may summarize...
 RIKER / Our proposal includes technology that will enhance your food production, your mining capabilities, and space travel.
 RIKER (O.S.) / (continuing) We offer scholars and scientists to investigate the wormhole's potential. And perhaps most critical of all, we offer Starfleet. The security of this passage must never be compromised. We offer protection of the wormhole in perpetuity.
 RIKER / Neutral. And uninvolved, sir, in virtually all interstellar matters of consequence.
 TROI (O.S.) / Mmmm?
 TROI (O.S.) / Mmmm.
 TROI (O.S.) / (yes) Mmm-hmmm.
 TROI / Devinoni Ral, who are you?
 TROI / Not very much... (smiles) My human physical response must be blocking them out.
 TROI / It's never happened before.
 TROI / I don't have any others... currently.
 TROI / Who have you been talking to... ?
 TROI / (reinstates the mood) Will Riker and I are good friends.
 TROI / It was once a little more than that.
 TROI / And how come we're talking about me and not you?
 TROI / Uh uh, I want to know about you now...
 TROI / When I first saw you, I felt as if I'd been waiting for you. I've been trying to understand why or how that's possible.
 TROI / What?
 TROI / You're empathic?
 TROI / That's why you left Earth...
 GEORDI / I'm picking up an increase in accretion matter filtering in from the terminus.
 GEORDI / We made it...
 DATA / Monitors are functioning normally again.
 GEORDI / (to com) Ferengi pod, everybody in one piece over there?
 GEORDI / (to himself) Happy landings to you too.
 DATA / (re: readings) Curious.
 GEORDI / Huh?
 DATA / We are not where we are supposed to be.
 GEORDI / What do you mean... we're on the other side of the wormhole, aren't we... ?
 DATA / According to the Barzan probe, we should be in the Gamma Quadrant... but the readings clearly indicate we are nearly two hundred light years away. In sector three-five-five-six of the Delta Quadrant.
 GEORDI / Maybe the Barzan's readings were wrong...
 DATA / Maybe their readings were correct. Their probe could have exited the wormhole at a different location.
 GEORDI / Data, I'm picking up a subatomic fluctuation... meson and lepton activity is increasing...
 DATA / Gravitational acceleration is also increasing...
 GEORDI / Something very strange is happening to this wormhole.
 TROI / Sorry.
 BEVERLY / You're unusually "limber" this morning.
 TROI / (smiles) I'll say.
 BEVERLY / Uh huh... ?
 TROI / Devinoni Ral.
 TROI / It's ridiculous. And wonderful. I feel... completely out of control. Happy. Terrified. There's nothing rational about this.
 BEVERLY / Who needs rational when your toes curl up... ?
 TROI / I'm afraid I'm going to lose myself... I can't get enough of him. Is it possible to fall in love in one day?
 BEVERLY / I did.
 TROI / It was like this for you and Jack?
 BEVERLY / No, it was another fellow. Fell in love in a day. It lasted a week. But what a week. (beat, remembers) Then I met Jack... took months to figure it out with Jack.
 TROI / Maybe I should slow down... catch my breath, not let this get out of control...
 BEVERLY & TROI / Nah.
 RIKER / Leyor, the Federation would like to negotiate a trade agreement to acquire your planet's rich deposits of Trillium 323 which we will add to our bid, Premier Bhavani...
 RIKER / Mister Ral, you either had very good instincts -- or foreknowledge of the Caldonian withdrawal.
 GEORDI / I'm telling you, it's changing... Look, your readings must be showing you the same things we're getting... this is not the Gamma Quadrant.
 DATA / It is not a speculation, Doctor. We are not where the Barzans said we should be... which would indicate that this side of the wormhole is not stable.
 GEORDI / There are meson and lepton fluctuations... local gravitational fields are increasing exponentially... everything says we better get the hell out of here...
 GEORDI / I can see it now... and I'm telling you that you don't have time to wait... not even forty seconds...
 GEORDI / Dammit, Arridor, we're seventy thousand light years away from our ships... follow us... we'll lead you in...
 GEORDI / Idiots.
 GEORDI / It's getting worse. I'm taking us in, Data... with or without them...
 DATA / Thrusters at half power... three-quarters...
 GEORDI / Entering outer event horizon...
 TROI / Everyone's talking about the way you absorbed the Caldonian bid today...
 TROI / Commander Riker didn't know how you managed it...
 TROI / ... he just doesn't have an edge. Your edge.
 TROI / Isn't it?
 TROI / (beat) Why haven't you told anyone that you're an empath?
 TROI / I think you don't tell them... so you can gain an advantage.
 TROI / But you're reading their emotional states, their inner selves, then using that to manipulate them.
 TROI / I do it to help my crew, not outmanueuver them. And I don't hide that I'm an empath.
 TROI / That's different. It's a matter of protection...
 RIKER / Bought out the Ferengi yet, Ral?
 RIKER / No. But I think you will. One way or another, it'll come down to you and me.
 RIKER / I hope I'm better than you realize, Ral.
 RIKER / We'll see, won't we...
 RIKER / Your point of view, not mine.
 RIKER / I'll remove the burden of that responsibility right now. My relationship with Deanna stands on its own. Without help from you.
 RIKER / You know, I think this is the first bad play I've seen you make...
 RIKER / If you bring happiness into Deanna's life, nothing would please me more. You're not really a bad sort, Ral, you just don't have any values... beyond the value of today's bid, that is. She's just the one to give some meaning to your sorry existence... if you're smart enough to take it. I doubt that you are.
 RIKER / To the last mile.
 WORF / Sir, the Ferengi vessel is moving out of orbit, impulse power... (beat) They are approaching the entry to the wormhole, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) Computer, is the Ferengi Goss still aboard the Enterprise?
 WORF / Ferengi are powering forward missile launchers...
 PICARD / Yellow Alert. Hail the Ferengi.
 WORF / DaiMon Goss responding.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Request an explanation for your actions, DaiMon Goss.
 PICARD / That is not true...
 PICARD / Premier Bhavani welcomed you to these proceedings, Goss... despite my better judgment...
 WORF / They've fired a missile directly at the opening, sir!
 PICARD / Destroy it.
 WORF / Firing phasers.
 RIKER / Riker to Picard. What's happening, Captain?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Goss has fired a missile at the wormhole... I need you on the bridge, Number One...
 RIKER / (on the move) Excuse me.
 PICARD / (to viewscreen) You must know we will not allow you to do this, Goss.
 PICARD / Can he possibly believe that a missile will have any destructive effect on a wormhole?
 RIKER / One of those missiles would have a destructive effect if it exploded near our shuttle...
 RIKER / Goss... don't you realize we both have shuttlecraft in there?
 TROI / Captain...
 PICARD / (off her look) Viewscreen off.
 TROI / He's lying. I'm almost sure of it. He does not mean what he says.
 RIKER / Why... what is he doing it for then?
 PICARD / Premier, with all due respect...
 WORF / Ferengi vessel has shut down forward missile launchers.
 PICARD / Stand down, Red Alert.
 TROI / Excuse me, Premier. There is something you should know...
 TROI / I'm sorry, was there something you wanted to say, Mister Ral?
 TROI / I sense you are uncomfortable suddenly...
 TROI / But that's what is so odd about it... it was not tense at all... I sensed no tension from DaiMon Goss... or you...
 PICARD / (enough already) Off screen.
 TROI / It was almost as though... you both were performing a scene for all of us...
 TROI / I agree. Entirely. Devinoni asked me not to tell anyone about his empathic powers... which he uses to manipulate competitors in a negotiation.
 TROI / Certainly, that put me in a conflict of interest which I hope I have now resolved. Premier, I believe Ral has used your fear of continuing aggression between the Federation and its enemies to undermine our position. I also believe this incident was staged by Ral and Goss to provide you with a reason to decide in favor of the Chrysalians.
 WESLEY / (excited) Captain...
 PICARD / (knows by the sound in his voice) On speaker.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Shuttle nine to Enterprise... Shuttle nine to Enterprise...
 PICARD / Shuttle, this is Picard... do you read... (no response) On screen...
 GEORDI / This is Shuttle nine... reporting back... barely.
 PICARD / The Ferengi pod?
 GEORDI / They're trapped on the other side, sir. In the Delta Quadrant. We tried to warn them. They wouldn't follow us.
 PICARD / Elaborate.
 DATA / Captain, this end of the wormhole is currently stable but the other end apparently shifts position periodically. The Barzan probe had no way to recognize this. Eventually, both sides will be unstable.
 GEORDI / It's a dry well, Captain. Worthless.
 PICARD / Acknowledged, Shuttle nine. Main Shuttlebay, prepare for final approach.
 WORF / Captain, DaiMon Goss is demanding to know where his men are.
 PICARD / Advise him to set his coordinates for the Delta Quadrant, Lieutenant... He might run into them in eighty years or so.
 RIKER / Mister Ral, I congratulate you on winning the rights to the Barzan wormhole...
 TROI / Come in...
 TROI / When do you leave?
 TROI / I'm sorry.
 TROI / You must have known that I couldn't allow you to do that...
 TROI / I already have a job as a counselor.
 RIKER, WORF, BEVERLY, and DATA MATERIALIZE and survey / the damage.
 RIKER / Someone sure stripped this place.
 WORF / The reactor is gone.
 RIKER / That's why no one answered our hail for two days -- they had nothing to answer it with.
 DATA / Life signs five meters straight ahead, Commander.
 RIKER / Blood?
 BEVERLY / Yes, but not human. I'll have to do some analysis on it.
 WORF / It's jammed.
 MEDICS are tending to the two scientists. Beverly's / analyzing the bloody piece of metal. Picard, Riker and Data ENTER. Beverly reports:
 BEVERLY / The two scientists are suffering from phaser stuns... I'd guess several hits each.
 PICARD / Several... when one would surely have sufficed.
 BEVERLY / It'll take us a while to bring them around, but they'll recover.
 BEVERLY (cont'd) / We found a sample of blood. It's a rare iron-copper composite, unique to one humanoid species: the Acamarians.
 PICARD / Acamarians. (a beat) That would suggest... the Gatherers.
 DATA / A likely hypothesis. The nomadic marauders who refer to themselves as Gatherers have raided other outposts in neighboring sectors.
 RIKER / But they've never ventured this far before.
 PICARD / And we cannot permit them to spread their violent ways further. (keys insignia) Mister Crusher, set course for the Acamar system.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43562.9. In an effort to put an end to the Gatherer raids, we have come to the Acamar System to enlist the aid of Marouk, the sovereign of Acamar Three.
 PICARD / Their raids have made this sector unsafe. Our research facilities have been ransacked; trade routes disrupted...
 PICARD / Hunting them down is not what I'm proposing.
 TROI / When was the last attempt made?
 PICARD / (surprised) Eighteen years?
 RIKER / Why?
 PICARD / They are still your people.
 TROI / After a century of wandering, they may be ready to come home.
 PICARD / Despite all your progress, your society is still divided. And it will remain so until the Gatherers return to Acamar.
 PICARD / You have much to gain and little to lose in making the effort. The problem affects us all... it cannot be ignored.
 PICARD / Sovereign Marouk, how soon will you be ready to leave Acamar?
 RIKER / I'll see to that... and to your accommodations, Sovereign.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / The Federation has charted but not explored several Class M planets in that area. Any of those planets might well serve as a base.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, set course for the Hromi Cluster.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / We're very proud of her.
 RIKER / You're the chef?
 RIKER / We can provide you with a kitchen if you wish... but it's not really necessary. The food dispensers can synthesize anything you want.
 RIKER (cont'd) / I'll show you. (to Marouk) Sovereign, may I offer you a drink?
 RIKER / (to food slot) A glass of water... five degrees.
 RIKER / You're also the food taster?
 RIKER / I'll arrange for a technician to help you program your recipes into the computer. I'd like to try some myself. What's your specialty?
 RIKER / Don't be modest. You can't tell me you haven't come up with a few original triumphs...
 RIKER / "Parthus?"
 RIKER / Ah. Parthus... a la Yuta. I look forward to tasting it. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (to Marouk, taking his leave) Sovereign...
 RIKER (cont'd) / Chef...
 WESLEY / Entering standard orbit of Gamma Hromi Two, sir.
 DATA / I am detecting life readings on the surface, sir... and several small areas of heat and carbon dioxide emission indicative of combustion.
 WESLEY / Campfires, Data.
 RIKER / (to Picard) It's worth a look.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 GEORDI / Artonian lasers, Tonkian homing beacons... quite a collection.
 DATA / Noranium alloys. Their salvage value is low.
 RIKER / Looks like the Gatherers aren't very discriminating in what they steal.
 WORF / The spoils of animals without honor.
 WORF (cont'd) / Commander.
 WORF / Ambush!
 DATA / Rigellian phaser rifles. Not very powerful.
 RIKER / Powerful enough...
 RIKER / We want to talk --
 WORF / Your words are wasted, Commander. (holding up his phaser) They understand only this.
 RIKER / (convincing himself as well) We're here to establish a dialogue.
 RIKER / Data... noranium vaporizes at... ?
 DATA / Two thousand three hundred fourteen degrees. Of course, noranium carbide alloys vaporize at a slightly higher temperature.
 GEORDI / Phaser setting seven ought to do it...
 RIKER / Now!
 RIKER (O.S.) / Enterprise -- four to beam up! Energize!
 WORF / (to Brull) Your ambushes would be more successful if you bathed more often.
 RIKER / We've brought the sovereign of Acamar...
 RIKER / (nods) With an offer of amnesty.
 PICARD / Sovereign...
 PICARD / Brull...
 PICARD / Sit down.
 PICARD / We are here to talk.
 PICARD / She is here, isn't she, Brull?
 RIKER / Any insights, Counselor?
 TROI / Brull's ready to negotiate. He wants privacy so he won't appear weak in the presence of the other Gatherers.
 PICARD / (trying to pin him down) But you agree it's worth presenting to your leader.
 PICARD / Brull, in twenty days, I hope to be... very far away from here.
 PICARD / We will gladly take you with us aboard the Enterprise. It will give you a chance to enjoy Federation hospitality. How many of your men do you want to accompany you?
 RIKER / Away team to Enterprise. Medical Emergency.
 RIKER / There's a chance our doctors can do something...
 BEVERLY / He's been dead too long.
 RIKER / How?
 BEVERLY / Cardiac arrest...
 RIKER / You don't sound convinced.
 BEVERLY / No, it was a heart attack, all right. But I can't figure out what caused it. Cardiac muscle is strong... no sign of arterial occlusion...
 PICARD / Is there anything you need to bring with you, Brull?
 PICARD / Anything... a change of clothes, perhaps...
 PICARD / Very well then... (keys insignia) Picard to Enterprise... two...
 PICARD / (acknowledges, naturally) Two to beam up...
 PICARD / Brull -- show Mister Crusher the course to plot.
 PICARD / (pointedly) That "child" is one of the finest ensigns under my command. He also happens to pilot this ship.
 WESLEY / This is our present position.
 WESLEY / That'll take us through the center of an asteroid belt.
 WESLEY / (mildly) Sure I can. But if we take this heading... (punches it in) (MORE)
 WESLEY (Cont'd) / ... we avoid the belt entirely, and we only lose twelve point one minutes at warp seven.
 PICARD / And these blood feuds could last for decades?
 PICARD / It's not unlike the history of my own planet, Marouk.
 WESLEY / My studies.
 WESLEY / Math.
 WESLEY / It's the locally Euclidean metrization of a k-fold contravariant Riemannian tensor field.
 WESLEY / I didn't say --
 WESLEY / You're a thief.
 WESLEY / (curious) But you're helping Sovereign Marouk to change all that...
 WESLEY / You have children?
 RIKER / Parthus a la Yuta?
 TROI / It's wonderful.
 RIKER / Truly excellent.
 RIKER / Will you join us?
 TROI / Not at all; I was just about to leave. Please -- sit down.
 RIKER / It really is delicious.
 RIKER / I'm not your commander. My name is William.
 RIKER / I do. You say "Commander" to me the same way you say "Sovereign" to Marouk.
 RIKER / Why's that? Not that I disagree...
 RIKER / No. I prefer the company of equals.
 RIKER / And you're not comfortable with that?
 RIKER / What about freedom?
 RIKER / You're the property of the sovereign?
 RIKER / (a guess) But you have no place to go?
 RIKER / Yuta, you're an excellent cook, but you talk in riddles.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Sickbay to Commander Riker. I've discovered something interesting, Will...
 RIKER / I'll be right there...
 RIKER / Doctor, you're scowling.
 BEVERLY / I'm thinking.
 RIKER / And?
 BEVERLY / The old Gatherer on the planet? I've found what caused his heart attack.
 BEVERLY (cont'd) / The medical tricorder almost missed it, but there was a microvirus in his body... it attached to parasympathetic nerves and acted as a cholinesterase inhibitor, blocking autonomic nerve impulses.
 RIKER / And that stopped his heart?
 BEVERLY / (nods) But here's the interesting part. The microvirus will only attach to cells which contain a very specific DNA sequence.
 RIKER / How specific?
 BEVERLY / Without knowing more about their genetic makeup, I can't be sure... but my guess is, this virus would only kill one Acamarian in a million.
 RIKER / That's an awfully single-minded bug.
 BEVERLY / Too single-minded. I can't believe it's a naturally occurring virus.
 RIKER / Meaning somebody engineered it...
 BEVERLY / Meaning Volnoth was murdered.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Sir, Acamar Three has agreed to your request for access to its databases. They are now transmitting them to our computer over subspace link.
 RIKER / Good. Notify Doctor Crusher when Acamar's medical database is online. Riker out.
 RIKER (cont'd) / Come in.
 RIKER / Not at all.
 RIKER / What a charming suggestion...
 RIKER / Was it so obvious...
 RIKER / (joking) Well, I've already dined... but, maybe you know a good Acamarian dessert recipe.
 RIKER / You've got the night off, remember?
 RIKER / (pulling away) Not as a servant. I told you... I prefer equals.
 RIKER / Especially in matters of love.
 RIKER / No.
 RIKER / I only want to make you as happy as you want to make me. You're entitled to that...
 RIKER / (reacts) Yuta...
 RIKER / I don't know who did this to you or why... but it can change.
 PICARD / Your people have provided a warm welcome.
 WORF / Shields holding.
 PICARD / (indicating Worf's station) Worf -- contact Chorgan and tell him Brull has brought us here to talk.
 WORF / Chorgan's not responding.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, can we knock out their shields without seriously damaging their ship?
 WORF / I believe we can, sir.
 PICARD / Prepare phasers and open channel...
 WORF / Phasers locked. Channel open, Captain.
 PICARD / This is Jean-Luc Picard...
 PICARD / (to himself) Let's focus their attention. (to Worf) Fire.
 WORF / Their forward shields are inoperative.
 PICARD / Well done, Lieutenant.
 WORF / They're hailing us, sir.
 PICARD / That's better. (to Worf) On screen.
 PICARD / Chorgan, if I had wanted you destroyed, you wouldn't be talking now.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Obviously, I want something else.
 PICARD / I have on board Sovereign Marouk of Acamar Three. I want you to hear what she and Brull have to say.
 PICARD / (with finality) You have no choice. Prepare to receive us -- we're coming aboard your ship. Picard out.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Cancel Red Alert. Have Sovereign Marouk meet me in Transporter Three.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / You're going alone, Captain?
 PICARD / The danger is minimal, Number One. Chorgan's not likely to do anything rash while the Enterprise's phasers are trained upon his ship.
 RIKER / It's still a risk.
 PICARD / For these negotiations to succeed, I must be a mediator -- not an enforcer.
 PICARD (cont'd) / You have the bridge, Number One.
 PICARD / Chorgan. May I introduce Sovereign Marouk.
 PICARD / (to Chorgan) I think you will find Marouk's proposal --
 PICARD / Then let's proceed.
 PICARD / She's trying to put an end to that.
 PICARD / Let us acknowledge, Sovereign, that Chorgan appears willing to discuss your offer...
 DATA / Commander, I'm afraid the only entry on Volnoth in the Acamarian database is a birth record.
 RIKER / (studying the screen) Probably one of the last of the Gatherers to be born on their planet.
 BEVERLY / I've been digging through the medical database from Acamar Three for hours and I've found another victim of the microvirus that killed Volnoth. But just one.
 BEVERLY / Fifty-three years ago. A Gatherer named Penthor-Mul.
 RIKER / Data -- got anything in your files on this Penthor-Mul?
 DATA / Yes. He was captured while leading a Gatherer raid on an Acamarian outpost. He died of a heart attack before his trial ended. (reacts) Commander, he was a member of the Lornack Clan.
 RIKER / (realizing) Display Volnoth's birth record again.
 BEVERLY / (reacts) Lornack... the same clan....
 RIKER / The only two recorded deaths from this microvirus... members of the same clan... what does that tell us, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / If these microbes were engineered for murder, I'd say somebody's going after the whole family.
 DATA / (noting new information) Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is also from the Lornack clan.
 RIKER / (to Data) I want to know just how this clan was involved in the Acamarian blood feuds... any clues to their enemies you can find... (to Beverly) How could this virus be transmitted?
 BEVERLY / More ways than I can count. And it's perfectly safe to the carrier... as long as he doesn't have the same DNA patterns.
 RIKER / Tailor made for their victims...
 DATA / Sir, eighty years ago, the Lornacks massacred a rival clan, the Tralestas. It ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years.
 RIKER / Ended it?
 DATA / According to these records, there were no survivors. The Tralesta clan was annihilated.
 BEVERLY / Something tells me they may not have all been wiped out.
 RIKER / There's got to be a missing link here...
 BEVERLY / Computer, any members of the Acamarian delegation in the Tralesta clan?
 DATA / Commander, I believe I have found a correlation between the two deaths... your "missing link" ...
 DATA (O.S.) / That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial.
 RIKER / I don't see the connection...
 DATA / Behind him to the left, sir...
 RIKER / Computer, scan left and magnify.
 DATA / The computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the face, sir.
 RIKER / (tight) Do it.
 BEVERLY / But the photograph was taken over fifty years ago.
 RIKER / Fifty-three years... and she hasn't aged a day.
 PICARD / Sovereign -- were the situation reversed, you would be demanding the same levels of representation.
 PICARD / Perhaps a short pause would be helpful.
 PICARD (O.S.) / It's quite remarkable how much alike the two of you actually are...
 PICARD (O.S.) / I'm being quite honest... both able negotiators... strong leaders.
 PICARD / Wrong, Chorgan... we've agreed to have some brandy together.
 RIKER / Don't move!
 PICARD / Chorgan, I assure you Commander Riker has a good reason for his actions... (beat) ... you do, Number One?
 RIKER / Yuta. Move away from Chorgan.
 RIKER (cont'd) / Do it.
 RIKER / Because of a man you once knew... Penthor-Mul.
 RIKER / He was murdered fifty years ago...
 RIKER / He was killed just as Volnoth was... by a deadly virus designed to attack your clan...
 RIKER / Tell him, Yuta...
 RIKER / You were with Penthor-Mul when he died...
 RIKER / I know, Yuta...
 RIKER / Stop! Chorgan -- keep perfectly still. Your life is in danger.
 RIKER (cont'd) / Yuta -- step back.
 RIKER / It is now. You're about to commit murder.
 RIKER / Murdering innocent people -- is that your task?
 RIKER / Yuta... the wars are over.
 RIKER / No, I can't. You're right. Because I've seen the part of you that regrets what you have become... Yuta, listen to me... you don't have to do this any more.
 RIKER / You do...
 RIKER / Don't --
 PICARD / New orders from Starfleet.
 PICARD / The rendezvous with the Goddard has been postponed.
 RIKER / And in the meantime?
 PICARD / Starbase three four three. We're to take on medical supplies for the Alpha Leonis system.
 RIKER / Sounds pretty routine.
 PICARD / With the Gatherer truce in effect, it should be. (a beat) We won't require a full ship's complement. I'm going to extend shore leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it.
 RIKER / I'll pass that along to the crew, Captain.
 RIKER / Parthus. A la Yuta.
 DATA (KING HENRY) / A friend.
 DATA (KING HENRY) / Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
 DATA (KING HENRY) / Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.
 DATA (KING HENRY) / No, nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to me, in his nakedness he appears but a man. Therefore, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.
 DATA (KING HENRY) / Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
 DATA (KING HENRY) / The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant.
 PICARD / Delightful... you're getting better and better, Data...
 DATA / Freeze program.
 DATA / (continuing) Thank you, sir. I plan to study the performances of Olivier, Branagh, Shapiro, Kullnark...
 PICARD / (frowns) Data, you are here to learn about the human condition... and there's no better way than embracing Shakespeare... but you must discover it through your own performance, not by imitating...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Picard...
 PICARD / Yes, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Sensors are picking up an unidentified craft in the Neutral Zone... It's heading toward Federation space...
 PICARD / On our way... Picard out. We'll get to the next act later, Data... computer, end program.
 DATA / It is interesting that a king could pass as a commoner, but why should he wish to? If he is the leader... should he not be leading... ?
 PICARD / But listen to what Shakespeare is telling you about the man, Data... a king who has a true feeling for his soldiers must share their fears on the day of battle.
 DATA / Sir, will I be able to schedule a performance for the crew in the near future?
 PICARD / Let's... not rush it, shall we... ?
 RIKER at an aft station. WORF at tactical. / SUPERNUMERARIES at Ops and Conn. Picard ENTERS the bridge. Monitors at the stations show a SCHEMATIC DISPLAY of the Neutral Zone.
 RIKER / Outpost Sierra Six confirms our readings, sir. They identify it as a Romulan scout ship... bearing two-seven-zero mark one-four.
 PICARD / A scout ship? Curious. What would bring a scout ship into the Neutral Zone?
 WORF / Shall we transmit a warning to withdraw, sir... ?
 PICARD / Open hailing frequencies.
 WORF / Aye, sir. (stops and looks up in surprise) Captain, the Romulan is hailing us.
 PICARD / Visual... ?
 WORF / Not within range yet...
 PICARD / Open channel...
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the...
 RIKER / Pursuit... ?
 WORF / Visual contact. On screen, Captain...
 PICARD / Red Alert. Open a channel to the warship.
 RIKER / (to conn) Come to intercept course. Keep us out of the Neutral Zone.
 WORF / Channel is open.
 RIKER / (to Data) When will the scout cross into Federation territory?
 DATA / Forty-one seconds...
 PICARD / Romulan warbird, you have crossed into the Neutral Zone, and are engaged in hostile action. Explain yourself and your intent.
 WORF / No reply, sir.
 PICARD / Hail the scout.
 WORF / Responding.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / We are moving to intercept... maintain your course and power...
 DATA / Scout ship is severely damaged, Captain. Engines inoperative, shields down.
 RIKER / Position?
 DATA / (works) Coordinates one-four-zero by two-zero-five.
 RIKER / (quietly to Picard) Federation space.
 PICARD / Bring us to within five kilometers of the scout. Mister La Forge, prepare to extend our shields around that ship.
 GEORDI / Captain, at that range, the shields won't be able to take much punishment.
 DATA / Five kilometers, Commander.
 RIKER / All stop.
 PICARD / Extend shields.
 GEORDI / Shields in place... we've got the scout ship, Captain...
 WORF / Weapons on the warbird are fully powered, sir.
 RIKER / Lock phasers...
 PICARD / Open a channel.
 WORF / Ready.
 PICARD / Romulan warbird, you are now in Federation territory... if you do not immediately withdraw...
 RIKER / No argument?
 WORF / Warbird has re-entered the Neutral Zone, Captain. Heading for Romulan territory. (under his breath) Cowards.
 DATA / Massive power failure on the scout ship, sir. All systems are going off-line. (beat) Including life-support.
 PICARD / (to Com) Transporter Room Two, prepare to beam the occupant of the Romulan ship aboard.
 RIKER / (indicating he should follow) Mister Worf.
 PICARD / Data, lock onto the scout ship and take it in tow... cancel Red Alert.
 RIKER / Energize.
 RIKER / (notices injured arm) We'll take you to Sickbay, after that...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43462.5. We have beamed aboard an apparent Romulan defector. He claims to be a low ranking logistics officer with extraordinary information about a new secret offensive.
 RIKER / (skeptical) And you're saying a whole base is already established there... ?
 RIKER / (impossible) The Federation sensors that monitor the Neutral Zone just... missed it... ?
 WORF / Unlikely.
 WORF / The Federation will not permit it...
 PICARD / I'm sure you're tired from your ordeal... and could use some medical attention. Mister Worf, accompany Sublieutenant Setal to sickbay. We'll arrange for your quarters.
 PICARD / No doubt.
 RIKER / He tells a hell of a story.
 PICARD / You don't believe it...
 RIKER / The empire knows we'd never allow them to maintain a base within the Neutral Zone.
 DATA / Commander, it would not be an atypical Romulan ploy. In their long history of war, the Romulans have rarely attacked first... they prefer to test their enemy's resolve.
 RIKER / And how many times in their history has there been a Romulan defector?
 DATA / (beat, checking his files) Never, sir.
 RIKER / (point made) Because loyalty is fundamental to their culture.
 GEORDI / (unconvinced) You really think he's a spy, Commander?
 RIKER / (nods) I think he's been planted to draw us into the Neutral Zone... we'd look like the aggressors...
 PICARD / ... and the Romulans would have a legitimate excuse to respond with force.
 RIKER / Exactly.
 DATA / That would also not be an atypical Romulan ploy, sir.
 PICARD / (thoughtful) It is always a chess game with them, isn't it?
 GEORDI / Well at least he's given us the chance to get a look at some Romulan technology.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Mister La Forge, you will head the away team over to the scout. (to Riker) Commander, you and Counselor Troi will conduct Setal's interrogation.
 DATA / Permission to observe the interrogation, sir...
 PICARD / No, I need you with me on the bridge, Data... there's much to be done. (beat) We have less than forty-eight hours to prevent a war... or perhaps start one. That depends on establishing the truth of...
 BEVERLY administers to Setal's neck as Riker questions / him. Worf and the security guard stand nearby.
 RIKER / Why?
 RIKER / Excuse me for being a little confused, Setal, but I thought you were defecting...
 BEVERLY / If you could just hold still for a moment...
 BEVERLY / With your metabolism, it will take a couple of days to heal...
 BEVERLY / (glancing at Worf) I've had a chance to gain some experience recently.
 WORF / (instantly suspicious) You are aware of a great deal for a logistics clerk.
 WORF / Forged credentials are a simple matter for a spy.
 WORF / You are lucky this is not a Klingon ship. We know how to deal with spies...
 RIKER / (calmly, to Setal) Your knowledge of Klingon curses is impressive. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (beat) But, as the Romulans might say, only a Veruul would use such language in public.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, please see to the security arrangements for our guest's stay...
 RIKER / You find something amusing?
 RIKER / This is the food station... you can reach me through the com panel. (at the door) Later, there are a few more questions we'd like to ask you...
 DATA (O.C.) / There is no unusual activity in the Nelvana System...
 PICARD / Isolate and magnify the Nelvana star system.
 DATA / Nothing on the sensors, sir.
 PICARD / It is hard to believe what we cannot see, Data. And yet, with their cloaking technology, a fleet of Romulan warships could conceivably be passing right before our eyes. (thoughtfully) There must be a way we can neutralize that advantage...
 PICARD / In my Ready Room. Delay time, computer... ?
 PICARD / Computer, key access four-one-two mark eight-zero. Picard. Jean- Luc. Starfleet priority code Gamma. Decode.
 PICARD / Begin message.
 PICARD / Picard to Lieutenant Worf. Please come to my Ready Room.
 RIKER / You've never actually stepped foot on Nelvana Three.
 RIKER / (referring to PADD) You were a logistics officer assigned to sector eight-one-five...
 RIKER / Eight-one-four, yes. So your conclusions about the secret base are solely based on a few files you happened to see in a computer.
 RIKER / And where are they? (off his look) All these files? Why not bring the files to prove what you're saying?
 RIKER / Yet you managed to get all the way across the Neutral Zone in a one man ship... quite an achievement...
 RIKER / Are all logistics officers taught to pilot scout ships?
 TROI / Do you expect anything out of this for yourself?
 TROI / It was only a question.
 RIKER / We're trying to get to the truth here, Sublieutenant.
 RIKER / (still not buying it) So have we all.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / Slow playback... display engine logs and power data of both vessels...
 GEORDI / Now... look what happens at zero-nine-five-four-three-three on the clock...
 GEORDI (O.S.) / The scout has sustained engine damage... forcing it to drop to point-six-one-five impulse power... for all intents and purposes he's finished, dead... the warship should overtake him... only it doesn't. Point two-six seconds later, the warbird slows to precisely the same speed...
 GEORDI / Three times... three speed fluctuations... the warship always kept its distance... I don't think they wanted to catch up.
 BEVERLY / And yet they fired at the scout ship... they could have killed him...
 DATA / Not necessarily, Doctor... the Romulans have the same capability to direct the impact of their weapons as we do.
 PICARD / Doctor, is there any possibility his wound was self-inflicted?
 BEVERLY / It was a bad burn... I hardly think...
 PICARD / A possibility...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43463.7. We are holding a position at the Neutral Zone border proximate to Nelvana Three.
 PICARD (V.O.) / There are twenty one hours left before the Romulan base becomes functional, if our guest is telling the truth. Counselor Troi, however, feels Sublieutenant Setal is being deliberately deceptive.
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / You wanted to see me, Captain?
 PICARD / Data, prepare a class one probe. Set sensors for maximum scan. I want every meter of Nelvana Three monitored.
 DATA / I will start my calibrations, sir.
 PICARD / One moment.
 PICARD / (continuing) Sit down.
 DATA / Do you require something else from me, sir?
 PICARD / Yes. Your clarity of thought, your objectivity... as always... (a beat) We're very possibly about to go to war, Data. The repercussions of what we do during the next twenty-four hours may be felt for years to come. I'd like you to keep the official record of these events, so we may give history the benefit of a dispassionate view.
 DATA / I will begin immediately, sir. Is that all?
 PICARD / How are the crew's spirits?
 DATA / They are concerned, Captain, of course. But confident. Can you not see that yourself?
 PICARD / Unlike King Henry, it's not so easy for me to disguise myself and walk among my troops. (beat) That's all, Data.
 PICARD / "Now if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it."
 TROI / (ignoring the insult) I sense there is more here you wish to tell us, yet you force yourself to hold back.
 TROI / I am not speaking of the base.
 RIKER / You're lying, Setal.
 RIKER / We're not going anywhere til we get to the truth...
 RIKER / You're a spy, aren't you?
 RIKER / Then prove it. You can start by telling me something about the location and strength of the Romulan fleet...
 RIKER / (why not?) You're a logistics officer...
 RIKER / Who's your commanding officer?
 RIKER / The position of Romulan bases along the Neutral Zone...
 RIKER / In your sector then...
 RIKER / Strength of troops under your admiral's command...
 RIKER / I agree with you... it's not worth playing this game.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, handle this at security station, deck nine...
 WORF / Aye, sir...
 DATA / Sensors are configured for planetary probe, sir... ready for launch.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 DATA / Probe on course. Sensors are functioning...
 PICARD / Coordinate your analysis with Mister La Forge... I want your report with dispatch...
 GEORDI / I don't know, Data... my gut tells me we oughta believe what this guy is trying to tell us...
 DATA / Your gut?
 GEORDI / It's just a... a feeling, you know? Instinct, emotions...
 DATA / It seems to me those qualities interfere with rational judgment.
 GEORDI / You're right. They do sometimes.
 DATA / Then why not rely strictly on fact?
 GEORDI / You can't always trust the plain and simple facts... they lie sometimes...
 DATA / They can lead to wrong conclusions, but they cannot lie.
 GEORDI / What do you think? Is he a defector or not?
 DATA / The facts to date would lead to an objective conclusion that he is not.
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) Somehow I think we're gonna catch the Romulans with their pants down on Nelvana Three... Just like he says.
 DATA / "With their pants down." A metaphor, catching them in the act... because your "gut" tells you so...
 GEORDI / But of course you can't just go with your gut either. It's a combination, Data... let me put it this way... all these feelings that get in the way of human judgment... that confuse the hell out of us... that make us second guess ourselves. We need them. We need them to help fill in the missing pieces... because we almost never have all the facts.
 DATA / So a person fills in missing pieces of the puzzle with his own personality... resulting in a conclusion based as much on instinct and emotion as on fact.
 GEORDI / Now you're getting it.
 DATA / What does one do if he has no instinct and emotion?
 GEORDI / Data... look at this... the facts just took a left turn...
 DATA / As the probe went into orbit around Nelvana Three, it began to pick up low level subspace radio emissions...
 PICARD / Could they be naturally occuring?
 DATA / The patterns are clearly artificial, Captain...
 GEORDI / The signal is so faint our ship sensors can't read it from this distance.
 PICARD / Can we decode it?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) We've tried. It's probably Romulan... but we can't be sure. (MORE)
 DATA / Cloaked Romulan ships could produce this effect.
 PICARD / What about the planet surface?
 GEORDI / Reading nothing but barren rock. They might be able to hide a base from the probe... its capabilities are limited. The only way we'll know for sure is if we go and take a look for ourselves.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) That will be all, gentlemen.
 DATA / That would be an incorrect assumption.
 DATA / I am attempting to ascertain what my guts tell me about you.
 DATA / I do not find the concept particularly appealing.
 DATA / I am told by various crewmembers that this viewport is their favorite on the ship.
 DATA / I am afraid they would require the molecular structure of the beverage in question. And, as you are no doubt aware, our knowledge of your planet is quite limited.
 DATA / Am I correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here?
 DATA / It does appear unlikely that you will ever be allowed to return to your world again.
 DATA / But perhaps we can bring Romulus to you.
 DATA / Run program.
 DATA / (continuing) After you.
 DATA / You are free to stay here as long as you wish.
 DATA / Cancel program.
 PICARD / Show him in.
 PICARD / Wait outside, Ensign. Have a seat... Admiral Jarok.
 PICARD / (casual, you do not give orders here) Have a seat, Admiral.
 PICARD / I am not convinced you are telling the truth.
 PICARD / (shrugs) You must convince me.
 PICARD / If I had irrefutable evidence... (beat) ... but you did not bring irrefutable evidence. You brought no evidence at all. In fact, this entire escape stretched your credibility beyond belief. Now we hear that you are not even who you claimed to be. (beat) A Romulan defector is virtually a contradiction in terms. But Admiral Jarok crossing the lines...
 PICARD / Yes, peace in our galaxy. (beat) Except you are not a man of peace, Admiral. Your military record, what we know of it, is clear...
 PICARD / (overlapping) ... the massacre at the Norkan Outposts, for example...
 PICARD / On what basis shall I decide, Admiral? Your good word? Are you willing to reveal ways to overpower the Romulan B-type warbirds we may encounter? Are you prepared to help us detect them through their cloaking shields?
 PICARD / You see my problem, Admiral. You ask us for faith in circumstances not only difficult to believe but compounded by your own lies, and your own reluctance to tell us all you know...
 PICARD / You have already betrayed your people. You have made your choices. You are a traitor, sir. If the bitter taste of it disagrees with you, I am truly sorry. But I will not risk the lives of my crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the Neutral Zone. You have crossed over, Admiral. I suggest you make yourself comfortable.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / (no interest in this) Yes, this is all very interesting, but...
 PICARD / (softly, the obvious) I cannot. And will not. Unless I have your unequivocal assistance.
 PICARD / Admiral Jarok has provided me with the strength, location and tactical plans for the Romulan fleet. (reactions) Mister La Forge, he is prepared to give you data regarding engines, weapons and cloaking systems on the warbird class starship. But I believe we'll find his experience as a field commander more valuable in a strategic sense than in the technical areas.
 GEORDI / (blown away) Any edge'll help, Captain.
 PICARD / Don't depend on it. For all we know, he may still be lying. (beat) We'll find out soon enough. Number One, set a course for Nelvana Three.
 DATA (V.O.) / Second officer's log, supplemental. We are prepared to enter the Neutral Zone in direct violation of the Treaty of Algeron.
 DATA (V.O.) / We must presume Romulan warships are cloaked and monitoring us. We expect swift and heavy resistance as we approach Nelvana Three.
 RIKER / Course plotted and laid in.
 DATA / All decks showing condition red.
 GEORDI / Engineering ready, sir.
 WORF / Defensive systems standing by.
 PICARD / Engage.
 RIKER / Tactical?
 WORF / Nothing on sensors.
 RIKER / I don't like it... I would have expected a greeting party...
 PICARD / Number One, you echo another noteworthy commander in a similar circumstance. One of your countrymen... (off his look) George Armstrong Custer when his Seventh Cavalry arrived at the Little Big Horn.
 RIKER / May we have better luck.
 DATA / Approaching Nelvana system.
 RIKER / Engage impulse engines.
 RIKER / Nelvana Three on screen.
 RIKER / Still no sign of them on sensors... (beat, trace of discomfort) In a way, I'd rather be fighting my way there... it's too damned easy.
 PICARD / Prepare to enter standard orbit.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / Scanning the planet. No life forms. No power sources. No weapons systems.
 RIKER / No indication of a base at all?
 DATA / No sir.
 PICARD / The subspace signal the probe detected? The ionization disturbances?
 DATA / I am picking them up, sir... but I cannot identify the source... They... seem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometer apogee.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Have Jarok brought to the bridge.
 RIKER / It's possible they abandoned the base after he defected.
 DATA / There is no scarring on the planet surface that would denote heavy construction of any kind.
 RIKER / A cloaking device, perhaps... something to hide the whole base...
 DATA / A cloaking device operating on the surface would be given away by visible distortion effects.
 PICARD / Perhaps you'd like to tell us why we're here, Admiral.
 RIKER / There doesn't seem to be a base.
 PICARD / Nelvana Three, Admiral... no base, no weapons, no sign of life at all.
 PICARD / Could they have been feeding you disinformation?
 PICARD / (continuing) You said you had been censored. Reassigned four months ago. They knew of your dissatisfaction... could this have been a test of your loyalty?
 PICARD / They let you escape with an arsenal of worthless secrets... what other explanation is there?
 RIKER / Captain, permission to withdraw from the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 RIKER / Helm a hundred eighty degrees about. Get us out of here, Geordi...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I hear you, Commander...
 WORF / Three Romulan warships uncloaking... coordinates... (no time for that) They're firing photon torpedoes...
 WORF / Shields holding...
 RIKER / Damage...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Minor damage in the secondary hull... power transfer fields may be pinched off... working on it...
 WORF / Captain... ?
 PICARD / Not yet, Mister Worf. (beat) This is just a tap on the shoulder. Or we wouldn't be here talking about it.
 WORF / They're hailing us, Captain...
 PICARD / On screen...
 PICARD / Commander Tomalak, as I suspect you already know, we have responded to a warning of a Romulan incursion on Nelvana Three...
 PICARD / There is the matter of an unidentified subspace radio emission... and ionization distubrances...
 PICARD / With a cloaked satellite...
 PICARD / Believe whatever you wish, Tomalak. We will be on our way.
 PICARD / If an apology will do, I will offer it.
 PICARD / Get to it, Tomalak.
 PICARD / Do you seriously expect me to agree to those terms?
 PICARD / I do not require one second.
 PICARD / If the cause is just and honorable, they are prepared to give their lives. Are you prepared to die today, Tomalak?
 PICARD / And so you shall have it. Now, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Aye, Captain...
 WORF / Klingon vessels are armed and ready, Captain.
 PICARD / What shall it be, Tomalak?
 PICARD / Nor will you survive ours, Commander. Shall we die together... ?
 WORF / Romulan disruptors powering down, Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, extend the appreciation of the Federation... and my personal gratitude... to the Klingons.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Take us home, Number One.
 BEVERLY / He ingested a Felodesine chip. He must have brought it with him. I'm sorry, Captain... there was no antidote.
 RIKER / A letter to his wife and daughter.
 DATA / Sir, he must have known it would be impossible for us to deliver this.
 PICARD / Today, perhaps... but if there are others as courageous as Admiral Jarok... there is hope for a day of peace when we can take his letter home.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43489.2. We have arrived at Angosia, a planet that is eager for membership in the Federation.
 PICARD and RIKER are with NAYROK, the Angosian leader, / in the rotunda of the senate building. The Angosians take their civic duty very seriously and the senate is considered a repository of wisdom and law. Various government officials and petitioners pass by, either in deep discussion or thoughtful meditation.
 PICARD / I'm greatly impressed with what I've seen so far, Prime Minister.
 RIKER / It's a tribute to your people to have recovered so rapidly from the Tarsian War.
 PICARD / An unfortunate reality.
 PICARD / I think they'll make a fine addition to the Federation, Number One...
 RIKER / I'm not sure I'd want to live here. A little stuffy for my taste.
 RIKER / Do you have means of pursuit?
 RIKER / With your permission, sir... ?
 RIKER / (keying his insignia) Mister Data, a stolen transport vessel has departed from Lunar Five. Have you picked it up on sensors?
 DATA is in command. GEORDI, WORF, and WESLEY are on / the bridge. Supernumeraries.
 DATA / (checking sensors) Yes, Commander.
 RIKER / Good. Detain the vessel and quarantine the pilot. (to Nayrok) Is he armed?
 RIKER / Did you hear that, Data?
 DATA / Yes, Commander, we will use extreme caution.
 RIKER / Keep us informed. Riker out.
 WORF / On screen, sir...
 DATA / Specifications on the vessel, Mister Worf.
 WORF / No warp drive. Minimal weaponry.
 DATA / Heading, Ensign Crusher.
 WESLEY / Three-one-nine mark two-five-zero.
 GEORDI / Vessel's speed increasing to point-two impulse. He's seen us, Data.
 GEORDI / (reacts) The ship's drive section...
 WESLEY / What happened to the rest of his ship?
 DATA / Scan the drive section for life form readings.
 WORF / None.
 DATA / Mister Crusher, bring us around to the back side of the asteroid.
 GEORDI / Sensors indicate wreckage on the asteroid's surface.
 WORF / No life signs.
 DATA / Apparently, he did not survive.
 WESLEY / Data, the drive section... where'd it go?
 WESLEY / There's no sign of it on its previous heading. Someone must be at the helm.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Status report, Mister Data?
 DATA / (simply) I am afraid the prisoner has eluded us, sir.
 DATA / We followed procedures precisely. Scanners indicated no life forms present in the drive section. I cannot explain how he escaped.
 WORF / Incoming message from the Angosian prime minister.
 PICARD / (settling into the Command Chair) On screen.
 PICARD / We appreciate the warning, Prime Minister. We will keep you posted on our progress.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, how far and how fast can that transport ship travel?
 GEORDI / Without warp drive, there's no way it could be outside our range by now.
 WESLEY / We've been sweeping the area constantly, Commander. There's nothing within sensor range.
 PICARD / A cloaking device?
 WORF / The Angosians have no cloaking technology...
 RIKER / (it dawns on him) Unless he's borrowing one... (off Picard's look) If he's hanging over the planet's pole, its magnetic field could confuse the sensors.
 DATA / I believe I can recalibrate our sensors to read through the electromagnetic interference over the poles, Commander.
 RIKER / (to Wesley) Realign for polar orbit.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 DATA / There he is, Commander. You were correct.
 RIKER / The fellow knows all the tricks, doesn't he...
 DATA / There are still no life form readings coming from the vessel.
 GEORDI / It could be the magnetic interference, Data.
 DATA / I have compensated. There are no readings.
 PICARD / We'll have our answer shortly. Lock on tractor beam, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Tractor beam locking on.
 DATA / Sir, the vessel is coming about.
 RIKER / (looking over his shoulder) Is he out of his mind?
 WORF / Sensors detect a massive power build up in his aft thrusters.
 PICARD / On Main Viewer, Mister Worf.
 GEORDI / He's making a suicide run.
 DATA / Shields have been automatically activated. Tractor beam disengaged.
 WESLEY / (reacts) He's bounced off our shields.
 RIKER / That's one trick I didn't even know about...
 PICARD / Ensign Crusher, fix coordinates of that vessel. We'll transport the whole thing to a shuttlebay if we have to.
 DATA / I do not think that will be necessary, Captain. He is no longer in the drive section. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (reactions) I anticipated this diversionary tactic based on his pattern to date. We are picking up a cylindrical object approximately seven meters in length and three meters in diameter.
 WORF / On screen, Captain.
 WESLEY / An escape pod.
 GEORDI / This guy is incredible.
 DATA / (puzzled) Yet there are still no life form readings.
 PICARD / Transporter Room Four, prepare to beam aboard anything that's large enough to be a humanoid adult from inside that pod.
 WORF / Security to Transporter Room Four.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Let's greet our guest.
 RIKER / What the hell...
 RIKER / Take him to the detention cell. Set phasers on kill.
 PICARD / We will await your signal.
 PICARD / He's in our highest security detention area... there shouldn't be any more problems...
 RIKER / None required, Prime Minister.
 RIKER / Have you run a diagnostic on the sensors, Data?
 DATA / Yes, Commander. There is nothing wrong with the ship's sensors. The reason that we did not sense any life signs aboard the escape vessel is because the prisoner has no life signs.
 RIKER / Computer, identify the occupant in the detention cell.
 PICARD / Can he be some sort of android?
 DATA / Our sensors can identify artificial lifeforms, Captain. Apparently, he is capable of deceiving the sensors.
 TROI / Are you all right?
 TROI / You are on board the USS Enterprise.
 TROI / A Federation starship.
 TROI / We were orbiting Angosia when you escaped from Lunar Five.
 TROI / I am Deanna Troi. Ship's counselor.
 TROI / That terrifies you, doesn't it?
 TROI / Do they mistreat you there?
 TROI / Why do you have such anger toward me?
 TROI / Why are you doing this?
 TROI / I am not a mind control expert. I came because I sensed you were in pain.
 TROI / (beat, reacts) The pain is gone.
 TROI / There is a duality in the man... hard to describe... he is aware of his crimes... in fact, they deeply trouble him...
 PICARD / (sensing a problem) Counselor...
 TROI / He is intelligent... a thoughtful man. Typically Angosian. I know what he's done, but when I am with him, I cannot believe he is randomly and deliberately violent... in fact, inherantly, he has a non-violent personality...
 PICARD / Counselor, it took five men to restrain him... and he took apart half of the Transporter Room in the process.
 TROI / I am not opening the door for him, Captain.
 TROI / I can only tell you I sense something very unusual about this man. Something that is not inherent to a criminal personality...
 PICARD / Your dedication to helping others in pain is admirable, Counselor. But in a few hours, I will turn him over to the Angosians... and be glad to do so.
 TROI / I understand.
 TROI / Data, do we have a link up to the Angosian central computer?
 DATA / Yes, Counselor... we are copying records for Federation inspection pursuant to their application for admittance.
 TROI / Can I see a police record on Roga Danar?
 DATA / There is no police record, Counselor.
 TROI / But that's impossible. He's been in prison.
 DATA / Lunar Five is a military prison facility...
 TROI / Military... he's a soldier... ?
 DATA / That may provide an explanation for the tactics he was able to use against us when we tried to capture him...
 TROI / (looking over his shoulder) It doesn't say what he was arrested for. Call up his military record.
 DATA (V.O.) / He served in many campaigns during the Tarsian War, received two promotions, to the rank of Subhadar... a very honorable tour of duty...
 TROI / What was this man's crime?
 TROI / I've learned you are a soldier.
 TROI / Why were you put in prison?
 TROI / There is no police record. What did you do?
 TROI / I don't understand.
 TROI / I want to help if I can.
 TROI / Why does a non-violent man commit acts of excessive violence?
 TROI / Did you have to?
 TROI / This started in the war...
 TROI / Roga Danar was an idealistic young man who answered his people's call to service. He joined the military to fight for the Angosian way of life. He didn't realize that by doing so... he would forever have to give up that way of life. He's not the same man who left home to go to war. He's been through intense psychological manipulation as well as biochemical modifications.
 BEVERLY / At Troi's request I examined him... his cellular structure has been been significantly altered... They used a combination of cryptobiolin, triclenidil, macrospentol... and a few things I don't even recognize.
 RIKER / Was he a prisoner of war? Who did this to him?
 TROI / His own government.
 TROI / He has been programmed to be the perfect soldier. He can be absolutely normal, but whenever a danger is perceived, the programming clicks in and takes over. Intelligence, memory, strength, reflexes -- all become enhanced. He is conditioned to survive at any cost.
 BEVERLY / One of the new substances in his cellular structure even shields electrical impulses.
 DATA / That would explain why our sensors did not detect him.
 PICARD / Why was this man assigned to the Lunar Five facility?
 TROI / He committed no crime. He says he was ordered there... with others like him. The first soldiers who had returned to Angosia had trouble. The rules changed too quickly. A lost temper could result in murder.
 DATA / Counselor, did no one try to adjust their progam?
 TROI / (shakes her head) They were simply exiled to Lunar Five.
 DATA / Am I disturbing you?
 DATA / Then I will leave.
 DATA / Simply a lack of pigmentation. I am an android. You and I have something in common.
 DATA / Yes. We have both been programmed.
 DATA / I do not mean to belittle your condition. I understand your dilemma. But I am curious. My program can be altered and changed. Yours cannot?
 DATA / Without further analysis of your condition by Counselor Troi or Doctor Crusher, I cannot say. But it would seem possible.
 DATA / I cannot answer that.
 PICARD / Then, perhaps you'd clarify it for me...
 PICARD / Their Gulag...
 PICARD / Was it a forced "resettlement"?
 PICARD / Even the most comfortable prison is a prison, Prime Minister.
 PICARD / Prime Minister, my medical team has suggested there may be treatment alternatives...
 DATA / No. But my program does include military strategy... that is how I was finally able to anticipate your last tactic and capture you.
 DATA / I am not programmed to kill.
 DATA / I am incapable of any feeling.
 TROI / Roga, this is Captain Picard
 PICARD / Mister Danar, I am going to transfer you back to Angosian security. They are en route and will arrive shortly. I came to tell you that I have no choice. The prime minister has insisted and we have no right to refuse.
 TROI / I do not believe that.
 DATA / Nor do I.
 PICARD / I respect my officers' judgement, Danar. I wish I could help further. If a way appears to me, I will.
 PICARD / I felt you deserved that much.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain, the Angosian transport vessel has arrived.
 PICARD / Inform them the transfer will take place shortly. Picard out. Mister Data, to the bridge please...
 DATA / Good-bye, Roga.
 TROI / Perhaps when this planet becomes a member of the Federation, we will be able...
 DATA / (to Picard) Coordinates received, sir.
 PICARD / (to Wagnor) Stand by for transport. Picard out.
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister Worf, have all security precautions been taken?
 WORF / Release of the force field and activation of the transporter will be virtually simultaneous, Captain... There will only be a point-one second interval between them.
 RIKER / Even Danar can't move that fast.
 WORF / There will be a full security contingent present. Phasers will be set on kill.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Proceed.
 WORF / Proceed.
 TROI / Roga, don't, you'll be killed...
 RIKER / (to com panel) Security personnel, full alert. Shut down all shuttlebays, transporters, and turbolifts.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain, a phaser is missing. We must assume that he's armed.
 PICARD / (to Data) Sound general quarters. Clear corridors of all non-essential personnel. I don't want him taking any hostages.
 DATA / General quarters sounded, sir.
 PICARD / Raise security containment fields immediately on decks thirty-four, thirty-five, and thirty-six.
 RIKER / Data... put the turbolifts back on line. If Danar sees they're operating, he may try to use one. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (to Picard) Soon as he does, we have him.
 DATA / Sir, unauthorized access of turbolift dive on deck thirty-four.
 RIKER / He took the bait.
 PICARD / Data -- override its destination and divert that turbolift to a position near Lieutenant Worf's current location.
 WORF / We're in position.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Four seconds to arrival.
 WORF / Phaser on overload! Seal this deck --
 WORF (cont'd) / Captain, the overload's been averted.
 WORF (cont'd) / Ingenious.
 DATA / Sir, containment field down on deck thirty-six.
 RIKER / How the hell did he manage that?
 PICARD / He's headed for Engineering.
 RIKER / (to Comm) Riker to La Forge.
 RIKER (cont'd) / Engineering -- respond.
 DATA / Sir -- someone in Engineering is attempting to override the security system lockout.
 RIKER / Riker to Worf. He's in Engineering...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged, Commander.
 PICARD / Data -- I want you to stall Danar. Allow him to think he's succeeding.
 DATA / (as he works) As he bypasses each subsystem, I can reroute it without his knowledge.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / Danar is extremely adept, sir. I am not certain which security measure he is attempting to circumvent. (then, surprised) Sir, Danar has succeeded in restoring power to Shuttlebay Two.
 DATA / I have overridden Danar's bypass; Shuttlebay Two is once again inactive.
 PICARD / Very good, Mister Data. And now we know where he's headed.
 GEORDI / He surprised us... came out of nowhere. I didn't know anyone could move that fast...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant, I am reading an open access panel... K-twelve, deck thirty.
 WORF / Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / Danar must have climbed the reactor core and gotten into a Jefferies tube. He could be anywhere.
 WORF / We believe he is attempting to reach Shuttlebay Two.
 GEORDI / (surprised) That's twenty-five decks up from here... quite a climb... but I wouldn't put it past him...
 WORF / There is a full contingent of security waiting at all shuttlebays.
 GEORDI / You want my advice... double it.
 DATA / Reading another open access panel...
 PICARD / (to Comm) Security team to Jefferies tube J-four, deck fifteen.
 RIKER / Deck fifteen. Only a few decks below the shuttlebay.
 DATA / Captain, I find it highly unlikely that Danar is attempting to reach Shuttlebay Two.
 PICARD / Explain.
 DATA / In our previous encounter, Danar employed a strategy of misdirection in an attempt to gain his objective.
 PICARD / And you believe he's using the same tactic now.
 DATA / He is aware that our sensors are unable to track him. Yet he seems to be purposely leaving a trail for us to follow.
 RIKER / And where do you think he's headed.
 DATA / I am afraid his true destination remains a mystery.
 DATA / Captain, readings now indicate an open access panel... Jeffries tube N-eleven, deck thirty-eight.
 PICARD / He doubled back on us.
 RIKER / The cargo bays?
 PICARD / (to Data) Advise personnel on deck thirty-eight to stay out of all Cargo Bays.
 DATA / (checking) They would appear to be empty, sir.
 PICARD / Good. I want you to flood them with Anastazine.
 DATA / (reading off panel) Sensors show Anestazine concentration of seventy parts per million within the cargo bays.
 RIKER / That should have put our boy to sleep.
 PICARD / Restore normal environmental conditions, Mister Data.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Move in security teams, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Acknowledged.
 WORF / Worf to bridge. We have found no sign of the intruder. But there is a pressure suit missing from Cargo Bay Three.
 PICARD / A pressure suit...
 RIKER / Could be he's planning to enter Shuttlebay Two from outside the Enterprise... bypassing the security guards.
 PICARD / Mister Worf --
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Post security guards at all emergency airlocks on decks thirty-seven through thirty-nine...
 WORF (O.S.) / Aye, sir. I'll also cover the photon torpedo launchers... Danar may attempt to leave the ship that way. Worf out.
 WORF / You are cunning, Danar... you must have Klingon blood. But the battle is over.
 WORF / (taps insignia) Worf to bridge. I have Danar...
 DATA / Explosion in Jefferies Tube section T-nine-five. All external sensors are inoperative.
 RIKER / Go to backup systems.
 DATA / Unable to transfer control...
 WORF / Worf to bridge. Danar has escaped. He used a phaser to power the cargo transporter. (checks console) Coordinates indicate he beamed aboard the Angosian transport ship.
 PICARD / Data, can you verify that?
 DATA / Negative. External sensors are still nonfunctioning.
 PICARD / Then we have no way to track him.
 RIKER / That was his plan all along.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, supplemental. We are continuing to repair damage to the ship's sensors following the escape of the Angosian prisoner Danar. He is still at large.
 RIKER / (keys insignia) Engineering, I'm getting readings at Tactical, are we back up...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / That's affirmative, Commander.
 PICARD / Sweep the area, Mister Worf...
 DATA / Captain, the prime minister is hailing us, priority one...
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Yes, Prime Minister.
 PICARD / Attacked it... ?
 PICARD / We'll send an away team, Prime Minister... Picard out.
 PICARD / Counselor Troi, Mister Data, Lieutenant Worf... you will accompany me to the planet...
 PICARD / My understanding is that these men were programmed to survive, is that correct?
 TROI / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / And they will not kill unless their survival is at stake?
 DATA / It is against their nature to do so, Captain.
 PICARD / (dry) Then let us hope they do not believe their survival is at stake.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, you are personally responsible for the captain's safety.
 WORF / I understand, Commander.
 PICARD / We're not here to fight your wars, Prime Minister...
 PICARD / You are dangerous. They are only victims. (reactions) You made them what they are. You asked them to defend your way of life... then you discarded them.
 TROI / They were not welcome here.
 DATA / Prime Minister, if you have the skills to create a master soldier, can you not contradict the effect... ?
 DATA / Have you tried?
 WORF / Did you reveal that "risk" to the men who volunteered for service?
 PICARD / They are your sons, your brothers. And you have turned your backs on them.
 TROI / There are methods of treatment... until you try them, you can't know if they will work. Even a partial recovery would give them some peace...
 TROI / (losing patience with this guy) To allow them to suffer?
 PICARD / Unless you are prepared to die, I'd suggest you put that down.
 PICARD / Danar, it appears to me that you are deliberately attempting to provoke a response... so you may justify your own attack on men who do not wish to fight...
 PICARD / Yes... (beat) But you are not programmed to murder cowards... and if they will not fight back, what will you do?
 TROI / Roga, tell them what you want.
 PICARD / You're quite right, Prime Minister. (keys insignia) Enterprise, prepare to beam the away team back.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / At your command, Captain.
 PICARD / We have everything we need for our report. Your prisoner has been returned to you. You have a decision to make... either try to force them back or welcome them home. In your own words, this is not our affair. We cannot interfere with the natural course of your society's development and I'd say it's likely to develop significantly during the next several minutes. (beat) It's been an interesting stay. When you are ready for membership in the Federation, we will be pleased to reconsider your application.
 PICARD / Four to beam up, Mister Riker.
 RIKER / Success, Captain?
 PICARD / Number One, note in your report that if the government of Angosia survives the night, we will offer Federation assistance in the efforts to reprogram their veterans.
 RIKER / And if the government doesn't survive?
 PICARD / I have a feeling they will choose to.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, set coordinates for the starbase at Lya Three.
 WESLEY / Coordinates set, Captain.
 PICARD / Engage.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43510.7. The Enterprise has put in at Rutia Four to deliver medical supplies following an outbreak of violent protests.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Although non-aligned, the planet has enjoyed a long trading relationship with the Federation.
 BEVERLY / We've still got a few minutes before our next meeting...
 BEVERLY / Excuse me --
 DATA, WORF, BEVERLY at a table... already reacting, / Beverly on her feet, moving to help... Worf concerned for her safety...
 WORF / Doctor...
 BEVERLY / Put that thing away. I'm a doctor.
 BEVERLY / Just lie still... don't try to move...
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant, I need bandages... Disinfectant... something with alcohol in it ...
 WORF / Doctor, it is not safe...
 BEVERLY / That's an order, Mister Worf...
 BEVERLY / There's a lot of bleeding, but it's not as bad as it looks. Don't be afraid.
 DATA / Doctor, a return to the Enterprise would be prudent.
 DATA / This planet does have physicians...
 BEVERLY / Who aren't here yet. I am.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 DATA / Captain, there has been an incident.
 DATA / (continuing) ... A bomb has been detonated by the Ansata terrorists.
 PICARD / Your security status?
 DATA / Vulnerable, sir.
 PICARD / Transporter Room Three, lock onto the away team, prepare to beam them back...
 DATA / Sir, I recommended such a course, but there are several wounded people and Doctor Crusher...
 PICARD / (frowns, interrupting) Yes, I understand. Picard to Doctor Crusher...
 BEVERLY / Go ahead.
 PICARD / I've been advised of your situation by Mister Data.
 BEVERLY / I already know what you're going to say.
 PICARD / (annoyed) Doctor, will you at least allow me to...
 BEVERLY / The longer we argue, the longer...
 PICARD / You are endangering yourself and the away team...
 BEVERLY / Captain, right now, I'm trying to pull a life back into a wounded body with brandy and sleight of hand. I'm not going anywhere... Data and Worf don't have to stay. Crusher out.
 PICARD / Transporter Room, do you have lock on the away team?
 RIKER / I wouldn't want to be in the Transporter Room to greet her.
 PICARD / (a beat) Picard to Data. Hold your position until the Rutian medics arrive.
 DATA / Aye, Captain.
 WORF / The tricorder is not reading any other explosive devices in this vicinity...
 BEVERLY / You don't understand... I'm a doc...
 DATA / A transporter would leave residual ionization in the air... but the tricorder readings found no trace after the incident...
 RIKER / People don't just appear and disappear... there has to be some way to track her...
 DATA / We have been unable to detect the signal from her communicator. It has either been deactivated or she is being held in a shielded location.
 PICARD / Why... her?
 WORF / Sir, I believe she was the intended target of the abduction.
 RIKER / Why would they want a Federation hostage? Their fight doesn't involve us.
 WORF / It does now.
 TROI / We have no reason to believe she's been hurt in any way...
 PICARD / In fact, it's more likely that they will take good care of her... if they want to use her as a bargaining chip.
 WESLEY / (beat) A bargaining chip?
 TROI / The innocent become the pawns in a conflict like this, Wesley.
 PICARD / The Ansata separatists have been trying for generations to be freed from the rule of the Eastern Continent. If they can get the government to even acknowledge their demands, then kidnapping your mother will have served a purpose.
 PICARD / (continuing) That may be what they are after. It may not. Frankly, I don't care. All I care about is getting her back, Wesley... In a few minutes, we're leaving to meet with the authorities...
 WESLEY / (interrupting) Request permission to be on the away team, sir.
 PICARD / No. You have an important job to do here. If we are to find your mother, we must have a way to trace the movements of these terrorists. I want you on the team that will investigate this new technology of theirs.
 WESLEY / I understand.
 PICARD / Report to Mister Data. Dismissed.
 TROI / He needs your strength right now.
 PICARD / (beat) History has shown us that strength may be useless in the face of terrorism, Counselor.
 PICARD / What exactly is Ansata policy in regard to hostages?
 PICARD / They could just as easily have shot her where she stood...
 RIKER / What can you tell us about this device?
 RIKER / You mind if we take this with us... give our people a chance to study it?
 PICARD / I appreciate your help.
 PICARD / That we cannot do for you.
 PICARD / I would like to leave Commander Riker to assist in your search for Doctor Crusher.
 RIKER / You don't sound very optimistic.
 A beat. BEVERLY / Why have you brought me here?
 BEVERLY / There are doctors on Rutia.
 BEVERLY / How did you know that?
 BEVERLY / What are you talking about?
 BEVERLY / We didn't... all we did was to bring...
 BEVERLY / People were hurt...
 BEVERLY / I have... a son.
 BEVERLY / I need instruments from my ship to diagnose something like this...
 BEVERLY / When I inform the captain how serious the situation is, I'm sure he'll agree. I've told you, Finn, the Federation is not allied with Rutians... we came on an errand of mercy...
 BEVERLY / Absolutely.
 BEVERLY / These are Federation supplies... we just delivered them to the medical dispensary this morning...
 RIKER / You're telling me all these people belong to the Ansata?
 RIKER / How did all of this ever get started?
 RIKER / You hate them as much as they hate you.
 RIKER / What changed your mind?
 RIKER / I can see where that could affect your point of view.
 BEVERLY / (to the boy) Thank you. You're very helpful... you could learn to do this when you grow up... (beat) ... if you grow up.
 BEVERLY / They're dying.
 BEVERLY / I'm seeing a complicated set of conditions... their DNA is warped somehow; it's disrupting their entire cellular chemistry...
 BEVERLY / I can make them more comfortable. That's all. The damage is too extensive.
 BEVERLY / If I could detect the condition earlier...
 BEVERLY / Perhaps. I don't know. (beat) What happened to them...
 BEVERLY / What does it do?
 BEVERLY / Dimensional shifting? You can't do that with humanoid tissue.
 BEVERLY / You're showing the same distorted readings. Not as severe as the others but --
 BEVERLY / It does if it kills you.
 DATA / A subspace field coil with an isolated power source... curious...
 WESLEY / How could something this small manage to get them anywhere?
 GEORDI / Hey, guys... look at this...
 GEORDI / The Rutian team picked up a faint nuclear vibration during the terrorist movements...
 WESLEY / (mind thinking) Nuclear vibration...
 DATA / That could possibly indicate subspace transition rebound during transport...
 WESLEY / (coming to him) Wait a minute... computer, call up files on... what was it called... (excited, to Data and Geordi) We spent an hour on it in my astral physics course last year... folded space transport...
 GEORDI / (connecting) Alternate dimensions...
 DATA / Are you referring to the Elway Theorem?
 WESLEY / Yes... computer, files on the Elway Theorem... what if they're moving inter-dimensionally?
 DATA / But the Elway Theorem proved to be entirely inaccurate... all research was abandoned by the mid- twenty-third century...
 WESLEY / Data, look at it... the faint nuclear vibration is consistent... and Elway used an isolated field coil just like this one.
 GEORDI / It would be untraceable by any standard sensing device.
 DATA / But it was proven to be fatal. To use this technology would be an irrational act.
 PICARD / We may well be dealing with irrational people, Data. Is there a way to trace this... ?
 GEORDI / (checking with his colleagues) With an adaptive subspace echogram, maybe... ?
 DATA / If anyone is willing to transport in this manner, Captain, they would suffer significant internal damage which could be detected.
 PICARD / (adding it up) And it sounds as though they might require the services of... a doctor.
 RIKER / This is no way to live.
 RIKER / For both of you.
 RIKER / There must be a better way than this to deal with it.
 RIKER / And what happened to this predecessor of yours?
 RIKER / Are you going to tell me that boy's a threat?
 BEVERLY / You should be drawing, not killing people.
 BEVERLY / How can you have such a casual attitude toward killing?
 BEVERLY / I live in an ideal culture... there is no need for your kind of violence... we've proven that.
 BEVERLY / North America.
 BEVERLY / Washington was a military general. He was not a terrorist.
 BEVERLY / You are killing innocent people... Can't you see the immorality of what you're doing... or have you killed so often, you've become blind to it?
 RIKER / No.
 RIKER / I've had enough of this.
 RIKER / (to Katik) I want you to take a message back to your people. Tell them the Federation is willing to negotiate for the release of Doctor Crusher.
 RIKER / She's a Starfleet officer. That makes her my responsibility.
 RIKER / (to Katik) Your side has demands, we're willing to listen to them. We want her back. It's as simple as that.
 RIKER / (continuing; to Alexana) I don't think it's necessary to detain this gentleman any longer.
 RIKER / Is that what you want?
 DATA / The dimensional jump creates a subspace pressure modulation, Captain. By setting up a magnetosphere faint echogram that can monitor each of their movements, we may be able to collect enough data to trace their power source.
 PICARD / Can you estimate the number of jumps it will take?
 DATA / Dimensional shifting is such an unstable procedure that I cannot say.
 DATA / Captain, I am finding it difficult to understand many aspects of Ansata conduct. Much of their behavioral norm would be defined by my program as unnecessary and unacceptable.
 PICARD / And by my... "program" as well, Data.
 DATA / But, if that is so, Captain, why are their methods often successful? (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (off Picard's reaction) I have been reviewing the history of armed rebellion and it appears that terrorism is an effective way to promote political change.
 PICARD / I have never subscribed to the theory that political power flows from the barrel of a gun, Data...
 DATA / In most instances, you would be correct. But there are numerous examples where it was successful... the independence of the Mexican State from Spain, the Irish Unification of 2024, the Kenzie Rebellion...
 PICARD / Yes, I'm aware of them...
 DATA / Then, would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptable when the options for peaceful settlement have been foreclosed?
 PICARD / Data, we cannot condone violence.
 DATA / Even in response to violence?
 PICARD / These are questions that mankind has been struggling with since creation. I am afraid your confusion, Data... is only human.
 BEVERLY / I'm sure you've misunderstood...
 BEVERLY / All they want is to get me back safely.
 BEVERLY / To find a way to reverse the effects of the dimensional shift... ? I can do that right now. Stop using it. (beat, vulnerable) Finn, I have a life, a son who needs me.
 BEVERLY / No...
 BEVERLY / We are not your enemy...
 BEVERLY / Please...
 BEVERLY / Please, don't do this, Finn. I'll do anything you ask.
 WORF / Intruder alert deck twelve...
 WESLEY / I've got a subspace reflection. It's a dimensional shift...
 PICARD / Red Alert. Sound general quarters.
 GEORDI / Security to Engineering.
 WORF / Intruders in Engineering...
 DATA / Casualties reported on deck twelve. Sickbay is responding.
 PICARD / Seal off all decks... lock on transporters to intruder signals.
 DATA / They are moving inter-dimensionally... neither the transporters nor forcefields will be able to contain them, sir.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Explosive charge on the main warp chamber...
 PICARD / Transporter room three, lock on the explosive device and energize.
 PICARD / Begin emergency evacuation... prepare for saucer separation... Mister La Forge, can you remove the charge from the engine core...
 GEORDI / Stand by... I'm trying...
 GEORDI / They've got it locked on somehow... hold on...
 GEORDI / Got it. Transporter Room, stand by to lock on my signal and transport two kilometers off the starboard nacelle.
 TROI / (reacts) His signal... ?
 GEORDI / Transporter Room, now...
 PICARD / Commander La Forge. Report.
 GEORDI / Transport complete...
 GEORDI / I have a man down.
 WESLEY / More subspace reflections...
 PICARD / Can you calibrate their destination?
 WESLEY / No, sir, the readings are --
 TROI / (during action) Transporter Room. Code one evacuation: Picard. (no acknowledgment) Transporter Room...
 TROI / Lieutenant Worf is recovering in Sickbay. The wound was not severe.
 RIKER / Dead and injured?
 TROI / Three dead, four wounded.
 GEORDI / Another millisecond, and there would have been a big dust cloud orbiting Rutia instead of the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Why. I just asked if they would talk...
 WESLEY / Sir, the next time the Ansata use the dimensional jump we should be able to get a fix on their power source.
 PICARD / Worf went down... I don't know if he's alive or dead... there were other casualties...
 BEVERLY / Was... Wes... on the bridge...
 PICARD / Yes...
 PICARD / He took cover... I didn't see any more than that... (beat) Are you all right?
 BEVERLY / (nods) They needed a doctor.
 PICARD / Side effects of their transport?
 BEVERLY / Yes...
 PICARD / We're getting closer to tracing their movements... actually, it was Wesley who put us onto this dimensional jumping of theirs...
 PICARD / He's been extraordinary throughout this. He'll make a fine officer, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / He's had good role models...
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry. (off his look) If I'd just returned to the ship...
 PICARD / (shakes his head) I could have had you beamed up.
 BEVERLY / (reacts) You wouldn't dare.
 PICARD / (reacts back) I would and I should have.
 BEVERLY / Without my permission...
 PICARD / If you won't follow orders...
 BEVERLY / If you give reasonable orders, I'll obey reasonable orders...
 PICARD / Doctor, I will be the judge of reason when it comes to my orders...
 BEVERLY / There aren't any exits to the surface.
 PICARD / Then the only way out is by transporter or the dimensional jump.
 BEVERLY / A mode of travel I'd encourage you to avoid. It's killing them.
 PICARD / They're mad.
 BEVERLY / I don't know any more. The difference between a madman and a committed man willing to die for a cause... it's begun to blur over the last couple days...
 PICARD / (concerned) Beverly, I don't have to warn you about the psychological impact of being a hostage...
 BEVERLY / I know. I understand that. But their leader, Finn, he's not what you'd expect...
 PICARD / No, he's certainly not what I'd expect. Without cause or reason, his little band of outlaws has attacked my ship...
 BEVERLY / But he did have reasons... the medical supplies, the arrests... Jean-Luc, if we really examine our role in this...
 PICARD / Beverly, you are arguing for a man who may have murdered your son.
 PICARD / You've made a grave miscalculation...
 PICARD / You've assaulted a Federation starship, killed and wounded members of her crew, kidnapped two officers... do you not expect a response?
 PICARD / You want Federation involvement?
 PICARD / You accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows...
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid I don't.
 PICARD / He has added a chair to the negotiating table.
 PICARD / You understand I will not cooperate in any way...
 WESLEY / (grim faced) Got it.
 WESLEY / We've pinpointed the Ansata base some three hundred kilometers from the city, on the southern tip of the continent.
 DATA / Sensors indicate it is located thirty meters below ground, implying a cave or cavern-like dwelling.
 RIKER / Any passages leading to the surface?
 DATA / Our readings show no evidence of any, Commander.
 RIKER / Then whatever light they have must be artificially generated.
 WORF / Request permission to join the rescue party, sir. (a beat) I owe it to the captain.
 RIKER / Permission granted.
 RIKER / Mister Data... You have the bridge.
 WESLEY / Commander Riker?
 WESLEY / (continuing; summing it up for all) Good luck.
 RIKER / We'll bring them home, Wes.
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 BEVERLY / Finn, he can help you... he is very influential...
 BEVERLY / If you could convince him that your cause is...
 BEVERLY / I've talked to him. I'll... try...
 BEVERLY / (a beat) Your places would never be reversed. He wouldn't forcibly abduct you... or play games with your life. He would treat you with respect...
 BEVERLY / You've scared the hell out of me, Finn. (he reacts) You've controlled me through fear... just like you've tried to control this whole continent.
 BEVERLY / Is that the best you can do? Is fear the only weapon you have...
 BEVERLY / You know what scares me the most, Finn? It scares me to think that you might win this fight and gain real power.
 PICARD / How dangerous would another ride through the inverter be to us?
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure. But I don't want you to start thinking...
 PICARD / It is our obligation to think of escape...
 BEVERLY / He's prepared to kill you.
 PICARD / A fine reason to escape... (beat) Do you think you've gained his confidence?
 PICARD / Indeed, you have... and a bit more... this might prove to be an advantage, Doctor...
 BEVERLY / (interrupting) Jean-Luc, there are some things... I want to say... just in case we don't get out of this...
 PICARD / Have they found us... ?
 BEVERLY / Finn...
 BEVERLY / He's dead.
 RIKER / You didn't have to kill him.
 WORF / Captain...
 BEVERLY / No more killing.
 RIKER / (not so sure) He could have killed you. He didn't. Maybe the end begins with one boy putting down a gun.
 BEVERLY / I hear I owe my rescue to you.
 WESLEY / I was just part of the team. (a real kid) It's good to have you back. (smiling at Picard) Both of you. Sir.
 PICARD / (a beat) Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher.
 PICARD / (continuing) At your convenience.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43539.1. We have moved into orbit around Bre'el Four to investigate a potentially catastrophic threat to the population from a descending asteroidal moon...
 DATA / The satellite's trajectory continues to deteriorate, Captain... This orbit will bring it to within five hundred kilometers of the planet's surface.
 DATA / No, Doctor... it is a most unusual phenomenon.
 PICARD / Won't the moon disintegrate prior to impact?
 RIKER / Couldn't we just blow it into harmless chunks?
 DATA / The total mass of the moon would remain the same, Commander. And the impact of thousands of fragments would spread destruction over an even wider area.
 PICARD / How long before impact...
 DATA / Twenty-nine hours... projected somewhere on the western continent. It would destroy an area eight hundred kilometers in radius.
 PICARD / (keying insignia) Commander La Forge, is there any way the Enterprise might be able to coax this satellite back where it belongs... ?
 GEORDI's at a console. SUPERNUMERARIES at various / positions. The matter_anti-matter blender bubbling with power.
 GEORDI / We'd need to apply a delta-vee of at least four kilometers per second. Even with warp power to the tractor beam, it would mean exceeding recommended impulse engine output by at least forty-seven percent. It'd be like an ant pushing a tricycle... a slim chance at best...
 RIKER / (to Picard) Given a choice between slim and none, I'll take slim any day...
 PICARD / Make it so.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Worf, signal all ships in this sector to rendezvous and join us in relief efforts.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to Main Viewer) We'll keep you informed of our progress. Picard out.
 RIKER / Can you give us any more, Geordi... ?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Not without burning out the tractor beam emitter... the circuits are already beyond their thermal limit.
 DATA / Delta-vee is ninety-two meters per second. The mass is too great. We are having an effect but it is negligible.
 RIKER / What is that...
 DATA / Unable to identify source...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Impulse engines passing saftey limits. We're seconds from automatic shutdown.
 PICARD / Reduce engines... tractor beam off...
 RIKER / Worf, what the hell do the sensors show... ?
 WORF / The sound is not registering, Commander...
 PICARD / Q.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are no closer to finding a solution to the deteriorating orbit of the Bre'el Four moon... but with the arrival of Q, we now have a good idea of the cause.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / We couldn't drive the tractor emitters hard enough, Captain...
 GEORDI / The beam was flexing, and it was impossible to transfer enough kinetic energy to the moon...
 PICARD / Our options?
 GEORDI / We did everything by the book and a little extra... we need more time or more power and we're short on both. I'll take a look and see if there are any rules I haven't broken.
 PICARD / Keep me advised.
 RIKER / We know you're behind this, Q...
 PICARD / What kind of twisted pleasure does it give you to bring terror into their lives... ?
 PICARD / The millions of people down there who are watching as their moon falls out of the sky...
 PICARD / And punish us as well, it seems...
 RIKER / If it served your purposes, yes.
 TROI / Turning you into a human was part of their punishment... ?
 TROI / Why?
 DATA / He is reading as fully human.
 TROI / I'm even sensing an emotional presence in him. I would normally describe it as being terrified.
 PICARD / Q, what is it you want...
 PICARD / Return the moon to its orbit.
 PICARD / Q, the liar. Q, the misanthrope.
 WORF / Die.
 PICARD / Fine. You wish to be treated as a human?
 PICARD / Mister Worf, throw him in the brig.
 WORF / Delighted, Captain.
 WORF / You will walk or I will carry you.
 WORF / (acknowledges) Too bad.
 WORF / Be quiet or disappear back where you came from.
 WORF / You have fooled us too often, Q.
 WORF / Computer, activate forcefield.
 PICARD / The question is -- what sort of jaded game is he playing this time?
 RIKER / Maybe he just wants a big laugh. He'll take Bre'el Four to the edge of disaster, then pull the moon back.
 PICARD / (thoughtful) Or he may have nothing to do with it at all.
 RIKER / Do you honestly believe Q is telling the truth?
 PICARD / Oh, I agree that is highly unlikely. But we have to proceed with our current dilemma as though Q is powerless to prevent it, don't we?
 RIKER / As he sits, and watches us struggle...
 PICARD / I don't see much choice. (speaking to com) Mister Worf, hail the Bre'el Four science station...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / They're standing by, Captain...
 PICARD / I'm sorry to report that our first attempt to restore the moon to its proper orbit has failed.
 RIKER / Our chief engineer is working on ways to reinforce our tractor beam.
 PICARD / There is hope... but if you have an evacuation plan...
 PICARD / (acknowledges) We will make another attempt shortly... Picard out.
 RIKER / I gotta tell you Geordi is not optimistic...
 PICARD / What the devil... ?
 RIKER / Data... ?
 DATA / Sensors are showing broad band emissions... including Berthold rays...
 RIKER / Lethal?
 DATA / No, Commander. Overall exposure is under seventy-five rems. Very low intensity. More like a soft medical scan... I would speculate that we are being probed...
 PICARD / By whom?
 DATA / The sensors cannot identify point of origin. It seems to be coming from all around us...
 PICARD / Enough. I want to know exactly what is going on, Q...
 PICARD / We have a moon that is inexplicably falling out of orbit... and now the ship has been probed with Berthold radiation...
 PICARD / You fell asleep...
 PICARD / One gets used to it...
 PICARD / I am unwilling to play along, Q. If you must keep up the charade, you will do it alone...
 PICARD / Q, we're dealing with millions of lives... if you have the power to...
 PICARD / Mister Data, please report to Detention Cell Three. Computer, remove the forcefield. (to Q) If this is what I must do to save those lives, I will.
 PICARD / (continuing) You will not be left alone for one moment while you are on this ship, Q. If you are human, which I seriously doubt, I suggest you work hard to earn our welcome.
 PICARD / You are hereby assigned to Q for the remainder of his stay... escort him to Mister La Forge in Engineering...
 DATA / I was considering the possibility that you are telling the truth... and really are human.
 DATA / (recognizing) An irony. (off Q's reaction) It would mean you have achieved in disgrace what I have always aspired to be.
 DATA / The human race has an enduring desire for knowledge, and for new opportunities to improve itself...
 DATA / Oh, I do not feel envy.
 DATA / I feel nothing at all. That is part of my dilemma. I have the curiosity of the human... but there are some questions I will never be able to answer... what is it like to laugh or to cry or to experience any human emotion... ?
 GEORDI / The moon will hit its perigee in ten hours... we match its trajectory... increase emitter coolant rate so we can apply continuous warp-equivalent power nine to the tractor beam. We can keep pushing it for nearly seven hours and I think that might do it... but there's a problem...
 DATA / The Enterprise will be dangerously close to the atmosphere.
 GEORDI / That's the problem.
 GEORDI / You see something here, Q?
 GEORDI / (frustrated) Yeah...
 DATA / (keying insignia) Medical assistance to Engineering...
 GEORDI / Q, I've got a few people down on Bre'el Four who are gonna be hurt if we don't...
 GEORDI / You have a better idea... ?
 GEORDI / We've done that, Q... and there's no way to determine...
 DATA / Can you recommend a way to counter the effect?
 GEORDI / (reacts) What... ?
 GEORDI / Redefine gravity. How am I supposed to do that?
 DATA / Geordi is trying to say that changing the gravitational constant of the universe is beyond our capabilities.
 DATA / Q says he has hurt his back...
 BEVERLY / (disbelieving) Uh huh.
 BEVERLY / Well, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes, ... and I still don't believe it... according to this, you have classic back trauma, muscle spasms...
 BEVERLY / You won't get any sympathy from me. You've been a pain in our backside often enough...
 GEORDI / You know, it might work...
 GEORDI / We can't change the gravitational constant of the universe but if we wrap a low level warp field around that moon, we could reduce its gravitational constant... make it lighter so we can push it.
 BEVERLY / Now what?
 BEVERLY / It hurts?
 BEVERLY / Maybe you're hungry.
 DATA / The choice of meal is determined by individual tastes.
 DATA / Although I do not require sustenance, I occasionally ingest a semi-organic nutrient suspension in a silicon-based liquid medium.
 DATA / It would be more accurate to say it is "good for me" as it lubricates my bio-functions.
 DATA / A wide variety of items... the replicator can make anything you desire.
 DATA / I have observed that many food selections are influenced by the mood of the person ordering...
 DATA / (considers) When Counselor Troi is in an unhappy mood, she often has something chocolate...
 DATA / For example, a hot fudge sundae. I cannot speak from personal experience, but I have seen it often has a profound psychological impact.
 DATA / I have never seen anyone eat ten.
 DATA / The Captain and much of the crew are not yet convinced that he is truly human.
 DATA / That would be a very noble cause, Q.
 DATA / I am an android, not a robot.
 WORF / Captain, sensors are picking up a cloud of energetic plasma... bearing three-four-one mark two-zero... range twelve kilometers and closing...
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / Energy patterns are reading as highly organized...
 RIKER / (to Picard) A lifeform?
 PICARD / Mister Worf, attempt to make contact...
 WORF / Receiving a signal, sir... on speaker...
 RIKER / Computer, analysis of signal...
 WORF / We're being hit by a field of energetic tachyons... penetrating the hull... location... deck ten... forward...
 PICARD / Red alert.
 RIKER / Increase power to shields...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Increasing power by twenty percent...
 WORF / No effect...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Increasing to forty percent...
 WORF / Still no effect...
 GEORDI / Adjusting shield harmonics... Diverting power to the forward grids.
 WORF / The added harmonics are blocking the tachyon field.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We have sustained light damage from an attack by an alien species known as the Calamarain. They apparently have a grievance with Q... no doubt one of many lifeforms that do.
 PICARD / What did you do to them to motivate such a vengeance?
 RIKER / You tormented them --
 RIKER / I say we turn him over to them.
 RIKER / I'm serious.
 PICARD / Of course. You knew this would happen, didn't you?
 PICARD / But you have so many enemies, Q, of various shapes and sizes... certainly you must have been concerned that once you became mortal... some of them might try to look you up...
 PICARD / With all your chatter about "friendship", the real reason you're here is for protection, isn't it?
 PICARD / What you call weakness, some of us would call strength.
 RIKER / Fighting off every species you've insulted would be a full time mission. And it's not the one I signed up for.
 PICARD / Indeed. Human or not, I want no part of you. We will deposit you at the first starbase. Let them deal with you...
 PICARD / As though you have the faintest notion about team-work or cooperation...
 PICARD / Then I suggest you apply to Starfleet Academy...
 RIKER / Don't use me as a reference.
 DATA / He has provided important theoretical guidance for Geordi's analysis of the Bre'el satellite, Captain.
 TROI / It seems you have an advocate, Q.
 DATA / I am only stating a fact, Counselor.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, your status?
 GEORDI / I've been putting together a program to extend the forward lobe of our warp field. The field coils are not designed to envelop such a large volume. But I'm attempting to modify their alignment parameters.
 DATA / Maintaining field integrity will be difficult, Geordi.
 GEORDI / I think we can do it manually. The moon's reaching its perigee in fourteen minutes...
 PICARD / Mister Data, escort Q to Engineering... (to Q) You will assist Mister La Forge.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, hail the Bre'el Four science station.
 DATA / I do not perceive that your skills are doubted, Q. I believe the captain is more concerned with your ability to interact successfully with... his "little trained minions".
 DATA / Human interpersonal relationships are most complex... your experiences may not have adequately prepared you.
 DATA / To function aboard a starship, or in any human activity, you will have to form relationships.
 DATA / Of more immediate importance is your ability to work within groups...
 PICARD / Your moon has begun moving toward its perigee, Doctor... we are prepared to make our attempt...
 PICARD / I'll keep you advised, Doctor. Picard out.
 WORF / Captain, sensors are reading increased energy output from the Calamarain...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to bridge. The moon has reached its minimum orbital distance... it's time, Captain...
 RIKER / We'll have to lower shields...
 PICARD / (knowing the risks) Proceed. (beat) Mister Worf, keep a close eye on Q's friends out there...
 WORF / Understood.
 GEORDI / Q, everybody already knows what they're going to do, except for you... now here's what I need...
 GEORDI / (impatient) Your experience will be most valuable to me if you can manually control the field integrity...
 GEORDI / Get to the controls or get the hell out of here...
 GEORDI / Data, you're my liason to the bridge... I'll need you with me...
 DATA / Geordi thinks he is in command here... and he is correct.
 RIKER / Engineering, holding at station keeping, range six hundred and forty meters.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Containment fields to flight tolerance.
 DATA / Warp core to ninety percent.
 GEORDI / Engage field coils. Tractor beam to stand-by. Field output... ? Field output... ?
 GEORDI / Impulse engines to full. Ready to engage tractor beam.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Lowering shields. Engage tractor beam.
 GEORDI / Extending warp field forward.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Engineering, is that the forward limit?
 DATA / Yes, Captain... we are unable to encompass the entire moon...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Do you recommend we proceed... ?
 GEORDI / I can adjust the field symmetry to compensate...
 GEORDI / You don't know what this ship can do, Mister... (keying insignia) (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / Yes, Captain... I think it still might work... increasing power to tractor beam and warp field...
 GEORDI / Shut up, Q.
 GEORDI / (do something about him) Data...
 DATA / Q, I strongly advise that you return to your post.
 DATA / (checking readings) Inertial mass of the moon has decreased to approximately two-point-five million metric tons...
 GEORDI / It's working. We can move it. Firing impulse engines...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / The moon's trajectory has moved point-three percent... point-four percent...
 WORF / Emergency... shields up...
 RIKER / Disengage tractor beam...
 WORF / Calamarain attacking...
 WORF / Shields holding... tachyon field repelled...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, the impact of the blast is pushing us into the upper atmosphere...
 DATA / Hull temperature rising... two thousand degrees... two thousand five hundred degrees.
 GEORDI / Moving to full impulse power... we've gotta get out of here...
 WORF / Calamarain are resuming attack...
 WORF / They've overpowered the shields... hull penetration... deck thirty-six... Engineering...
 RIKER / Geordi, can you direct any more power to the shields... ?
 GEORDI / We need all the power we have to get out of the atmosphere, Commander.
 GEORDI / (to a supernumerary) Try activating the structural integrity field.
 GEORDI / (yelling orders) It's not working. Structural field harmonics on manual.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Hull temperature falling, Geordi... we're in the clear...
 GEORDI / Diverting power to forward section. Now.
 GEORDI / Data... Data... ?
 GEORDI / The charge nearly knocked out his positronic net.
 RIKER / What can you do for him?
 GEORDI / We'll try to discharge and reset the motor pathways, recouple autonomic nodes...
 BEVERLY / There's overpressure in his fluidic systems, thermal shock... If he was mortal, he'd be dead.
 PICARD / (quietly seething) You exceed your own standards of selfish preoccupation. Have you no concern for the officer who very probably saved your life?
 GEORDI / Osmotic pressure still negative. Maybe if we by-passed the flow regulator...
 BEVERLY / It would be helpful if everybody just got out of here now...
 GEORDI / We'll let you know as soon as there's anything to tell you.
 RIKER / Geordi, the moon's trajectory... ?
 GEORDI / All we did was buy ourselves another orbit at most... we can try again when it comes back to the perigee...
 RIKER / And when we drop our shields, the Calamarains go after Q again...
 GEORDI / (bitter about Data) He's not worth it, Commander.
 PICARD / Come...
 PICARD / It will not serve you here.
 PICARD / That is his special nature. He has learned the lessons of humanity well...
 PICARD / I am not your father confessor. You will not receive absolution from me, Q. You have brought nothing but pain and suffering to my crew. And to this very moment, I am not entirely convinced that this is still not your latest attempt at a bad joke.
 BEVERLY / He's going to be all right.
 GEORDI / We're recalibrating his language circuits... he can't talk to us yet.
 WORF / An unscheduled shuttlecraft has just been launched.
 PICARD / On Main Viewer.
 PICARD / Opening hailing frequency.
 WORF / Frequency open.
 PICARD / Shuttle occupant. Identify yourself.
 PICARD / Q? Return to the ship at once.
 WORF / Captain, the plasma cloud is moving toward the shuttle.
 RIKER / Engineering, prepare to extend shields...
 PICARD / There is no dignity in suicide...
 PICARD / This goes against all my better judgment... (keys insignia) Transporter Room Three, lock on to Shuttle One... beam it back to it's bay.
 PICARD / Well, it's a perfectly good shuttlecraft...
 RIKER / Worf, are you sensing any sort of interference from the Calamarain?
 WORF / No, Commander, but they are continuing to move toward the shuttle.
 RIKER / Geordi, extend shields around Shuttle One...
 GEORDI / Extending shields ... (reacts) Commander... the shields are frozen...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Cause...
 GEORDI / Unknown.
 RIKER / Lock on tractor beam...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Tractor beam is not functioning either...
 RIKER / What the hell is going on?
 DATA / Sir, the aliens have disappeared. (beat) And so has the shuttle.
 RIKER / Scan the sector...
 DATA / I have, sir.
 PICARD / (reacts) Well, I guess that's the end of Q.
 RIKER / Swell.
 RIKER / I don't need your fantasy women, Q...
 PICARD / Q...
 PICARD / I don't.
 PICARD / All of it.
 PICARD / Now, at the risk of being rude...
 DATA / (reacts) If your intention is to make me human, Q...
 GEORDI / Uh, Data... Data? Why are you laughing?
 DATA / I do not know. But it was a wonderful... feeling.
 WORF / Bre'el Four hailing us, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / I'm sorry... ?
 PICARD / (reacts) I didn't. Stand by, Bre'el Four...
 RIKER / Let's see it, Worf...
 PICARD / Mister Data, your analysis...
 DATA / The moon's altitude is fifty-five thousand kilometers, projected orbit is nearly circular. There is no further danger to the planet.
 PICARD / Good. Ensign, set a course for Station Nigala-Four. (sitting) Perhaps there's a little humanity left in Q after all.
 Open on side view of painting canvas. PICARD'S hand comes into picture from o.s. with paintbrush and works on the as-yet-unseen painting. PULL BACK to reveal PICARD sitting in an art class along with TWO / SUPERNUMERARIES. They are all painting something that is presently o.s.
 DATA / (sotto voce) We have arrived at Tanuga Four, Captain. The away team has completed its survey of Doctor Apgar's work and is ready to return to the ship.
 PICARD / (putting aside paintbrush) Good.
 PICARD (cont'd) / (gestures) Please... and examine the work of the other students as well.
 DATA / Ensign Williams' striking style is heavily influenced by geometric constructivism.
 DATA / Lieutenant Wright has effectively fused the incongruities of the surrealists with the irrationality of Dadaism.
 DATA / Interesting.
 PICARD / How so?
 DATA / While suggesting the free treatment of form usually attributed to Fauvism, this quite inappropriately attempts to juxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of Picasso and Leger. In addition, the use of color suggests a haphazard melange of clashing styles. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / Furthermore, the unsettling overtones of proto-Vulcan influences...
 PICARD / (strained) Thank you... Mister Data.
 DATA / You are welcome, sir. If I may be of any further assistance --
 PICARD / No... thank you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43610.4. After completing a delivery of dicosilium to the Tanuga Four research station, our away team is receiving an update from Doctor Nel Apgar on his efforts to create Krieger Waves, a potentially valuable new power source.
 PICARD / Welcome back, Mister La Forge. Where's Commander Riker?
 GEORDI / Still on the station, sir. Doctor Apgar wanted a word with him.
 PICARD / Any problems... ?
 GEORDI / Not... with the scientific part of the mission, sir...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (a little stiffly) Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave now.
 GEORDI / I'm sure Commander Riker will explain, sir...
 PICARD / (urgently) Transporter Room! Is Commander Riker aboard?
 RIKER / You sound surprised, Mister O'Brien...
 RIKER / In time for what... ?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental: Commander Riker has informed me that Doctor Apgar was the only one aboard the space station when it exploded. We remain in orbit investigating the accident...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Why was there a power drain before transport?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I want an answer to that question... I'm sure the Tanugans will too...
 DATA / Captain, the radiation and debris are consistent with an overload of the station's reactor core.
 PICARD / Any indications of reactor core problems while you were on the station?
 GEORDI / No, sir.
 PICARD / Number One... ?
 PICARD / (to Riker) Commander La Forge suggested this was not an entirely routine mission...
 RIKER / (sighs) It's a long story, Captain... (beat) ... but I'm sure it doesn't have anything to do with this accident.
 WORF / Captain, Chief Investigator Krag of the Tanugan security force requests permission to beam aboard.
 PICARD / Granted, Lieutenant, please escort our guest to the bridge. (beat) ...slowly.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Perhaps you should tell me as much as possible prior to his arrival, Number One.
 WORF / I am Lieutenant Worf, head of ship's security. I will take you to the captain.
 PICARD / Chief Investigator, welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard... my first officer, Commander William Riker.
 RIKER / On what charge?
 RIKER / (reacts) Murder... now wait a minute...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Chief Investigator... we are more than willing to cooperate fully with you, but...
 PICARD / (to Krag) Why don't we discuss this in private...
 PICARD / You have the bridge, Number One.
 PICARD / Just what is your evidence against my officer?
 PICARD / Threats... ? I am aware of an altercation between the two of them...
 PICARD / In our system of legal jurisprudence, a man is innocent until proved guilty.
 PICARD / (interrupting) I'm aware of the Federation regulations, sir... and if you will check further, they say the captain will decide if extradition is warranted...
 PICARD / I'm saying...
 PICARD / (continuing) If I find that there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial, I will... release Commander Riker to your custody.
 PICARD / That's irrelevant here...
 PICARD / I will protect the rights of my officer...
 PICARD / You have my word as an officer of Starfleet that I will not.
 PICARD / Interrogate him here.
 PICARD / Perhaps not. (keys insignia) Mister Data, please report to my Ready Room. (to Krag) In fact, I may be able to assist you in recreating the events.
 PICARD / Commander Data, Chief Inspector Krag.
 PICARD / Data, by taking testimony from both the away team and from witnesses provided by Investigator Krag, would it be possible to program the Holodeck to recreate what happened aboard the science station?
 DATA / It would require construction and design specifications, full orthographic representations of the Krieger equipment, as well as visual representations and voice analyses of the persons involved... but yes, it is possible.
 PICARD / Data, escort the chief inspector to Transporter Room Three.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, Ensign Crusher, we are going to recreate the research station on the Holodeck. I want you to work with Mister Data on the preparations. In addition, Mister La Forge, you and Commander Riker will give the computer detailed depositions on everything you heard and saw while aboard. Counselor, you will assist me during this inquiry.
 PICARD (cont'd) / (quiet yet firm) My decision on extradition will be based upon the evidence presented in these re-creations.
 RIKER / Captain, may I have a word with you?
 PICARD / Under these circumstances, I believe it would be inappropriate, Number One.
 DATA (V.O.) / Second officer's log, Stardate 43611.6. Programming of the Holodeck has taken eighteen hours and is now complete.
 DATA (V.O.) / All participants have entered their depositions. Technical schematics, and complete records from the lab's ground computers, as well as Doctor Apgar's personal logs, have been included. The recreation has a nominal eight-point-seven percent margin of error.
 PICARD / Is there anything you'd like to say before we begin, Number One?
 RIKER / Just this. I'm not a murderer. I went to the Tanugan lab as an official representative of Starfleet. And I acted accordingly. I was there to evaluate Apgar's progress on development of a Krieger Wave converter. That's all I was interested in. Computer. Load deposition program, Riker One.
 RIKER / Run the simulation.
 RIKER / Doctor Apgar? I'm Commander William Riker; Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge.
 RIKER / (pleasant but routine) Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Apgar.
 RIKER / Doctor, if you're prepared to get started, so are we...
 RIKER / (reacts) All right... then why don't you give me the overview of your research while Mister La Forge and your assistant look at the experimental data...
 RIKER / (sympathetic) Doctor, we're not here to pressure you, we just want an update on your progress.
 RIKER / To your success, Doctor.
 RIKER / Actually, we're in this sector on another mission... and you had asked Starfleet for additional dicosilium.... it seemed like a good opportunity.
 RIKER / It's just a study of a proto-star cloud. The Enterprise will be returning tomorrow.
 RIKER / We have no wish to inconvenience you. We've arranged for quarters on the planet...
 PICARD / computer -- freeze program.
 RIKER / It's my testimony... and it's the truth.
 PICARD / Resume program.
 RIKER / I'll be very comfortable, thank you. Good night.
 RIKER / I'm sure I can find everything I need.
 RIKER / Mrs. Apgar...
 RIKER / It's late. And I'm tired.
 RIKER / Ma'am, excuse me, but I really think you ought to leave...
 RIKER / Doctor...
 RIKER / Doctor, believe me, this is all a terrible mistake...
 RIKER (O.S.) / Freeze program.
 RIKER / I didn't see Doctor Apgar again until the following morning when he asked to see me alone. Commander La Forge returned to the Enterprise... (a beat) Resume program.
 RIKER / Doctor, this will have no impact on my report. It was a misunderstanding of the worst kind... and I feel I could straighten it out if you would ask Mrs. Apgar to join us...
 RIKER / Doctor...
 RIKER / (interrupts) I don't need explanations.
 RIKER / (nods, he tried) I will tell my captain to expect your grievance.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave now.
 RIKER / Freeze program.
 RIKER (cont'd) / And then I returned to the Enterprise...
 RIKER / I fired no phaser aboard the science station.
 PICARD / That is correct.
 PICARD / Not to my knowledge.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave now.
 GEORDI / No question about it, the Tanugans are right... something was fired at the reactor core just before transport...
 DATA / The energy signature would seem to indicate a phaser-like blast...
 WESLEY / (strong) Well, it wasn't the commander's phaser. It couldn't be. There's gotta be another answer... we're just not seeing it yet...
 DATA / Was there anything else in the lab capable of creating this kind of energy discharge... ?
 GEORDI / Nothing I saw. And besides, how do you explain that it came from Commander's Riker's exact position... (beat) Dammit, I should have stayed with him...
 WORF / Sensors indicate a radiation burst on Deck Thirty-Nine. Outside Cargo Bay Twelve.
 DATA / Source?
 WORF / Unknown.
 DATA / Computer identify type of radiation.
 WORF / It is subsiding, sir.
 WESLEY / Make any sense to you?
 GEORDI / (using the VISOR) I don't recognize it. Even the main deflector doesn't put out that kind of spillage.
 WESLEY / Where would it be coming from...
 GEORDI / I don't know, Wesley... but whatever it is, it's capable of putting a hole in solid duranium.
 PICARD / (holding up a hand) Mrs. Apgar, do you understand the purpose of this hearing?
 TROI / We understand how difficult this will be for you. If you need a recess, please don't hesitate to ask.
 PICARD / Would you like to make a statement before we begin?
 RIKER (O.S.) / Doctor Apgar? I'm Commander William Riker; Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge.
 RIKER / (warm) It's a... pleasure... to meet you, Manua.
 RIKER / If you wish.
 RIKER / I'll try to make this as painless as possible. For both of us. (smiles to Manua) Do you assist your husband in his work?
 RIKER / Frankly, neither am I.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, why don't you go over the doctor's experimental data... (to Apgar) Later on, you can give me an overview...
 RIKER / Doctor, I'm not here to put pressure on you.
 RIKER / (continuing) I'm sure my report will only underscore the need for continued support of your research.
 RIKER / (glance to Manua) Success.
 RIKER / I'd appreciate it if Commander La Forge and I could stay here until the Enterprise returns.
 RIKER / It might help accelerate the process...
 RIKER / Very... charming. (smiles at her) It has your touch.
 RIKER / Who do you need sanctuary from?
 RIKER / A husband more interested in Krieger Waves than in a woman like you... how is it possible...
 RIKER / It must get very lonely for you up here... a princess in a very high tower...
 RIKER / Your sanctuary, remember... ?
 RIKER (O.S.) / She's lying... this never happened...
 PICARD (O.S.) / Freeze program...
 RIKER / Captain, you know I would never act like this.
 PICARD / Commander Riker...
 RIKER (cont'd) / This isn't me. I wasn't the one who closed the door... I didn't proposition her... I certainly didn't try to rape her... (turning to Manua) Why are you doing this?
 TROI / Come on, Will. Sit down.
 RIKER / (threatening) If you report this, you'll be making a terrible mistake, Doctor. A terrible mistake.
 PICARD / We'll, uh... take a short recess.
 RIKER / Why would she lie like that... ?
 RIKER / She was lying. You must have felt it.
 TROI / Will, I sensed no deception from her...
 RIKER / (reacts) Then you must think that I...
 TROI / No, of course not. I know you. You don't have to convince me of anything.
 RIKER / We can't both be telling the truth.
 TROI / It is the truth... as you each remember it.
 RIKER / Yes, but her version is going to put a noose around my neck.
 BEVERLY / This is healing beautifully. I think you can begin to work on strengthening these muscles again...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Security to Doctor Crusher... evacuate, repeat evacuate... radiation emissions are indicated in Sickbay...
 DATA / It is definitely the same radiation that penetrated deck thirty-nine... highly focused, very powerful... but of unknown origin.
 GEORDI / If this should happen in the engine core or the anti-matter containment tanks, we'll be in trouble, Captain...
 PICARD / Do you have any theories?
 WESLEY / Data noticed something too strange to be a coincidence...
 DATA / The two radiation events aboard the Enterprise occurred five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds apart. The science station exploded yesterday at almost exactly four times that interval.
 WESLEY / There's a point-zero-zero-one-four second variance we haven't been able to explain yet.
 RIKER / (reacts) Are you saying there's a connection between the radiation bursts and the explosion?
 DATA / We do not have the evidence to support that conclusion at this time, Commander.
 BEVERLY / If they're right, we should be able to predict the next event...
 GEORDI / We expect it in just over five hours.
 PICARD / Take every precaution you can to protect the ship's vital areas... if you haven't identified the source before the time interval is up, we will leave orbit. If you perceive any further danger, advise me immediately.
 WESLEY / We'll figure it out, Commander.
 PICARD / Deck eleven.
 RIKER / (to computer) Halt.
 PICARD / (about to warn Riker) Number One...
 RIKER / I'm not going to try to influence your decision, Captain. I know you may have to turn me over to Krag. I can accept that.
 PICARD / It hasn't come to that yet.
 RIKER / But it might... and it's more important to me that you know I didn't do it.
 PICARD / If you could just keep your trousers buckled... things like this wouldn't happen to you...
 RIKER / (not realizing he's joking) I never even gave her a second glance...
 PICARD / Number One, even I gave her a second glance.
 PICARD / Did I ever tell you about the mayor's wife in Brussels...
 RIKER / The one who collected Starfleet cadets...
 PICARD / I did tell you...
 RIKER / No, you didn't...
 RIKER / Brussels is lovely this time of the year. Isn't it?
 RIKER / All things considered right now, I'd rather be in Brussels.
 PICARD / As would I, Number One. As would I.
 PICARD / Will, giving you to them would be like handing over a part of myself.
 PICARD / (to computer) Resume.
 PICARD / (interrupting) Inspector, this is hearsay... She wasn't a witness to this incident...
 PICARD / (beat, frowns) We will... watch this evidence. And I will weigh it accordingly.
 RIKER / You're a dead man, Apgar. A dead man.
 PICARD / I don't see any alternative, do you?
 TROI / We both know Will is innocent...
 PICARD / Of course he is. But as a Starfleet captain, I don't have the luxury of yielding to my personal feelings. (beat) The evidence certainly warrants a trial... I will have to allow extradition.
 TROI / Do you think there's enough evidence to prove his innocence?
 PICARD / Frankly... no.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Captain, we have discovered the source of the radiation... can you join us on the bridge?
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (pausing, to Troi) Why don't you spend some time with Commander Riker...
 TROI / I'd like that.
 DATA / Captain, as you know, we have been looking for a phenomenon that reoccurs every five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds...
 PICARD / (nods) The interval between radiation bursts...
 DATA / We have found one such phenomenon on the planet's surface.
 GEORDI / It's the field generator that Apgar used in his research. When it's fully charged, it emits an energy pulse and then requires five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds to recharge itself.
 WESLEY / It must have been left on after the explosion of the lab.
 PICARD / But why would the generator be affecting the Enterprise this way... ?
 DATA / It should not be. It is a harmless Lambda Field generator.
 GEORDI / But we knew that somehow it was related to our radiation bursts ... and that's when the pieces started falling together...
 DATA / We now know what is causing the bursts, sir, and why the science station exploded.
 WESLEY / We also know who killed Doctor Apgar.
 PICARD / Chief Inspector, we've watched the events replayed over and over again... I've been impressed... and admittedly dismayed... by the body of evidence you've prepared against Commander Riker.
 PICARD / But isn't it remarkable that with all the witnesses, all the different points of view of the events aboard the space station... that we've never seen what really happened at all?
 PICARD / Allow me, with the help of Mister La Forge, to explain. computer, load Manua Program One, time code fourteen-four-one...
 PICARD / Play program.
 PICARD / Freeze.
 PICARD / Mrs. Apgar, this was from your deposition. It would suggest that your husband had failed to create Krieger Waves...
 PICARD / (acknowledges) He says here he needed more time... and he was upset by our early arrival. In fact, I maintain he already had made a breakthrough... and that he was lying to us...
 GEORDI / For the last several hours, the Enterprise has been experiencing unusual radiation bursts. We've identified them as Krieger Waves.
 GEORDI / From right here. In the Holodeck.
 PICARD / We recreated your science lab in every conceivable detail... from all technical sources available including Doctor Apgar's own personal records... There is a slight margin of error, but essentially whatever was in the original lab is here...
 GEORDI / (moving to the experimental display) Including the Krieger Wave converter that Doctor Apgar claimed didn't work... except it does work.
 PICARD / Your field generator on the planet surface has been sending out harmless energy charges... and this facsimile has been converting them into Krieger Waves.
 RIKER / (confused) But the Holodeck can't create anything dangerous...
 GEORDI / (acknowledges) It didn't. When you get down to basics, the converter is nothing more than a complex series of mirrors and reflective coils. The energy from the field generator on the planet simply reflects off elements in the convertor which turns it into highly focused Krieger Waves...
 PICARD / And those waves have been randomly striking different areas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generator changes.
 PICARD / (nods, yes, good question) Computer, run Manua Program One, time code, fourteen three-eight.
 PICARD / Freeze.
 PICARD / (continuing) Run Riker Program Two, time code, sixteen-one-zero.
 RIKER / To your success, doctor.
 PICARD / Freeze.
 PICARD / Nevertheless, it seems clear that your husband was motivated to earn the kind of rewards that would please you, Mrs. Apgar.
 TROI / He wouldn't have earned great profits from his dealings with Starfleet... We were only interested in a new power source...
 GEORDI / But if he could turn this into a weapon... it would be worth a lot to the Ferengi or the Romulans or a few others. Doctor Apgar had been ordering extra dicosilium for months... that's a pretty good indication he was trying to create larger reflective coils.
 PICARD / When the away team arrived early he must have been worried that Starfleet was getting suspicious. He needed more time to finish his work. Apgar said that in all three versions. No doubt, he was afraid that Commander Riker might learn the truth and cut off his support prematurely. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Discovering Commander Riker with his wife did not improve matters. (dramatic pause) And, I submit, that he decided to murder Commander Riker.
 PICARD / Is it? Computer, run Tayna Program Four, time code eighteen-one-four.
 PICARD / Freeze.
 PICARD / (nods) Tayna, what is it that he's doing here... ?
 PICARD / Why would he do that?
 PICARD / Or he might have already been thinking ahead to his next confrontation with Commander Riker... Computer, play Riker Program Four, time code twenty-four-one.
 RIKER / (shakes his head) Doctor...
 RIKER / (interrupts) I don't need explanations.
 PICARD / Freeze.
 PICARD / To Apgar, that must have seemed as though Commander Riker was confirming his worst fears. And I believe this is when Apgar decided finally to kill him.
 GEORDI / We are hypothesizing that Doctor Apgar energized the converter at the moment of Commander Riker's beam-out hoping to make his death look like a transporter accident. But something went wrong... the energy pulse hit the Transporter beam and reflected back to the lab's reactor which caused the explosion.
 GEORDI / Not really. We know that the field generator on the planet has been repeating a discharge command ever since the explosion. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / The intervals are like clockwork... except the explosion occurred point-zero-zero-one-four seconds after the first discharge... the only explanation for that variance is the time it would take the energy pulse to bounce back from the transporter beam to the reactor.
 PICARD / Nor should you, Mrs. Apgar. We have arranged a demonstration to illustrate. Mister La Forge, I believe it is almost time is it not?
 GEORDI / (acknowledges) Computer, load program, La Forge One... coordinate auto-engage time sequence.
 GEORDI / (beat) The next discharge from the field generator is scheduled to occur in a few moments. We have aligned the Holodeck program to recreate the final events as Commander Riker described them... only this time our facsimile will automatically process the energy charge from the planet and reflect it just as the original convertor did before the explosion.
 PICARD / If we're correct, we'll know it instantly.
 RIKER / I will tell my captain to expect your grievance.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave now.
 PICARD / Doctor Apgar killed himself... during his attempt to kill Commander Riker.
 PICARD / Well, Number One... have we any "further business" in the Tanuga system?
 RIKER / Not that I know of, sir. I'm more than willing to put it behind me.
 PICARD / Then perhaps you'd be so good as to get this ship underway?
 RIKER / With pleasure, sir.
 RIKER / Mister Crusher, set a course for Emila-Two.
 WESLEY / Course laid in, sir.
 RIKER / Engage.
 WORF is seated at a table near one of the windows. The / ship is traveling at WARP SPEED and the stars STREAK by. GUINAN comes over to Worf's table and delivers a drink to him.
 WORF / (looks at drink with suspicion) What is it?
 WORF / A warrior's drink.
 WORF / (measured) I would require a Klingon woman for... companionship. Human females are too fragile.
 WORF / Impossible.
 WORF / Then I will never know.
 WORF / I am merely concerned for the safety of my crewmates.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf, report to the bridge.
 WORF / (heading out) On my way, sir.
 PICARD, RIKER, TROI in Command, WESLEY at Con, DATA at / Ops. Worf ENTERS and goes to Tactical.
 PICARD / Analysis, Mister Data.
 DATA / Sensors are reading gravimetric fluctuations... most unusual ones.
 RIKER / "Unusual" how? Specify?
 DATA / Nothing I have seen before.
 PICARD / Is it a wormhole?
 DATA / Yes... and no. Like a... time displacement, but it does not have a discernible event horizon.
 WESLEY / Sir, navigational subsystems are unable to give coordinates on the object.
 DATA / (checks console) Confirmed. The phenomenon does not have a definable center or outer edge.
 RIKER / Are you saying it is... and yet it isn't there?
 DATA / I do not have sufficient information to make an analysis as yet, Commander. The dynamics of the radiation patterns---
 WORF / Something's happening, Captain. A new change in sensor readings.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 PICARD / Can you identify the ship, Lieutenant? Is it an enemy vessel?
 TASHA / (shakes head) I'm getting too much interference, Captain.
 TASHA / It's clearing, Captain. Definitely a Federation starship... accessing registry...
 RIKER (O.S.) / Looks like they had a rough ride.
 TASHA / (reading display with surprise) N, C, C, one-seven-oh-one... C. U.S.S.... Enterprise.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Military log, Combat-date 43625.2. While investigating an unusual radiation anomaly reported by Starbase one oh five, the Enterprise has encountered what could almost be called a ghost from its own past... The Enterprise-C, the immediate predecessor of this battleship.
 DATA / Sensors confirm design and specifications, Captain. Analysis of hull and engine materials conform to engineering patterns and methods of that time period.
 WESLEY / But that cruiser was destroyed with all hands about twenty years ago.
 DATA / Presumed destroyed. The Enterprise-C was last seen near the Klingon outpost on Narendra Three exactly twenty-two years, four months and three days ago.
 RIKER / And now it's here.
 PICARD / Mister Data, is it possible... that it has... traveled through time?
 DATA / It is a possibility, Captain. If that is the correct hypothesis, then the phenomenon we just enountered was a temporal rift in space.
 PICARD / A rift?
 DATA / Possibly the formation of a Kerr loop from superstring material... it would require high-energy interactions occuring in the vicinity for such a structure to form. The rift is certainly not stable, Captain. It could collapse at any time.
 TASHA / (eyes on tactical display) I'm able to scan the interior of the ship now, sir... heavy damage to warp field nacelles and hull bearing struts... internal space frame -- (shock at new reading) Life-signs, Captain!
 TASHA / Readings are sporadic... looks like they have massive casualties, but some are still alive.
 RIKER / (to com) Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency teams, stand by Transporter Rooms.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Understood.
 PICARD / Belay that order, Doctor.
 RIKER / I respectfully suggest that regardless of how they did it, they are here now and they need our help.
 PICARD / That ship has traveled into its own future. We are dealing with variables that could alter the flow of our own history.
 RIKER / But their influence on history has ended, sir. That ship disappeared from the past twenty-two years ago and never returned.
 TASHA / Captain, the Enterprise... C is sending out a distress call, sir. Audio only.
 RIKER / We have no record of a Romulan assault on the Enterprise-C...
 TASHA / Voice message has ended, Captain. All I'm receiving now is their automated distress signal.
 PICARD / Hailing frequency, Lieutenant. This is Captain Picard of... a Federation starship. Standby to receive emergency teams.
 PICARD / (to Riker) We'll handle this one step at a time. Stabilize power systems and attend to their casualties. Avoid discussions of where and when they are.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. (heads to turbolift) Lieutenant.
 WESLEY / (reading console) Message coming in from Starfleet monitor stations, Captain. Klingon battlecruisers have been reported moving toward this sector.
 PICARD / (grimly) Battle alert, Mister Crusher. Condition Yellow.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir. (works console) All decks report Condition Yellow.
 RIKER / Captain Garrett?
 RIKER / I'm Commander Riker. We have emergency teams boarding your ship. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (to Beverly) Doctor.
 BEVERLY / (quietly to Riker) The rest of the bridge crew is dead. (reading tricorder) Her leg is fractured and she has serious internal injuries. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / I'll have to get her back to the Enterprise, it's more than I can do here.
 RIKER / We'll explain later, Captain.
 RIKER / We're from a Federation starship. We've answered your distress call. Your ship is in good hands, but we need to get you to our Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / (activates com badge) Crusher to Transporter Room. Two to beam directly to Sickbay.
 GEORDI / (shaking his head at console) Pretty bad, Commander. Looks like they were in a hell of a fight.
 RIKER / If you can't stabilize life-support, we'll have to evacuate the ship.
 GEORDI / I think we can do it. I'll have to get to Engineering...
 GEORDI / (activates com badge) La Forge to damage control team alpha. Meet me on Engineering level three.
 RIKER / I'm Commander Riker.
 RIKER / Your Captain has been sent back to the Ent--... back to our ship. (glance around bridge) You would appear to be the senior officer left aboard.
 DATA / Away team reporting in, sir.
 PICARD / On screen, Mister Data.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Go ahead, Commander
 RIKER / We've stabilized life support, Captain. Mister La Forge is working on restoring the main power couplings but it'll take time. Things are a real mess over here.
 PICARD / Survivors?
 RIKER / One hundred twenty-five, sir
 WESLEY / (softly) Out of seven hundred.
 PICARD / Recommendation?
 RIKER / I'd hate to scrap her, sir. Starfleet could certainly use another ship, even if it is a little old.
 PICARD / Agreed. But we can't stay in this area too long. (makes decision) You have nine hours. If you can get her underway in that time, we'll escort her back to Starbase one oh five. If not, we'll evacuate the survivors and destroy the ship.
 RIKER / Understood, sir.
 PICARD / Keep me posted, Picard out.
 PICARD / Guinan... ?
 PICARD / You must have some idea how things have changed...
 PICARD / What things? What people?
 PICARD / What's the matter with it?
 PICARD / It's the same bridge, Guinan. It hasn't changed.
 PICARD / What else?
 PICARD / Children? On the Enterprise... ? (she nods) We're at war, Guinan.
 PICARD / (beat) Guinan, what you're suggesting...
 PICARD / (to Garrett) I'm Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Life support systems have been restored. Repairs are continuing.
 PICARD / (avoiding her question) What is the last thing you remember?
 PICARD / Distress signal... ?
 BEVERLY / Please... try to keep still...
 PICARD / You are aboard the Enterprise, Captain... one-seven-oh-one-D.
 PICARD / You have come twenty-two years into the future.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / (reluctantly) If you wish, I will see to it that they're informed...
 PICARD / I am concerned that if you return to your own time with knowledge of the future...
 PICARD / Have you any idea how this happened?
 PICARD / It is possible your exchange of fire was the catalyst for the formation of a temporal rift. (beat) History never recorded your battle with the Romulans.
 PICARD / The Narendra Three outpost was wiped out.
 PICARD / It is regrettable you did not succeed, Captain. If a Federation starship had rescued a Klingon outpost... it might have averted twenty years of war.
 RIKER / I'm not getting any kind of ready condition on the impulse engines, La Forge...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged, Commander... some of the engine control processors went off-line. And there's probably damage to the accelerator coils... stand by...
 TASHA / I'm reading forty percent on forward shields... what do you have on aft...
 TASHA / That's not going to do... Commander, advise Lieutenant La Forge that shields are below minimum...
 RIKER / Acknowledged...
 TASHA / How do you know your family's not still alive?
 TASHA / What are the status readouts on main phaser banks?
 TASHA / (acknowledges) Let's take a look at the torpedo launchers...
 TASHA / You may not like the future. It's been a long war. The Federation's lost more than half of Starfleet to the Klingons.
 TASHA / A lot of changes, Lieutenant. A lot of changes.
 TASHA / Photon banks are depleted... auxiliary fusion generators are down...
 DATA / The probability is high that the temporal rift is symmetrical, Captain.
 PICARD / If that is the case, what would happen if the Enterprise-C were to fly back through it?
 DATA / (reacts) Back, sir? The Enterprise-C would emerge in her own time period at almost the same instant she left.
 PICARD / Right in the middle of her battle with the Romulans.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Based on the logs of the Enterprise-C, is there any possibility she could survive that battle?
 DATA / None, sir.
 PICARD / Then sending them back would be condemning them to death.
 TASHA / Lieutenant... ?
 TASHA / (re: the new Enterprise) She was the first Galaxy Class warship built by the Federation... forty-two decks... capable of transporting over six thousand troops...
 TASHA / Four years. Straight out of the Academy. I was lucky to get the Enterprise.
 TASHA / And soon. Our sensors have picked up Klingon warships in this sector, Captain.
 TASHA / That's me, Captain.
 BEVERLY / Where do you think you're going?
 BEVERLY / Captain, you need at least another twenty-four hours...
 BEVERLY / (equally stubborn) And captains always push themselves too hard.
 PICARD / I need more.
 PICARD / Then I can't send them back.
 PICARD / Dammit, Guinan, they will die moments after they return... how can I ask them to sacrifice their lives based solely on your... intuition?
 PICARD / Who is to say this history is any less proper than the other?
 PICARD / Not good enough. (softly agonizing) Not good enough. I will not ask them to die.
 PICARD / I cannot justify readjusting history on the basis of saving lives in war... shall I return to Sarajevo and stop the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand... or go back to warn Station-Salem Four of the Bel-zon raid...
 PICARD / And what is the guarantee that by going back they will succeed... ?
 PICARD / In fact, they could conceivably create a third time line.
 PICARD / Every instinct tells me it's wrong and dangerous and futile.
 TASHA / Deflector shield technology has advanced considerably during the war... our heat-dissipation rates are probably double those of the Enterprise-C, so we can hang in a firefight longer...
 TASHA / Guinan... ?
 TASHA / Not yet... Is something wrong, Guinan?
 TASHA / Just a couple of T-K-L meal rations... we're in a hurry. (barely hesitates) Oh, this is, Lieutenant Castillo...
 TASHA / (curious) First time for everything.
 TASHA / (confused chuckle) It's just that I've never seen anything bother her before...
 TASHA / Standard rations. Food replicators are on minimum power... (MORE)
 TASHA (Cont'd) / Everything else is diverted to defensive systems. (beat) So where was I...
 TASHA / You're gonna need it, Lieutenant...
 TASHA / Yeah.
 TASHA / (smiles) Okay, Castillo.
 TASHA / Richard.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / This is the captain. Senior officers will report to my Ready Room immediately.
 TASHA / So much for lunch.
 BEVERLY / Captain, are you suggesting they should return and attempt to complete their mission?
 PICARD / I am, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Based on Guinan's intuition... ?
 RIKER / But it won't accomplish anything. There's no way they can save Narendra Three...
 TASHA / Captain Garrett says there were four Romulan warbirds. The Enterprise-C would be outmanned and outgunned...
 GEORDI / Unless we were to re-arm them with modern...
 PICARD / We can't do that. If we send this ship back with new technology... we would be altering the past...
 RIKER / But that's what you're talking about doing anyway, isn't it? Altering the past.
 PICARD / We're talking about restoring the past.
 GEORDI / How could Guinan know that history has been altered... if she's been altered along with the rest of us?
 DATA / Perhaps her species has a perception that goes beyond linear time.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) There are many things about her species that cannot be easily explained. Even she cannot explain how or why she senses that history has been altered. And yet it is very possible she is correct. A ship from the past has traveled through time. Who among us could know what effect that event has had on the present. Indeed, we will never know for certain if Guinan is correct. But I, for one, have decided the consequences of that possibility are too grave to ignore.
 RIKER / Sir, if you wish my opinion...
 PICARD / I think I know your opinion, Commander. This is a briefing. I'm not seeking your consent.
 RIKER / With all due respect, Captain, we'd be asking one hundred and twenty-five people to die a meaningless death.
 DATA / Not necessarily meaningless, Commander. Klingons place honor above all else. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / If the crew of the Enterprise-C had died fighting for the survival of a Klingon outpost, that would have been considered a meaningful act of honor by the Klingon Empire.
 PICARD / Even their deaths... might have prevented the war.
 PICARD / If the Enterprise-C returns to the battle and its mission is a success, history will be irrevocably changed. This time line will cease to exist... and a new future will have been created. (beat) I've weighed the alternatives. I will follow Guinan's recommendations. (beat) Dismissed.
 BEVERLY / If she's right... we may not even be in the alternate time line...
 GEORDI / Yeah, who knows if we're dead or alive...
 DATA / Engineering.
 DATA / Is Engineering your destination as well?
 TASHA / Oh... Deck six... sorry...
 DATA / If I interpret your facial expression correctly, you were preoccupied with something unpleasant.
 TASHA / I was just thinking... a lot of things... (short sigh) I've been working with one of the officers from the Enterprise-C... he's nice, you know? I like him. I'm worried about what's going to happen to him.
 DATA / We may never know what happens, Tasha. If they succeed, we will not even realize any of these events occurred.
 TASHA / Data, how different do you think your life would be in the other time line?
 DATA / (considers a beat) The possibilities are too numerous even for me to calculate, Tasha.
 TASHA / (thinking to herself) Kind of scary, isn't it?
 DATA / Scary? I would not know.
 PICARD / (nods) I discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom... I've learned to trust it. (beat) If you wish, I can arrange for you to speak with her...
 PICARD / I can't do that.
 PICARD / By going back, you may be a great deal more helpful. The war is going badly for the Federation. Much worse than is generally known.
 PICARD / Starfleet Command believes defeat is inevitable... that within six months we will have no choice but to surrender...
 PICARD / One more ship will make no difference in the here and now, Captain. But twenty-two years ago, one ship could have stopped this war before it ever started.
 PICARD / I know you will, Captain.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Yar...
 TASHA / Permission to remain for a moment, sir...
 PICARD / Granted.
 TASHA / I just wanted to say good luck...
 TASHA / Your ship has a lot more maneuverability than the Romulan counterparts of that era... in fact, if you could isolate...
 TASHA / You'll do fine.
 TASHA / Good-bye, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / Shields are up. Functioning.
 RIKER / (to comm) Acknowledged, Enterprise-C. Captain Picard is safely aboard... (to Data) Fire phasers.
 DATA / (overlapping) Firing phasers...
 PICARD / Situation report...
 RIKER / One Klingon bird of prey... off the starboard bow...
 TASHA / Firing phasers...
 DATA / The Klingon vessel has re-cloaked, sir. I have no readings.
 PICARD / Captain Garrett -- damage report. (no answer) Captain Garrett...
 TASHA (com) / This is Lieutenant Yar, sir.
 TASHA / Captain Garrett is dead.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the last senior officer alive... he will have limited support from Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff in Engineering...
 RIKER / (to Castillo) But certainly, history never meant this ship to be led into battle without your captain.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Commander Data to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Sir, sensors are showing additional instability in the time rift. Possibly the result of the battle with the Klingons.
 PICARD / Any signs of other Klingon vessels?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / No, sir.
 TASHA / I'm sure our coordinates have been transmitted to the Klingon command... we must not remain here.
 PICARD / How soon will your ship be ready?
 PICARD / (to Riker) We will maintain position to provide cover. (to Castillo) Make it so.
 TASHA / I wish there was more time.
 TASHA / Guinan, I have to know something.
 TASHA / What happens to me in the other time line?
 TASHA / But there's something more when you look at me, isn't there...
 TASHA / I've seen it in your eyes, Guinan. We've known each other too long...
 TASHA / Where am I supposed to be?
 TASHA / Do you know how?
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Yes, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / Captain, I request a transfer to the Enterprise-C.
 PICARD / For what reason?
 TASHA / They need someone at Tactical.
 PICARD / You're needed here.
 TASHA / Sir, I don't belong here.
 PICARD / (reacts) Sit down. (she does) What did she tell you?
 TASHA / I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be alive.
 PICARD / (rather aghast) She felt it was necessary to disclose this to you?
 TASHA / I felt it was necessary.
 PICARD / I see. (beat) You realize that it is very possible that the Enterprise-C could fail. We may be forced to remain in this time line... in which case your life would go on, hopefully for a long while.
 TASHA / I know how important it is that they don't fail, Captain. That's why I'm requesting this transfer.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, you don't belong on that ship...
 TASHA / No. Captain Garrett belongs on that ship. But now that she's dead, there's a certain logic in this request.
 PICARD / There's no logic in it at all. (beat) Tasha, whether they succeed or not, the Enterprise-C will be destroyed...
 TASHA / At least, with a tactical officer on board, they will have a chance to defend themselves well, Captain... it may be a matter of seconds or minutes... but those could be the minutes that change history... (beat) Guinan says I died a senseless death in the other time line. I didn't like the sound of that, sir. I've always known the risks that come with a Starfleet uniform. If I am to die in one, I'd like my death to count for something.
 PICARD / Lieutenant...
 PICARD / Permission granted.
 TASHA / Thank you, sir.
 TASHA (O.S.) / I'll handle Tactical.
 TASHA / Lieutenant Tasha Yar reporting for duty, sir.
 TASHA / I am now. Captain Picard approved my request for transfer.
 TASHA / I know the mission. These are my orders, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / You need me. Show me someone on your crew that can do the job better than I can.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 TASHA / We've finished the transfer of equipment, Captain. The new converters should be able to compensate for the damaged units on the Enterprise-C.
 WESLEY / Long-range scans have picked up Klingon battlecruisers, Captain. They are on an intercept course.
 RIKER / E.t.a.?
 WESLEY / Fourteen minutes, thirty-one seconds.
 PICARD / Red Alert. All hands to battle stations.
 TASHA / I'm on my way, sir. (beat) Good-bye, Captain.
 PICARD / Good-bye, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / Damage control teams have all returned to the Enterprise-D... Captain.
 TASHA / Shields up. Charging weapon systems.
 RIKER / Number and type of ships, Mister Crusher?
 WESLEY / Three K'vort class battlecruisers.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Not bothering to cloak themselves.
 PICARD / They shouldn't be so confident... after the pasting we gave them at Archer Four.
 RIKER / (quietly) We won't last long against that many.
 PICARD / We could, of course, outrun the Klingons, but we must protect the Enterprise-C until she can enter the temporal rift. (beat) We may not survive... but we must succeed... Let's make sure they don't forget the name Enterprise.
 DATA / Shields holding.
 PICARD / (coolly) Hold your fire. Mister Crusher, come about to one-four-eight mark zero-zero-three, on my command.
 RIKER / Ready photon torpedoes. Dispersal pattern: Sierra.
 PICARD / Ready... and... now!
 DATA / One enemy target hit, sir. Moderate damage to their forward shields.
 DATA / Our shields still holding. Minor damage to secondary hull.
 RIKER / Course one-seven-zero, mark zero-one-four.
 WESLEY / One ship has broken off and is heading toward the Enterprise-C.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher. Belay previous course change... keep us within two hundred kilometers of the Enterprise-C.
 RIKER / Damage control teams to deck fourteen.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Engineering to bridge. Starboard power coupling is down. Containment field generator three is damaged -- attempting to bypass.
 RIKER / If we lose anti-matter containment...
 PICARD / Acknowledged, Engineer.
 WESLEY / The Klingons are flanking us... trying to draw us away from the Enterprise-C.
 PICARD / Hold your course. (to Tactical) Continual fire, all phasers.
 DATA / One enemy target destroyed.
 PICARD / Damage report!
 RIKER / Heavy casualties in the secondary hull. Navigational sensor array inoperative.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Anti-matter containment fields failing... if I can't stabilize them, we'll have to eject the reactor core or she'll blow...
 DATA / (sees new reading on console) Shields buckling, Captain. They will not --
 GEORDI / Engineer to bridge. Can't hold the antimatter containment fields... Initiating emergency shutdown...
 GEORDI / Coolant leak! bridge, we have a coolant leak in the engine core! I can't shut it down -- estimate two minutes to warp core breach...
 PICARD / How long until the Enterprise-C enters the rift?
 DATA / Fifty-two seconds.
 PICARD / All remaining power to defense systems.
 DATA / Power couplings severed in forward phaser banks. Attempting to by-pass. (works console) Controls not responding.
 PICARD / (softly) Like hell.
 PICARD / Report, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Readings fluctuated momentarily, Captain. It appeared to be a ship, but then it vanished.
 DATA / The rift is closing in on itself, Captain.
 PICARD / Very well. Prepare a class-one sensor probe. We'll leave it behind to monitor the final closure. Mister Crusher, lay in a course for Archer Four.
 PICARD / Guinan?... Yes... everything's fine. Is something wrong?
 GEORDI / Thanks, Guinan.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43657.0 We have arrived at sector four-eight-seven to begin charting this region of the galaxy. Commander Riker has been spared this sometimes tedious duty by virtue of a long overdue personal leave.
 GEORDI and WESLEY walking swiftly down the corridor. / At a connecting juncture TROI joins them. They are surprised when they realize they are all headed in the same direction.
 GEORDI / Did he send for you too?
 TROI / Yes... he was very mysterious about it.
 WESLEY / Does anyone have any idea what this is all about?
 GEORDI / Something happened at that cybernetics conference. Since he's come back he's spent every off duty minute in that lab.
 TROI / It is very unlike Data to be secretive.
 WESLEY / And cautious. He kept the lab locked.
 GEORDI / Now how would you know that?
 DATA / Oh, you are early. Just a moment please.
 DATA / You may enter now.
 GEORDI / C'mon, Data, what is this...
 WESLEY / Yeah, what's going on?
 DATA / I have invited you here to meet someone.
 DATA / This is Lal. Lal, say hello to Counselor Deanna Troi...
 TROI / How do you do, Lal.
 DATA / And this is Geordi La Forge and Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / (sotto, to Geordi) Father?
 DATA / It is the custom that we wear clothing.
 WESLEY / It called you "Father", Data.
 DATA / Yes, Wesley. Lal is my child.
 DATA / It has a positronic brain... one very similar to my own... I began to program it at the cybernetics conference...
 GEORDI / But nobody's ever been able to do that... at least not since you were programmed Data...
 DATA / There was a new submicron matrix-transfer technology introduced at the conference which I discovered could be used to lay down complex neural net pathways...
 WESLEY / (understanding) You mean a transfer... from your your brain to Lal's...
 DATA / Exactly, Wesley. I realized for the very first time it was possible to continue Doctor Soong's work. My initial transfers have produced very encouraging results... so I brought Lal's brain back with me to continue.
 PICARD / (unhappy) Data...
 PICARD / I would like to have been consulted.
 DATA / I have not observed anyone else on board consult with you about their procreation, Captain.
 PICARD / No, but...
 PICARD / ... in your case... it's not quite the same.
 DATA / The intention is the same.
 DATA / Lal's creation is entirely dependent on me. I am giving it knowledge and skills that are stored in my brain... its programming reflects mine in the same way a human child's genes reflect its parent's genes...
 GEORDI / It's true, Captain, this technology requires another positronic brain that's fully programmed...
 WESLEY / And Data's the only person around who has one. That does kind of makes him Lal's dad.
 DATA / Of course, it is not complete. We have only made two transfers.
 TROI / Why didn't you give it a more human look, Data?
 DATA / I decided to allow Lal to choose its own appearance and sex.
 PICARD / Mister Data, at your convenience, I'd like to talk to you in my Ready Room. Counselor... (please join me)
 DATA / Captain... Have a cigar.
 DATA / I believe it is customary.
 PICARD / I would suggest we do whatever we can to discourage this perception of the new android as a "child"...
 PICARD / Counselor, it is not a child. It is an invention, albeit an extraordinary one.
 TROI / Why should biology or technology determine whether it is a child? I see a man who has created an offspring... a new life out of his own being. That suggests a child to me. If Data wishes to call Lal his child, who are we to argue?
 PICARD / (frowns) If he must, fine. But I don't understand how he can call a five foot android, with heuristic learning systems and the strength of a ten men a "child".
 TROI / You've never been a parent.
 PICARD / Data, what you have done has very serious ramifications and I am dismayed that you did not inform anyone of what you were doing.
 DATA / I am sorry I did not anticipate your objections, Captain. Do you wish me to deactivate Lal?
 PICARD / It is a life, Data. It cannot be activated or de-activated simply. It is a stupendous undertaking. Have you any idea what will happen when Starfleet learns of this?
 DATA / I have followed all Starfleet regulations to the best of my ability, Captain... I expected they would be pleased...
 PICARD / We'll see. (beat) My foremost concern is for the safety of this ship and crew. You are faster, stronger, and far more knowledgeable than any human...
 DATA / I can assure you Lal's programming includes psychological inhibitor safeguards to prevent any threat to the Enterprise.
 PICARD / And in the event of a malfunction?
 DATA / A malfunction is of course a possibility, Captain. But Lal's program is equipped like mine -- it will shut down before deleterious behavior can begin.
 PICARD / You've taken on quite a responsibility, Mister Data...
 DATA / (acknowledges) To prepare, I have scanned all the available literature on parenting. There seems to be much confusion on the issue. One traditional doctrine insists "spare the rod and spoil the child", suggesting a punitive approach... another more liberal attitude would allow a child enormous freedom...
 PICARD / (trying to interrupt) Data...
 DATA / And what the Klingons do to their children...
 PICARD / (interrupting) I'm not talking about parenting. (beat) I'm talking about the extraordinary consequences of creating new life.
 DATA / (confused) Does that not describe becoming a parent, sir?
 PICARD / You are seeking to achieve what no one, other than your own creator, has been able to achieve -- to make another sentient, functional android. To make another Data.
 DATA / That is why I must attempt this, Captain. I have observed that in most species, there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves. And while I have not been programmed with instinctive behavior patterns, I do understand that I have been, until now, the last of my kind. If I were damaged or destroyed, I would be lost forever. But if I am successful with the creation of Lal, my continuance is assured. I believe I understand the consequences. And I am prepared to accept the responsibility.
 TROI / That's right, Lal. Just like me.
 DATA / Correct.
 DATA / That is why you must choose a gender, Lal. And complete your appearance.
 DATA / Access your data bank on sexuality, level two. That will define the parameters.
 TROI / Whatever you choose will be yours for your lifetime, Lal... It is a decision that will affect how people interrelate with you.
 DATA / No, Lal... that would be confusing. We are taking you to the Holodeck to show you several thousand composites which I have programmed. You may choose from them.
 TROI / Several thousand... ?
 DATA / This is a big decision...
 DATA / Counselor... (her eyes open) Lal has narrowed the choices to four... would you like to see?
 TROI / Yes... yes, of course, Data...
 DATA / Computer, Lal -- gender sequence finalists... begin...
 DATA / An Andorian female...
 TROI / Interesting. You'd be the only one on board the Enterprise, Lal...
 DATA / That could make socialization more difficult.
 DATA / A human male...
 TROI / Very attractive... no problem with socialization here...
 DATA / The human female.
 TROI / I like her.
 DATA / A Klingon male.
 TROI / A friend for Worf.
 TROI / They are all very interesting, Lal. Do you have a favorite?
 DATA / Come in, Counselor. I have completed the assembly of the replicated anatomy. I was able to provide Lal with even more realistic skin and eye color than my own.
 TROI / (softly) Congratulations, Data, it's a girl.
 DATA / This is home.
 DATA / Correct, Lal. We are a family.
 DATA / A chair... to sit in.
 DATA / A painting.
 DATA / I will teach you how to recognize the artistry of paintings.
 DATA / Yes, very good, Lal. You have correctly processed the sense of touch.
 DATA (cont'd) / There are many fascinating experiences I wish to share with you.
 DATA / No, Lal, this is a flower.
 DATA / Inhale.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA (V.O.) / Second officer, science log supplemental, copy: Starfleet research, Daystrom Institute, Galor Four annex. Reference: development, android designate Lal.
 DATA (V.O.) / Training in social skills at the most elementary level has begun. Lal is progressing very slowly but is not deterred by early setbacks.
 DATA (V.O.) / Motor coordination has improved by twelve-point-four percent... this reflects the adaptation of second level neural transfers...
 DATA (V.O.) / Reflexes still need to develop. The integration of hand_eye coordination seems to be proceeding at a slower developmental rate.
 DATA (V.O.) / Visual comprehension is especially difficult for Lal. Translating her vast data banks into recognizable applications may improve with additional transfers.
 DATA (V.O.) / She is also learning to supplement innate android behavior with human responses.
 DATA (V.O.) / Most encouraging is her commitment to master the skills necessary to live successfully among humans. Her curiosity is insatiable... although it sometimes creates inappropriate behavior...
 DATA (V.O.) / And I have been interested to note that as I observe Lal learning about her world... I share in her experience, almost as though I am learning things over again...
 DATA / (to Wesley) The transfer itself is fairly simple. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / Each neural pathway in my brain has been duplicated precisely in hers...
 WESLEY / One advantage of a brain like yours, Data is that we can replicate it.
 DATA / (acknowledges) Theoretically, the duplicate brains should be able to store and process the same information... but until all the transfers are complete, we will not know for certain.
 WESLEY / What does Lal do while you're on duty?
 DATA / She studies in our quarters. She does not require much supervision, Wesley. Lal is quite self-sufficient.
 WESLEY / You could send her to school.
 DATA / Lal already has access to the sum of human knowledge.
 WESLEY / There are a lot of things you can learn just by being with kids your own age, Data.
 DATA / She is only two weeks old.
 WESLEY / Well, closer to her own age.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Doctor Crusher to Ensign Crusher. Aren't you supposed to be getting a hair cut, Wesley?
 WESLEY / Yes, Mom. I'm on my way. (frowns) Parents. (beat) Nothing personal.
 DATA / Lal, the third crosslink transfer series is complete.
 DATA / Purpose?
 DATA / It is a complex question, Lal. I can only begin to answer it by telling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to the world in which we live.
 DATA / Because you are my child.
 DATA / Your questions suggest we have made a successful transfer of the heuristic associative pathways. You will now begin to process information on logic, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. You are truly becoming sentient, Lal.
 DATA / By developing the awareness to examine and question your perceptions.
 DATA / (interrupting) Lal, did you know that tomorrow will be your first day of school?
 PICARD / I assure you, Admiral, there's no better guide into this life for Lal than Data... He's doing an excellent job with her...
 PICARD / This starship's mission is to seek out new life and that is what Commander Data is doing. Under my direction.
 PICARD / As do I. (beat, conciliatory) I would be willing to consider releasing Lal and Data to join you... so he may continue his work with her.
 PICARD / (dry) Aren't we all, Admiral...
 PICARD / Admiral, to you Lal is a new android. But to Data, she is his child.
 PICARD / Yes, Admiral. It may not be easy for you and I to see her that way. But he does. And I respect that. They will remain here for now.
 DATA / A perfect score.
 DATA / I see.
 DATA / That would seem to be reasonable.
 DATA / It is a human physiological response to humor.
 DATA / Deck fifteen.
 DATA / Lal...
 DATA / The children were not laughing with you... they were laughing at you.
 DATA / One is meant kindly... the other is not.
 DATA / Because you are different. And sometimes differences scare people. I have learned that some of them use humor to hide their fears.
 BEVERLY is at her desk, working. Data ENTERS. / 
 DATA / Doctor, I require your advice as a successful parent.
 BEVERLY / (reacts) Well, thank you, Data. I'd like to think I am. Sit down. How's Lal?
 DATA / Lal is realizing that she is not the same as the other children.
 BEVERLY / Is it lonely for her?
 DATA / She does not feel the emotion of loneliness, but she can observe how isolated she is from the others. She wants to be more like them.
 BEVERLY / Sounds familiar.
 DATA / Yes, Doctor. It is an experience I know too well. But I do not know how to help her. Lal is passing into sentience. It is perhaps the most difficult stage of development for her.
 BEVERLY / It's also a very human development, Data. As our minds and bodies grow, sometimes quite rapidly, we get confused too... we look around and try to see how we fit in... (a beat) When Wesley was growing up, he was an extraordinarily bright boy... but he had a hard time making friends. The other children were a little intimidated by him.
 DATA / (interested) That is precisely what happened to Lal at school. How did you help him?
 BEVERLY / Well, first I had to go back into my own childhood and remember how painful it was for me. Because there was a time when I didn't feel very popular either. When I told that to Wesley, it made him feel a little better. He knew I understood what he was going through.
 DATA / (beat) I have not told Lal how difficult it was for me to assimilate. I did not want it to discourage her. Perhaps this was an error of judgement.
 BEVERLY / You had no one with experience to help you through sentience. At least, she has you. Just help her realize that she's not alone. Be there to nurture her when she needs love and attention.
 DATA / I can give her attention, doctor. But I am incapable of giving her love.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) Why do I find that so hard to believe?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain, incoming signal. Starfleet priority one. Admiral Haftel.
 PICARD / On my monitor, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / Admiral.
 PICARD / Not at all.
 PICARD / Understood.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental: We are holding position pending the arrival of Admiral Haftel from Starfleet Research.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Commander Data is completing his final neural transfers to the android he has named Lal... Which I have learned, in the language of Hindi, means "beloved".
 DATA / Guinan, Lal needs to observe human behavior.
 DATA / In return for this opportunity, Lal is willing to provide services to assist you.
 DATA / I believe what I said was that Guinan had much life experience, Lal...
 DATA / That would be very beneficial.
 DATA / Lal, you used a verbal contraction.
 DATA / It is a skill my program has never mastered.
 DATA / No. You have exceeded my abilities. I do not object. I just do not understand why it has happened.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Data. Please report to my Ready Room.
 DATA / (to comm) Yes, Captain.
 DATA / I am sure the admiral is anxious to meet Lal... I have been sending him regular status reports on her development...
 PICARD / His visit, Data, is not just an inspection of Lal's progress. He has expressed a concern for her environment.
 DATA / Her environment, sir?
 PICARD / He believes the Daystrom annex on Galor Four would be more suitable.
 DATA / He wishes to relocate us?
 PICARD / Not you, Data. Just Lal.
 DATA / I would not be in favor of that, Captain. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / There are many things she can learn only from me. My lifetime of experiences, the mistakes I have made and what I have learned from them...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain, Commander Riker's shuttle has just returned.
 PICARD / (to comm) Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Advise Mister Riker I'll want to meet with him in one hour. Picard out. (to Data) The admiral is taking the position that Lal's development should be overseen by the most experienced personnel available.
 DATA / Then he is questioning my ability as a parent.
 PICARD / In a manner of speaking...
 DATA / Does the admiral have children, sir?
 PICARD / I believe he does... why?
 DATA / I am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was born.
 RIKER / You're new around here, aren't you?
 DATA / Commander, what are your intentions toward my daughter?
 RIKER / I'm not... what... who... your daughter?
 RIKER / Nice to meet'cha...
 DATA / That is a limitation we must learn to accept, Lal.
 DATA / I have asked myself that many times as I have struggled to be more human, Lal. Until I finally realized that it is the struggle itself that is most important. We must strive to be better than we are. It does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal. The effort yields its own rewards.
 DATA / It is only the difference between knowledge and experience.
 PICARD / I beg your pardon, Admiral, but I thought you were sent here to form an opinion... not to justify one.
 PICARD / It need not be difficult at all. I understand your concerns. What I'm asking for is time, patience. If you keep an open mind, I know you'll see it is imperative to keep Data and Lal together. At least for the formative stages of her development. After that, I'm sure that Commander Data will be delighted to deliver her to Starfleet Research.
 PICARD / I'm convinced the damage would be irreparable if you separate them.
 PICARD / They are living, sentient beings. Their rights and privileges in our society have been defined. I helped define them.
 PICARD / A most significant step.
 PICARD / Which Commander Data is following.
 PICARD / That is a forced parallel, Admiral. M-5 was a battle computer.
 PICARD / I respect the need for peer review and control precautions. I would submit that you will find them here aboard the Enterprise. My crew has served for years with Data. Unlike your research people, we have enough such experience to reliably judge what is "normal" and "abnormal" behavior for Soong-type androids. We are uniquely qualified to assist in guiding Lal's development.
 DATA / So Lal now possesses the sum of my programming.
 DATA / There do seem to be variations on the quantum level. Lal can use contractions... I cannot.
 DATA / I have maintained records on positronic matrix activity, behavioral norms, and all verbal patterns... I have seen no evidence of other aberrations...
 PICARD / It would seem that you have actually improved upon yourself, Data.
 DATA / Is that not the goal of every parent, sir?
 DATA / I have been programmed with all the procedures you have mentioned. And in any meaningful evaluation of Lal, you would require a model for a basis of comparison. I am the only model available, Admiral.
 DATA / Nosir.
 PICARD / (cutting off a chance for Data to reply) On the other hand, Admiral, how many of your researchers are androids? None. And I would suggest that many aspects of Lal's existence and development may be so alien to human experience that your people simply could not be made to comprehend them.
 DATA / It is an opportunity for her to observe human behavior and more importantly to interact with her crewmates.
 PICARD / Admiral, she is working under the strict guidance of a woman in whom I have absolute trust. Ten-Forward is the center of the ship's social activity. Everyone on board comes here...
 PICARD / Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs Ten-Forward.
 PICARD / How is Lal doing, Guinan?
 PICARD / The Admiral is in fact suggesting you be moved to Galor Four, Lal.
 PICARD / The admiral is concerned that you need more guidance than your father can provide here on the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Why don't we, Admiral? In all these discussions, we've never once mentioned Lal's wishes. She's a free, sentient being. What are your wishes, Lal?
 PICARD / Thank you. You're excused.
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / Hello, Lal. How are you?
 TROI / You are scared, aren't you?
 TROI / I don't know.
 DATA / May I know why, sir?
 PICARD / That's a fine argument, Admiral. But it doesn't change my feeling that the proper place for Lal to develop is by Data's side.
 PICARD / This is not that time. The umbilical cord is virtually uncut. The child... (and this is the first time that Picard uses the word "child" comfortably, and he realizes it). ... the child depends on him.
 DATA / Admiral, when I created Lal, it was with the hope that someday she would choose to enter the Academy and become a member of Starfleet. I wanted to give something back in return for all Starfleet has given me. I still do. But Lal is my child. You ask that I volunteer to give her up. I cannot. That would violate every lesson I have learned about human parenting. (beat) As Captain Picard told me after he first met her, I have taken on "quite a responsibility." I have brought a new life into this world. It is my duty, not Starfleet's, to guide her through these first difficult steps to maturity, to support her as she learns, to prepare her to be a contributing member of society. No one can relieve me of that obligation. And I cannot ignore it. I am her father.
 PICARD / Belay that order, Commander.
 PICARD / I'll take the matter to Starfleet myself.
 PICARD / Hold your ground, Mister Data.
 PICARD / There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders. You acknowledge they are sentient, but ignore their personal liberty and freedom. Order a man to turn his child over to the state? Not while I am his captain. If you wish, the Enterprise is prepared to accompany you to Starfleet Command and then we'll see what...
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Troi to Commander Data. Report to your lab at once.
 PICARD / Acknowledged, Counselor. He's on his way. Is there a problem?
 TROI / Yes, Captain, something is terribly wrong with Lal.
 TROI (O.S.) / It lasted barely a moment. She experienced an extraordinary range of feelings... fear, excitement, pleasure... she could barely catch her breath... and then...
 TROI / For no apparent reason she got up and walked out of my quarters... she didn't say another word, she just started walking here... and each step became more and more difficult...
 DATA / Lal is programmed to return to the lab in the event of a malfunction.
 DATA / Yes, Lal. I am here.
 PICARD / (reacts, to Troi with sad irony) A malfunction. Emotional awareness.
 DATA / (to Haftel) It would appear to be a symptom of cascade failure. It will require reinitializing the base matrix without wiping out the higher functions.
 DATA / Thank you, Admiral.
 DATA / Lal, I am unable to correct the system failure.
 DATA / We must say good-bye now.
 DATA / What do you feel, Lal?
 DATA / I wish I could feel it with you.
 DATA / Lal suffered complete neural system failure at thirteen hundred hours. I have deactivated the unit.
 PICARD / The crew grieves for your loss, Mister Data.
 DATA / I thank you for your sympathy. But she is here. (indicates his head) Her presence so enriched my life that I could not allow her to pass into oblivion. So I incorporated her programs back into my own... I transferred her memories to me.
 PICARD / Mister Data, take your position.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Mister Crusher, set course for the starbase on Otar Two.
 WESLEY (O.S.) / Course set, sir.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Engage.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43685.2 As part of a continuing exchange program, the Enterprise is taking aboard a Klingon officer to return the recent visit of Commander Riker to the cruiser Pagh.
 PICARD and RIKER are walking along the corridor toward / the Transporter Room.
 PICARD / We must take care that while he is with us, Commander Kurn is accorded all the rights and responsibilities due the first officer of this ship. If he should feel patronized in any way...
 RIKER / We'd know about it, sir. One does not patronize a Klingon warrior.
 PICARD / I'm quite sure your experience aboard the Pagh will prove invaluable during the commander's tour. Be sure that the crew is prepared for any... unusual orders.
 RIKER / The Klingons are very thorough, Captain. I'm sure Commander Kurn has studied for his assignment with us just as I studied to serve with them.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) I understand that he specifically requested the Enterprise...
 PICARD / Energize.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Commander. I am Captain Picard.
 PICARD / This is Commander William Riker who will be yielding the first officer's position to you during your tour...
 RIKER / I thought that I might show you your quarters...
 PICARD / Very well... If you will accompany us to the bridge...
 WESLEY at Conn, WORF at Tactical, DATA in Command. Picard, / Riker and Kurn ENTER from the turbolift. Picard leads Kurn down into the Command area. Everyone watches to see the reaction as Worf and Kurn see each other for the first time. Worf is uncomfortable. Kurn runs his eyes over him... silently taking his measure of Worf... then looks away as if he'd seen nothing worth his time.
 PICARD / May I present your bridge crew...
 PICARD / (reacts) Proceed.
 PICARD / By all means, Commander.
 WESLEY / Nosir, Commander, sir.
 PICARD / (casually) Take us into the outer cometary cloud, Commander.
 WESLEY / (works console) Aye sir.
 WESLEY / (a little rattled) Engaged. Increasing to one-third impulse power, sir.
 RIKER / Mind if I join you?
 WESLEY / No, sir.
 RIKER / (sits down) Something wrong, Wesley?
 WESLEY / No, sir.
 RIKER / (beat) Commander Kurn perhaps?
 WESLEY / He... just doesn't seem to like me, sir. I can't do anything right for him. Every time I respond to one of his orders... he jumps down my throat. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
 RIKER / He's just...
 RIKER / Problem, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Well, sir... it's our new first officer.
 RIKER / (can't help but smile) I take it he found something wrong in Engineering?
 GEORDI / (exasperated) Just the entire section. He made a surprise inspection in the middle of a maintenance cycle! I tried to explain to him, but...
 RIKER / He wouldn't listen.
 GEORDI / We're all going to be doing double shifts to get things ready for the next inspection.
 RIKER / (to both of them) His style of command is just different. Klingons believe in a strict formality of command and obedience.
 GEORDI / But this isn't a Klingon ship. He's got to loosen up a little, Commander.
 WESLEY / It's not just us. He's leaning pretty hard on everybody except... (hesitates)
 GEORDI / Except the one guy who wouldn't mind it...
 WORF / Sensors picking up asteroidal debris ahead, Commander.
 WORF / Bearing zero-zero-one, mark point-oh-three, range three hundred thousand kilometers.
 WORF / Approximately two thousand small objects, none in our direct flight path, sir.
 WORF / (tightly) It should not be needed, Commander.
 RIKER / (greeting) Commander.
 RIKER / Captain's mess... ?
 RIKER / (to computer) Resume.
 RIKER / Your knowledge of our systems and procedures is very impressive... (off his look) ...Sir.
 RIKER / I would like to make one suggestion, sir.
 RIKER / When I served aboard the Pagh, the hardest part for me was in recognizing and adapting to the demands of the crew. They needed an iron hand. They wanted it. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / I can imagine how difficult it must be for you to work with a crew that is so different. I'd be happy to guide you in this regard if it would be helpful.
 RIKER / (a little burned) This is not a Klingon ship, sir.
 GEORDI / (reacts) It's not really dead, it's replicated. But you do understand we... cook many of our foods...
 PICARD / I have attempted to select a menu that will allow you to sample a variety of dishes, Commander.
 And indeed, the table is filled with a variety of foods... and garnished with a beautiful flower centerpiece... all the senior officers are there, filling up their plates... Riker, Geordi, Worf, BEVERLY, TROI, Data. Mozart is playing in the / background.
 BEVERLY / Try some caviar...
 DATA / The unhatched eggs of a large scaleless fish.
 PICARD / It is from the Caspian Sea on Earth, Commander. A delicacy and a personal favorite of mine. Our replicators have never done it justice. I managed to store a few cases aboard for special occasions...
 TROI / Are you adjusting to your new environment, Commander?
 PICARD / One of the goals of the exchange program is for all of us to learn tolerance, Commander. As for my crew, it may be healthy to shake up the status quo occasionally. Feel free to disagree, Mister Riker...
 RIKER / Well, I'd say the commander certainly has the crew on their toes...
 GEORDI / ... And then some. (quickly realizing his error, to Kurn) No offense meant, sir...
 BEVERLY / Don't you like it, Commander?
 GEORDI / It seems to agree with Worf.
 WORF / Permission to speak freely, sir?
 WORF / I have questions I wish to pose.
 WORF / They serve me.
 WORF / They are... of a personal nature, sir.
 WORF / I wish to know if I have given you offense.
 WORF / Perhaps I have not performed my duties to your satisfaction?
 WORF / Yet you dishonor me at every opportunity.
 WORF / (very tight) I am a Klingon.
 WORF / I am Klingon... if you doubt it, a demonstration can be arranged.
 WORF / The Starfleet officer that rescued me was told by the Klingon High Command that I had no living relatives.
 WORF / So you asked to serve aboard the Enterprise... to watch me.
 WORF / Your deception offends me, brother.
 WORF / To satisfy your curiosity.
 WORF / Challenge... ?
 PICARD / What are the allegations, Worf?
 WORF / My father is accused of aiding and abetting the Romulan attack on the Khitomer outpost.
 PICARD / The attack in which he himself was killed... ?
 WORF / It is a lie.
 PICARD / But why now... after twenty years?
 WORF / I do not know, Captain. I will hear the evidence when I arrive. The charge has been made by Duras, the son of my father's greatest rival. (beat) Our family name will be disgraced for seven generations. It is my responsibility to clear his name or answer for his crimes.
 PICARD / Answer for them?
 WORF / The family of a Klingon warrior is responsible for his actions and he is responsible for theirs. If I fail in my challenge, I will be executed. (beat) Will you grant my leave, Captain?
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / If I understand correctly, a Starfleet officer, a respected member of my crew could stand accused of a capital crime. Your actions in this matter reflect on this ship and the Federation. (beat, personal) Therefore, it seems only appropriate for your captain to be at your side as you make your challenge, Lieutenant. I'm sure you would do no less for me.
 PICARD / Commander Kurn...
 PICARD / We are changing course. Set coordinates for the First City of the Klingon Imperial Empire.
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / I know the procedures of the challenge.
 WORF / (formally) I ask you to stand with me... to be my cha'DIch.
 WORF / No. For the proceeding, you will not reveal your true father.
 WORF / (firm) You will not.
 WORF / On this ship, you are my commander. And I obey. In the council chamber, you are my cha'DIch. You do not insist. You obey.
 RIKER / (quietly to Picard) There was a time... when just standing here would have been a death sentence for us.
 WORF / Captain, I am honored that you... Commander Riker... Counselor Troi... have chosen to accompany me. Your presence will surely impress the council.
 PICARD / We're here as long as you need us, Worf.
 WORF / Once I make the challenge, I assume the sins of my father. I will be in disgrace until his innocence is proven. I would request that you not remain for the entire proceeding.
 TROI / You will never be a disgrace to us, Worf.
 PICARD / I understand. (to Kurn) You will advise us when it is appropriate to depart.
 WORF / (somber) It will be clear.
 WORF / I am Worf, son of Mogh. I have come to challenge the lies that have been spoken of my father.
 WORF / With my life, K'mpec.
 WORF / I have not forsaken my heritage. I am Klingon. My heart is of this world... my blood is as yours.
 PICARD / I am here at my own request. (moving forward, to council) I am Captain Picard of the Enterprise. I extend greetings on behalf of the Federation.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf has served under my command with distinction. He has earned my admiration and my respect. It is my greatest wish that this council in its wisdom will clear his family name and return him to duty.
 PICARD / (activates com badge) Picard to Enterprise. Three to beam up.
 PICARD / (quietly) Mister Data... I want you to find out everything you can about the destruction of the Khitomer outpost. Cross reference with Romulan tactics and strategic information on the region. Request access to the Klingon central information net. (on the move to Ready Room) Computer. Presentation overview of Klingon custom and law pertaining to familial accountability.
 PICARD / In my Ready Room.
 WORF / (coolly) It is a good day to die, Duras... and the day is not yet over.
 WORF / (not understanding) I am Klingon...
 WORF / My father...
 WORF / Why would you ask me to lay aside the honor of my father... my family... Are these the words of the council... ?
 DATA / The Klingon council is refusing to allow us access to their information net, Commander.
 RIKER / On what basis?
 DATA / Orders of a member of the council.
 RIKER / Duras...
 RIKER / What Federation starship was closest to Khitomer at the time of the attack?
 DATA / The USS Intrepid, sir. They were the first ship on the scene.
 RIKER / Contact Starfleet, request all logs of the Intrepid... (to Com) Riker to Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY / Crusher here...
 RIKER / Doctor, I want you to look over the medical records of all rescue vessels that responded to the Khitomer massacre... see if there is any information on the aftermath that could help us.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Understood.
 GEORDI / Uh, Commander, could I see you a moment...
 GEORDI / (lying) I was just making a few routine entries... and somehow, by accident, I just happened to... access the Klingon information net.
 DATA / How could you obtain access without the proper authorization codes?
 RIKER / I don't think we want to know, Data.
 Kurn is lying on the operating table, post op. A MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARY is checking on him using the / surgical clamshell. Beverly moves to Worf nearby. Worf's spirits are beginning to sag.
 BEVERLY / What kind of vicious weapon makes a wound like that... ?
 WORF / A kut'luch... the ceremonial weapon of an assassin.
 BEVERLY / Fortunately, his metabolic recovery is phenomenal... he'll be all right...
 WORF / It does not matter. We should have let him die.
 WORF / Now that Duras knows his bloodline, we will both be executed.
 BEVERLY / You sound like you've already lost, Worf.
 DATA / Commander, I have discovered the basis of the charges against Worf's father.
 DATA / Apparently the Klingons recently captured a Romulan ship with logs that provided new information on the Khitomer attack. They clearly indicate a transmission from the outpost to the Romulans moments before the shields dropped.
 GEORDI / From Worf's father?
 DATA / (calling something up) It does correspond to Mogh's personal security code.
 RIKER / How can we be sure these records haven't been falsified?
 GEORDI / We can cross check them against the Intrepid's sensor logs...
 DATA / (operating controls) I will try... but the Intrepid was at the edge of sensor range during the attack and we cannot be sure if the scans are complete.
 GEORDI / Looks like a pretty good match-up, Data...
 DATA / Both the Intrepid and Romulan logs show a series of distress signals from Khitomer...
 RIKER / What happens here...
 GEORDI / Gaps in the Intrepid logs, missing information because of the range...
 DATA / This is where Mogh's alleged transmission should be.
 RIKER / (frowns) Right in the middle of a gap.
 GEORDI / Wait a second, Data. Back up.
 GEORDI / Look at this... just before the Intrepid gap begins, the timebase of both files are in perfect sync... but look at the signals just after the shields dropped.
 DATA / They are no longer synchronous.
 GEORDI / Commander, somebody's been rewriting history.
 PICARD / I will not pretend to fully understand the nuances of your world's law or culture, Mister Worf. But I do understand when somebody is trying to hide something...
 WORF / (considering this) K'mpec urged me to drop my challenge, abandon my family honor... it was impossible to believe I was hearing a Klingon speak...
 PICARD / Obviously, they did not expect and never wanted this challenge... you're getting close to something, Lieutenant... something they care a great deal about protecting...
 WORF / If it is true, it is not just Duras but the High Council itself that is my enemy. (beat) Captain, I must choose a new cha'DIch. I would like your permission to ask a member of the crew.
 PICARD / Of course, Lieutenant. Ask whomever you wish.
 WORF / Sir, I would ask that you stand with me.
 WORF / (quickly) You may refuse... with no dishonor.
 PICARD / I appreciate the gesture, Lieutenant. But I know there are stronger, younger men from which to choose...
 WORF / A Klingon warrior knows that brute strength is not the most important asset in a fight. I have served under you in many conflicts... and know you to be a shrewd and forceful opponent. I can think of no one I would rather have at my side.
 PICARD / (perfectly pronounced) jIlajneS. ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj. I accept.
 WORF / (to Hall) My challenge will proceed. No threat, no treachery will stop it. (to Duras) Not even a trap for my cha'DIch set by a coward.
 PICARD / This is my place.
 WORF / He is now my cha'DIch.
 PICARD / I am not here to command.
 PICARD / You may test that assumption... at your convenience.
 BEVERLY / I've got something...
 BEVERLY / Worf was not the only survivor of the Khitomer massacre.
 RIKER / Another child?
 BEVERLY / No. A Klingon woman was found with Worf.
 RIKER / Kahlest... who was she?
 BEVERLY / I don't know. Just says here she had severe injuries... transferred to Starbase twenty-four for treatment. That's when she was separated from Worf. After she recovered, she returned home.
 RIKER / We've got to find her if she's still alive. Data, scan the Klingon central net... see if there's any record of her...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (hits com badge) Stand by.
 PICARD / (sotto voce) Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER / We've located another survivor of the Khitomer massacre, Captain... a woman who was found with Worf. Her name is Kahlest... she resides in the Old Quarter of the First City.
 PICARD / Well done. Picard out.
 PICARD / K'mpec.
 PICARD / May we have a... short recess?
 PICARD / Have you heard of a woman named Kahlest?
 WORF / She was my ghojmoK... my nurse.
 PICARD / Then it's possible she was an eyewitness to your father's activities at Khitomer...
 WORF / But she died in the attack---
 PICARD / She survived. She's living in the Old Quarter. I'm going to find her.
 WORF / It is too dangerous. You cannot go alone.
 PICARD / I am your cha'DIch.
 PICARD / Kahlest?
 PICARD / (toward direction of voice) Your help.
 PICARD / You don't even know what I want.
 PICARD / Then you know that Worf's life is at stake.
 PICARD / Were you with Worf's father just before the attack on Khitomer?
 PICARD / Worf is not gone, Kahlest. The family you served needs you again.
 PICARD / (quietly) Was his father a traitor?
 PICARD / Who? Who was the traitor?
 PICARD / We know a signal was sent to the Romulans just before the attack... if you were with Mogh and his family...
 PICARD / (sighs, concluding) Then, there is no way to prove Mogh's innocence, and Worf will die as the son of a traitor.
 PICARD / My appreciation, madam.
 PICARD / Kahlest, would they know who you are? Would they recognize you?
 PICARD / Then, come back with me. They do not know how much you know. Perhaps it will shake loose the truth.
 PICARD / The mek'ba is not complete. I bring an eyewitness to the Khitomer massacre... with new evidence, K'mpec.
 PICARD / (to Kahlest) Do not answer. (to K'mpec) Rules of the mek'ba require that her evidence be presented in open council.
 PICARD / Yes, Duras, it is your dishonor we are protecting here, isn't it?
 PICARD / Are you prepared to hear her evidence in open council, Duras?
 WORF / Why did you judge my father guilty when you knew he was not?
 WORF / (indicates Duras) This Ha'DIbaH (animal) should have been fed to the dogs!
 PICARD / Worf's challenge is successful. His family honor must be restored, K'mpec.
 PICARD / You admit the truth and still expect him to accept punishment. What does this say of an empire that holds honor so dear?
 PICARD / This is unacceptable, K'mpec.
 PICARD / I speak now as the captain of the USS Enterprise and Lieutenant Worf's commanding officer. You will not execute a member of my crew, sir. Nor will I turn his brother over to you.
 PICARD / The alliance with the Federation is not based on lies! Protect your secrets if you must, but do not sacrifice these men.
 WORF / I will die for the empire.
 PICARD / Lieutenant...
 WORF / The cha'DIch will be silent.
 WORF / Allow my brother to return to his life. Only you need know his true bloodline.
 WORF / If you allow him to live, I will give you something that will serve your purpose far more than my death. I will accept... discommendation.
 WORF / So be it.
 WORF / You... are the son of a traitor.
 WORF / I am ready.
 PICARD / Worf wants you to live... the name of your father must someday be cleared. He needs you alive... with your honor intact.
 PICARD / There will be another day, Commander. Do not forget what he does here today... do not let your children forget.
 WORF / tlhIH ghIj jIHyoj. (I fear your judgment)
 WORF / You must also...
 WORF / We will stand together... (sotto) ...brother.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43714.1. We have finally succeeded in eradicating the plague on Cor Caroli Five, and are now preparing to leave orbit and proceed to our next mission --
 PICARD is relaxing on a recliner-type chair, reading / an antique leather-bound book. An empty brandy snifter is nearby. CLASSICAL MUSIC plays softly.
 PICARD (V.O.) / -- a rendezvous with the USS Hood to assist their terraforming efforts on Browder Four.
 RIKER, WORF, DATA, and supernumeraries are at their / posts. Data reacts to something on his console.
 DATA / Commander, ship's sensors detect an abnormal energy reading in the captain's quarters.
 RIKER / Type?
 DATA / Undetermined.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to Captain Picard.
 WORF / Security team to captain's quarters --
 PICARD / Picard to Enterprise.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Anyone receiving this transmission, please respond.
 WORF / Security override. Priority one.
 PICARD / It's all right. I'm not going to hurt you.
 PICARD / (nods) Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, I can't, Mister...
 PICARD / Well, Mister Tholl, all I know is that I've been brought here against my will. (gestures) Wherever "here" is...
 PICARD / (to Tholl) And you, sir?
 PICARD / What can you tell me about our captors?
 PICARD / Four sleeping areas... that implies we'll be joined by another captive...
 PICARD / Food?
 PICARD / Why not?
 PICARD / Punished -- how?
 PICARD / Of course they will. They'll do everything they can. In the meantime, we keep our heads... (wryly indicating the room) ... and enjoy the hospitality.
 WORF / Sir, the Hood has arrived at the rendezvous point. They are expecting us in thirty-six hours.
 DATA / Correct, sir.
 DATA / A great deal, sir. It is a rotating neutron star of approximately four point three five six solar masses.
 WESLEY / At warp seven... thirty-four minutes.
 WESLEY / Sir?
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 WESLEY (cont'd) / Sir, at warp two -- we'll arrive at the pulsar in thirty-one hours...
 RIKER / Captain, are we delaying our rendezvous with the Hood?
 RIKER / Mister Worf, contact the Hood and inform them of our delay.
 WORF / Aye, Commander.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 WESLEY / Data -- any guesses as to what this is all about?
 DATA / I see no point in randomly selecting alternative motivations for the captain's actions considering that not enough information has been offered to make any one "guess" superior to another.
 WESLEY / In other words, you don't know either.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Don't worry about me, sir. I can handle it.
 RIKER / You can count on us all, sir.
 PICARD / Attempting to show our captors that we possess intelligence.
 PICARD / They may not realize we are communicating through language.
 PICARD / To get their attention.
 PICARD / I'll take the chance. It's imperative that we communicate with our abductors... find out what they want.
 PICARD / Obviously. But why? What made our captors choose us? What makes us special?
 PICARD / (points out) You're a Bolian. There are very few Bolians in Starfleet.
 PICARD / What's your best area of study?
 PICARD / Good enough to be useful to our abductors?
 PICARD / That, I can't answer. (a beat) The Bolians are maintaining an uneasy truce with the Moropa, are they not?
 PICARD / (surprised) None? In the last three hundred years of Mizarian history, your planet has been conquered six times!
 PICARD / Then you have no idea who might have done this.
 PICARD / Or against you personally?
 PICARD / I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up with an explanation for your abduction.
 PICARD / Nonetheless, Mister Tholl --
 PICARD / It would seem a new arrival is imminent...
 PICARD / Stop! We mean you no harm...
 PICARD / We are prisoners, like yourself! We are not the enemy!
 PICARD / We don't know. We were brought here the same way you were. Our captors refuse to show themselves.
 PICARD / You must trust us. We wish only to return to our worlds. Were you abducted from Chalna?
 PICARD / Yes. I visited there twelve years ago.
 RIKER / Your five... and twenty more.
 GEORDI / Ouch.
 TROI / If it's too rich, fold.
 GEORDI / I'm thinking, I'm thinking...
 WORF / Think less, play more.
 RIKER / I say he folds.
 DATA / I believe you are incorrect, Commander.
 DATA (Cont'd) / In situations where more than two players have asked for three cards and the minimum raise was ten, Geordi has stayed in the game seventy-three percent of the time.
 RIKER / I still say he folds.
 GEORDI / I don't want to hurt my average.
 DATA / Enter.
 DATA / You are always welcome, Captain.
 RIKER / Bet is twenty-five to you, Lieutenant.
 WORF / You are bluffing.
 WORF (cont'd) / So was I.
 GEORDI / Operating at ninety-three percent, sir.
 GEORDI / I'll get on it right away, sir.
 GEORDI / No problem, sir. (regarding the game) Lady Luck left me long ago.
 TROI / Would you care to join us, sir? We have an opening.
 RIKER / Of course not. (to Troi) Your bet, Counselor.
 RIKER / Pair of threes.
 TROI / Flush. Queen high.
 DATA / That beats my three fours.
 TROI / Certainly, sir.
 RIKER / (in fun) Take your time, sir... she's won almost every hand.
 TROI / I've sensed no unusual reaction, Captain.
 TROI (cont'd) / After all -- such a change is hardly out of the ordinary.
 TROI / Curious, yes -- concerned, no. They trust you.
 TROI / Sir?
 TROI / I'd inform you, sir... of course.
 PICARD / Has it a meaning?
 PICARD / (intervenes) Esoqq -- I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy... someone who'd have reason to confine us here.
 PICARD / You have many enemies?
 PICARD / Both of you -- this is getting us nowhere.
 PICARD / (unruffled) Quite a while, Mister Tholl. And I'm perfectly willing to entertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans. (a beat) But what would Romulans want with you?
 PICARD / Food.
 PICARD / It would seem so.
 PICARD / Esoqq -- how long can you go without food?
 PICARD / No longer?
 BEVERLY / All tests indicate the same result -- you're in great shape.
 BEVERLY / I see. (a beat) Then why did you come in? Your annual physical wasn't due for another month.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc -- be honest with your doctor. Were there any symptoms or warning signs you haven't told me about?
 BEVERLY / Well, then... return to your post.
 BEVERLY / In Ten-Forward?
 BEVERLY / You're full of surprises today, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / It's imperative.
 PICARD / We can no longer afford to be patient. If we don't act soon, Esoqq will starve...
 PICARD / I agree we're taking a risk. But I see no alternative.
 PICARD / As you wish, Mister Tholl. (eyeing the wall) We must open this panel.
 PICARD / Haro -- stand back.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 BEVERLY / Out with it, Jean-Luc.
 BEVERLY / Whatever's been on your mind all evening long.
 BEVERLY / After all this time, I ought to.
 BEVERLY / We've both made choices...
 BEVERLY / (nods understanding) Our positions necessitate a degree of professional detachment...
 BEVERLY / (direct) Is that what you want, Jean-Luc? To get closer?
 BEVERLY / And you're a very attractive man. But we both know it's not as simple as that.
 BEVERLY / Simpler, perhaps, but... that's not the only issue. (beat) Right now, I guess, I'm comfortable with our relationship the way it is.
 BEVERLY / All right.
 BEVERLY / So did I...
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, if I didn't know you better... I'd think you were playing games with me.
 BEVERLY / I didn't say that.
 PICARD / Tholl -- our captors have transporters and stun beams. I hardly think they'd try to keep us at bay with a knife.
 PICARD / Tholl -- I asked her to open the door.
 PICARD / What I want is for all of us to escape.
 PICARD / Cor Caroli Five...
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, supplemental. Although we're still two hundred million kilometers from the Lonka pulsar, the Captain has ordered us to slow to one-half impulse.
 RIKER (V.O.) / He has offered no explanation.
 RIKER / I don't understand why we're going to this pulsar. And creeping up on it at half impulse makes even less sense...
 TROI / The captain's given unusual orders before...
 RIKER / I know... but this time it's different. He's different. I can't put my finger on it... but I'm worried.
 TROI / The captain does seem... detached from his emotions.
 GEORDI / Thank you, sir.
 WORF / Of course, Captain.
 WORF / An unusual tradition.
 GEORDI / Commander... What's the captain up to?
 RIKER / That's not the captain I know...
 RIKER / ... We have a mission that has no apparent purpose... by itself, I can accept that, all of us can... because the captain says it is important and we trust him... Then he runs the crew through efficiency drills for the first time in my tour of duty... but if he says we need them, we need them... because we trust the captain. But we also have a captain singing drinking songs with his men...
 GEORDI / ... a captain who's come to the poker game for the first time...
 TROI / And he was very odd with me afterwards... he asked me to warn him if the crew started to lose confidence in him...
 RIKER / (to Troi) Any signs of mental stress or trauma?
 BEVERLY / He came in for a physical without a word from me...
 WORF / Anything unusual, doctor?
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head) He was in perfect health... every test result identical to his last physical... that's kind of unusual in itself, actually...
 RIKER / It's almost as though he wanted to establish that there was nothing wrong with him.
 BEVERLY / There was one... other... thing...
 BEVERLY / He asked me to his cabin for dinner... I think he tried to seduce me.
 RIKER / Which brings us to a most serious possibility -- is there an outside influence at work here...
 TROI / I can detect no evidence of telepathic coercion.
 DATA / Commander, there is one other fact we have not considered. The abnormal energy reading in the captain's quarters that was never explained.
 WORF / It is not enough evidence to justify mutiny.
 RIKER / Worf -- nobody has suggested removing the captain from command.
 WORF / Nobody has yet.
 BEVERLY / And nobody will -- unless we have solid evidence that the captain is unfit for duty.
 RIKER / Right now, all we have are suspicions... not enough to act upon. The next move is his.
 PICARD / I can't.
 PICARD (cont'd) / You're right, Tholl. Any of us could be the enemy. And there's no way to prove we aren't.
 PICARD (cont'd) / But unless we set aside our mutual fears and trust one another, we have no hope of escape.
 PICARD / And what if there is, Mister Tholl? Shall we continue accusing one another until hostility leads to violence? Shall we allow our suspicions to destroy us?
 PICARD / Let's see if we can deactivate that stun mechanism...
 WESLEY / Orbiting the pulsar at fifty million kilometers, sir.
 DATA / The pulsar is exactly as our records indicate. There appear to be no anomalies or significant changes since the last scan by a Federation ship.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, divert enough power to the shields to offset the increased radiation and magnetic fields.
 DATA / Sir, at twenty million kilometers our shields will be effective for only eighteen minutes --
 RIKER / Captain, may I have a word with you?
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / What is our mission?
 RIKER / If you don't -- you force me to take command of this vessel.
 RIKER / You're endangering this ship... for no reason.
 RIKER / That's not good enough. Your behavior has been erratic --
 RIKER / No, I don't. But I can't let you risk the lives of the crew.
 PICARD / That would appear to be the power lead to the stun device.
 PICARD / I don't think it will be. Esoqq -- your knife, please.
 PICARD (cont'd) / You assured me you'd cooperate.
 PICARD / Mister Tholl...
 DATA / Captain -- number four shield has failed. Increasing power to number three shield to compensate.
 DATA / Sir -- at that distance, the ship will not withstand the magnetic fields and radiation.
 RIKER / Belay that order.
 RIKER / Maintain your position, Lieutenant.
 RIKER / I'll take that chance.
 RIKER / You've shown none of the concerns that Captain Picard would show... the safety of this ship, the welfare of its crew...
 RIKER / Mister Crusher -- take us away from the pulsar, heading one-eight-five mark three-two, full impulse.
 WESLEY / Full impulse -- aye, Commander.
 RIKER / Engage.
 PICARD / I think this charade has gone far enough, don't you?
 PICARD / Yes, you do. This isn't a holding cell; it's a laboratory maze -- and we're the white rats. A carefully concocted test... an experiment to see how we'd react under pressure.
 PICARD / It's the only explanation. Look at the four of us... we do have something in common: we all react differently to authority. (to Esoqq) You, the anarchist, reject authority in any form... (to Tholl) ... you, the collaborator, defer to whoever's in control... (re himself) ... I, a Starfleet Captain, am trained to command... (to Haro) ... and you, a cadet, have sworn to obey a superior officer's authority. (a beat) Our captors put us here and devised obstacles for us to overcome. We were given food Esoqq couldn't eat -- to make him a threat. We were given a door that wouldn't open -- until all four of us cooperated. And each time we succeeded, we were dealt a reversal -- to set us against each other again. (to Haro) While you observed our reactions.
 PICARD / I found it unlikely that a first-year cadet would know of the Enterprise's visit to Mintaka Three... so I tested you. Starfleet has classified the Cor Caroli Five plague "secret." No cadet would have knowledge of the incident.
 PICARD / You may as well drop the pretense. I refuse to play along any further -- I'm quitting the game. As far as I'm concerned, this experiment is over.
 PICARD / (nods grimly) And an impostor running my ship.
 RIKER / Captain!
 PICARD / Hold your positions. Take no action.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Why did you choose to study the concepts of authority and leadership?
 PICARD / You had no right to put us through this just to satisfy your curiosity.
 PICARD / Because kidnapping is immoral. The lives of other races must be respected.
 PICARD / (turning to Riker) Number One?
 RIKER / Now, Mister Worf.
 PICARD / Because there's something more you can learn from us. With an alert crew, even our "primitive vocal communications" are unnecessary. Commander Riker understood I wished to hold you here... (indicates Data) ... he had Mister Data scan you and pass the information to our security officer... (indicates Worf) ... who devised a forcefield that would entrap you.
 PICARD / I've decided to perform an experiment of my own. I want to see how you react to being imprisoned.
 PICARD / Captivity is an injury, regardless of how it's justified.
 PICARD (cont'd) / And now that you've had a taste of captivity, perhaps you'll reconsider the morality of inflicting it upon others. (shrugs) In any event, we now know about your race -- and we know how to imprison you. Bear that in mind. (a beat) Now get off my ship.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher. Set course for our rendezvous with the Hood... Warp eight.
 WESLEY / Aye aye, sir. (a beat) It's good to have you back.
 PICARD / Status, Number One?
 RIKER / Ship and crew functioning normally, Captain.
 PICARD / Then my doppelganger caused no serious damage. (a beat) Was the replica convincing?
 RIKER / Very convincing, sir -- but not perfect.
 PICARD / Not perfect in what way?
 RIKER / Well, sir... (a beat) ... for one, I simply cannot believe you're that good a singer.
 PICARD / A singer?
 PICARD (cont'd) / I look forward to reading your report, Commander. At least, I think I do.
 BEVERLY / Captain.
 PICARD / Doctor...
 WESLEY / Course laid in, Captain.
 PICARD / Engage.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, Stardate 43745.2. We are in orbit of Gemaris Five where, for the past two weeks, Captain Picard has been serving as mediator in a trade dispute between the Gemarians and their nearest neighbor, the Dachlyds.
 DATA at Ops, ENSIGN BENNETT at Conn, WORF at Tactical. / RIKER standing by Command. / 
 RIKER / Welcome back, Counselor.
 TROI / It's good to be back. It's been a grueling two weeks.
 RIKER / I take it the captain was able to negotiate an agreement mutually beneficial to both parties.
 TROI / He did. Though I don't know how he managed it. Both the Gemarians and the Dachlyds are incredibly stubborn people.
 RIKER / The more difficult the task, the sweeter the victory.
 PICARD / Break us out of orbit, Mister Bennett. Set a course for Starbase twelve.
 PICARD / (continuing) Report, Number One.
 RIKER / Everything status quo, sir.
 PICARD / Very well...
 PICARD / (continuing) If anyone needs me, I'll be in my Ready Room.
 RIKER / Sir...
 RIKER / (continuing) Congratulations.
 PICARD / About what?
 RIKER / (continuing) Counselor, is it my imagination or is something bothering the captain?
 TROI / He has been under a great deal of strain lately. While on Gemaris he ate sparingly... and slept even less.
 RIKER / Is there anything we can do?
 TROI / I have a solution in mind, but I doubt he'll agree to it.
 RIKER / And what would that be?
 TROI / (simply) Our captain needs a vacation.
 PICARD / Come.
 BEVERLY ENTERS. A woman with a mission. / 
 BEVERLY / Sir, it's come to my attention one of the crew has been neglecting his health again.
 PICARD / How so?
 BEVERLY / He suffers from a classic case of stress related ailments brought about by overwork. Exhaustion, irritability... muscle spasms. Yet he insists on ignoring them.
 PICARD / It doesn't sound all that serious.
 BEVERLY / And I plan to keep it that way.
 PICARD / Recommended treatment.
 BEVERLY / A week's shore leave.
 PICARD / Impossible.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc... I could make it an order.
 PICARD / But you won't... Beverly you know I loathe vacations.
 BEVERLY / You loathe going on vacation. Once you're there you have a marvelous time. You told me you loved the four days you spent on Zytchin Three.
 PICARD / I lied. (an idea) The Enterprise is scheduled to spend a week undergoing a maintenance overhaul at Starbase twelve. While there, I promise to make full use of all available recreation activities.
 BEVERLY / Watching some technician fill deuterium tanks is not my idea of fun.
 PICARD / I suppose I could find a few hours to spend on the Holodeck.
 BEVERLY / Forget about the Holodeck. There must be someplace you'd like to go.
 PICARD / The Astrophysics Center on Icor Nine is holding a symposium on rogue star clusters. I had given serious thought to attending.
 BEVERLY / Serious thought is the last thing you need. Why not go some place beautiful? Where you can relax and be pampered. You deserve it.
 PICARD / I'll give it serious thought.
 BEVERLY / (insistent) Captain...
 PICARD / Beverly... enough.
 RIKER / So have you decided where you're going yet?
 Continuous. PICARD / Yes Number One, I have. (to computer) The bridge.
 RIKER / I meant for your shore leave.
 PICARD / Not you too.
 RIKER / (to computer) Halt.
 RIKER / (continuing) I know this perfect little vacation spot... In fact, its co-ordinates lie within this sector.
 PICARD / How convenient. Except I have absolutely no intention of taking a holiday. Do I make myself clear?
 RIKER / Very clear...
 PICARD / Good. I'm glad we've got that straightened out. (to computer) Resume.
 RIKER / It's called Risa. And believe me Captain, it's paradise. Warm tropical breezes... exotic food... and nothing to do but sit back and enjoy the quiet. (a beat) And then there's --
 PICARD & RIKER / (together) ... the women...
 PICARD / ... of course.
 RIKER / I'm sure you'd find their sybaritic outlook on life very appealing.
 PICARD / I'm sure I would.
 RIKER / I'm glad to hear you say so, sir.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, this vessel is about to undergo extensive repairs requiring my personal supervision.
 RIKER / But what about Risa?
 PICARD / Some other time, Number One.
 TROI / Will, I've just received some delightful news.
 RIKER / Really?
 TROI / There's an excellent chance my mother may be meeting us at Starbase twelve.
 PICARD / Your mother?
 TROI / Yes, she's returning home from a conference on Achrady Seven. She's going to try to rearrange her schedule so she can spend some time visiting with us.
 RIKER / That's wonderful, Deanna.
 TROI / She mentioned how much she's looking forward to seeing you again, Captain.
 PICARD / Did she?
 PICARD / Commander, I'd like a word with you. In private.
 RIKER / Is something wrong, Captain?
 PICARD / Tell me, Number One, is the entire crew aware of this little scheme to send me off on holiday?
 RIKER / (fighting back a smile) I believe there are two ensigns stationed on deck thirty-nine who know nothing about it.
 PICARD / I suppose this means I can look forward to a week of continual harassment on the subject.
 PICARD / I admit I have been feeling a bit fatigued.
 RIKER / I'll see to it that these bags are beamed directly to your room.
 TROI / You look very handsome, Captain... If you don't mind my saying so.
 RIKER / You're not really bringing all these books with you?
 PICARD / I thought I'd take along some light reading... in case I got bored.
 RIKER / Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics, Sophistry and the Alternate Universe by Ving Kuda -- You call this light reading?
 PICARD / To each his own, Number One.
 RIKER / Did I ever mention how imaginative Risian women are?
 TROI / Too often, Commander.
 RIKER / Captain, I do have one request.
 PICARD / You want me to bring you back a souvenir?
 RIKER / It's called a Horga'hn. You won't have any trouble finding one.
 PICARD / Consider it done.
 WORF and a security guard are waiting outside the / Transporter Room.
 WORF / Sir, I would feel better if you would allow me to assign a security officer to accompany you. We will be out of communication range as soon as we leave orbit.
 PICARD / I don't think that will be necessary, Lieutenant. Risa has a reputation of being a most peaceful planet.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / The ship is yours, Number One.
 TROI / Enjoy your trip, Captain.
 PICARD / I'll try, Counselor.
 RIKER / He's going to have a great time.
 PICARD / Pardon me.
 PICARD / I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
 PICARD / (to himself) A simple handshake would have sufficed.
 PICARD / So it would seem.
 PICARD / No. It's just that you're the fifth woman to ask me that this morning... All I require is to sit here in the sun and read my book. Alone.
 PICARD / I really haven't thought that far ahead.
 PICARD / Some other time perhaps.
 PICARD / I just purchased that. (suddenly suspicious) Why? Are you implying it holds some special meaning?
 PICARD / (softly but emphatically) Riker!
 PICARD / I don't even know what it means. (quickly) Nor do I want to. The Horga'hn is for a friend.
 PICARD / That's right.
 PICARD / I wouldn't go that far.
 PICARD / That's all I ask.
 PICARD (V.O.) / You're blocking the sun.
 PICARD / Are you addressing me?
 PICARD / I don't know what the devil you're talking about. But whatever it is, I assure you it's no concern of mine.
 PICARD / Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. You have the wrong man.
 PICARD / You'll find Ferengi demands carry little weight with me.
 PICARD / On the contrary, I have. All too often.
 PICARD / Or trusted.
 PICARD / I advise you to listen closely for I will not say this again. I came to Risa for a holiday, nothing more. I have no knowledge of this woman you refer to, nor have I laid eyes on any disc.
 PICARD / (with an edge) I don't particularly care what you believe.
 PICARD / Oh, it's you.
 PICARD / Look, I don't mean to appear rude, but I am not seeking Jamaharohn.
 PICARD / If I "try it", it will be at a time of my own choosing.
 PICARD / I assumed by the way you welcomed me the other day...
 PICARD / I don't recall saying I was embarrassed.
 PICARD / Let's just say I prefer to be acquainted with the women I kiss.
 PICARD / Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / (scowling) Is that really necessary?
 PICARD / I'm captain of a Federation starship.
 PICARD / Explains what?
 PICARD / You're the woman he was talking about?
 PICARD / For the answer to that I suggest you ask him.
 PICARD / To find some privacy.
 PICARD / I don't. And I don't want to.
 PICARD / It would seem you two have a lot to discuss. If you'll excuse me...
 PICARD / Perhaps you can.
 PICARD / What are you doing in my room?
 PICARD / Let's assume for the moment I believe you. That you are indeed from the future. What is it that you want from me?
 PICARD / I'm aware of the legend. It tells of a visitor from the future who left behind a mysterious device known as the Tox Uthat.
 PICARD / Then the Uthat actually exists.
 PICARD / But why bring such a powerful weapon into the past?
 PICARD / I gather you were unsuccessful.
 PICARD / And the search led you to me?
 PICARD / I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I haven't found a thing -- including peace, which is the only thing I'm looking for.
 PICARD / And if I do find it, what then?
 PICARD / The Uthat belongs to your time -- not mine.
 PICARD (V.O.) / May I come in?
 PICARD / Is this what he's looking for?
 PICARD / This disc must contain some very valuable information.
 PICARD / That depends.
 PICARD / On whether or not this has anything to do with the Tox Uthat.
 PICARD / Let's just say I've heard... rumors that the Uthat is located somewhere on Risa.
 PICARD / Then it's true.
 PICARD / As a matter of fact, I have. He spent half his life searching for the Uthat. (off her reaction) Archaeology is a hobby of mine.
 PICARD / So you're continuing his work?
 PICARD / With a Ferengi as an associate.
 PICARD / But the two of you are well acquainted.
 PICARD / And now with typical Ferengi logic, he's convinced that the Uthat belongs to him.
 PICARD / I take it you have a more noble purpose in mind.
 PICARD / Then I'll go in your place.
 PICARD / You'll remain here. It's safer.
 PICARD / From the moment we met I knew you were going to be trouble.
 PICARD / How far is it to our destination?
 PICARD / I'll meet you in the lobby in fifteen minutes. Be punctual. (a beat) I advise you to change clothing.
 PICARD / Didn't anyone tell you weapons aren't allowed on Risa?
 PICARD / You are becoming quite an annoyance, Sovak.
 PICARD / We have a long trip ahead of us.
 PICARD / Have you calculated how much further we have to go?
 PICARD / We'll remain here for the night.
 PICARD / We made better time than I expected.
 PICARD / As it was intended.
 PICARD / Forgive me if I don't act surprised.
 PICARD / Then you did steal it.
 PICARD / But you took Sovak's money.
 PICARD / Well, any woman who can beat a Ferengi at his own game, bears watching.
 PICARD / (gruffly) We should get some sleep.
 PICARD / That happens to be why I came to Risa.
 PICARD / Excitement? Sleeping in a damp cave... chasing after something we'll probably never find?
 PICARD / I suppose I am.
 PICARD / Good. Now go to sleep.
 PICARD / That was a simple misunderstanding.
 PICARD / You can be the most irritating woman sometimes.
 PICARD / You call this getting along?
 PICARD / Do I?
 PICARD / I'm sure of it.
 PICARD / Do you have an exact location?
 PICARD / That should put it right about here.
 PICARD / Is something wrong?
 PICARD / That leaves us but one alternative.
 PICARD / Shall we?
 PICARD / (seeing it's the Vorgons) A bit early, aren't you?
 PICARD / They're security officers from the twenty-seventh century. They're here to take back the Uthat.
 PICARD / My apologies Vash... But if I had told you, would you have brought me here?
 PICARD / My point exactly.
 PICARD / (coldly to Sovak) How did you get here?
 PICARD / I see no reason to continue.
 PICARD / Look around Sovak, by now it must be obvious even to you... the Uthat is not here.
 PICARD / It would appear so.
 PICARD / (firmly) It's over, Sovak.
 PICARD / There are other treasures to be found, Vash.
 PICARD / I quite understand.
 RIKER (COM VOICE) / Enterprise to Picard.
 PICARD / Picard here.
 RIKER / I hope we're not interrupting anything important, Captain. I just wanted to inform you that we have achieved orbit around Risa and are ready to beam you up at your convenience.
 PICARD / I will be returning shortly, Commander. In the interim, stand ready to initiate Transporter Code Fourteen at my signal.
 RIKER / Transporter Code Fourteen?
 PICARD / You heard me, Number One.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Picard out.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Leaving so soon?
 PICARD / Well then, I've saved you the bother.
 PICARD / Of course. However, there is one last thing you can do for me.
 PICARD / Show me where you've hidden the Tox Uthat.
 PICARD / You never intended to burn that second disc. If you had, you wouldn't have been so careless as to allow Sovak to salvage any of it. You wanted him to follow us so he could see for himself that the Uthat wasn't at the cave site. It was the only way to convince him your quest had been futile.
 PICARD / Because you had gone there once before. Probably the moment you arrived on the planet. That's when you found it.
 PICARD / A very dangerous piece. Were you really going to give it to the Daystom Institute?
 PICARD / I assume the Vorgons have proof to back up their claims.
 PICARD / You're going to have to prove you are who you say you are.
 PICARD / But not necessarily to you.
 PICARD / Enterprise... Code Fourteen... Lock on present coordinates... three second delay... Mark!
 PICARD / Are you all right?
 PICARD / (forcefully) Go. Return to your own time. There's nothing for you here.
 PICARD / (smiling) Somehow I doubt you'd find life aboard a starship suitable to your taste.
 PICARD / What are your plans?
 PICARD / But the Sarthongians deal harshly with trespassers.
 PICARD / You will try and stay out of trouble.
 PICARD / (smiling) Perhaps we do. (off her questioning look) The Vorgons are time travelers. Now that they know where and when the Uthat can be found, they may very well come back and try for it again.
 PICARD / Picard to Transporter Room. One to beam up.
 RIKER / Welcome aboard, Captain.
 PICARD / Thank you, Commander. Status report.
 RIKER / All went well on Starbase twelve. I think you'll find the ship to be in splendid condition.
 PICARD / I'll present my compliments to the crew. Oh yes... and Number One... about that Horga'hn you requested.
 RIKER / (feigning innocence) Yes, sir...
 PICARD / We need to have a little chat about that.
 TROI / Was it a relaxing trip, Captain?
 RIKER / (beaming) I knew he'd have a great time.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43779.3. The Enterprise is preparing detailed atmospheric charts of the Hayashi system. Although tedious, this endeavor is the first step toward planet colonization.
 PICARD and RIKER at Command. WORF and TROI are at / their stations. DATA and WESLEY are at Ops and Conn.
 DATA / Sensors report the USS Hood closing on an intercept course at high warp.
 PICARD / That's odd... I wasn't notified of a rendezvous.
 RIKER / They seem to be in an awful hurry.
 WORF / Sir, we are being hailed on a secured channel by Captain DeSoto.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Robert, why didn't you inform us --
 PICARD / So, old friend. How are you?
 PICARD / But not today.
 PICARD / If time is so important, why didn't they transmit the orders by subspace?
 PICARD / What sort of passenger?
 RIKER / (startled) Elbrun? You mean Tam Elbrun as in the Ghorusda disaster?
 DATA / Sir, the Hood is slowing to impulse.
 PICARD / Mister Data, come with me --
 TROI / Captain, let me come with you to greet Tam --
 PICARD / You know him?
 TROI / I do... He was at the university on Betazed when I studied psychology there.
 PICARD / Ah, I see. He was a colleague, then.
 TROI / No, sir. He was a patient...
 TROI / Tam is a telepath of extraordinary talent, even for a Betazoid. He's a specialist in first contact with new life-forms, and... a rather unique person. (a beat) He's not what you might expect, Captain.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm --
 TROI / (embarrassed by Tam's tactlessness, she still can't help smiling) Fine, but Tam, I...
 DATA / Sir --
 DATA / (puzzled) My name is Data.
 PICARD / Number One?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker here.
 PICARD / Meet Mister Data on the bridge. He has our orders and new heading.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (continuing) And assemble the bridge staff for a mission briefing in -- fifteen minutes. Picard out. (to Tam) Mister Elbrun. Would you --
 GEORDI / I've heard something about Ghorusda. Weren't about forty people killed --
 RIKER / Forty-seven, including the captain of the Adelphi -- and two friends from my class at the Academy.
 GEORDI / Sorry. What happened?
 RIKER / It was a first contact situation.
 RIKER / The Ghorusdans values are so complex, and so different, that the Federation sent along a specialist. To prevent misunderstanding.
 GEORDI / That was Tam Elbrun? And what happened was his fault?
 RIKER / Not directly. Board of inquiry blamed Captain Darson's carelessness about Ghorusdan cultural taboos. (pause) But if Elbrun's so good, why didn't he warn Darson? What was he there for, if he couldn't sense that much hostility?
 DATA / Commander, Geordi... do you ever feel as if I am not "there?" That is to say... not "here."
 GEORDI / You seem to be all here.
 DATA / Our destination is the Beta Stromgren system, following the path of the Vega Nine probe.
 RIKER / That's twenty-three parsecs beyond our furthest manned explorations.
 DATA / That is correct, Commander. Apparently the probe has discovered... (a beat, reacting to something he sees on the screen) ...Astonishing.
 DATA / This is the star Beta Stromgren...
 DATA / (continuing) Scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of an alternating cycle of expansion and collapse, which will soon result in a supernova. (beat) However, the long-range unmanned probe which Starfleet sent to observe the process has discovered something much more --
 GEORDI / Looks like a ship of some kind.
 PICARD / (immediately fascinated) Alive? How so?
 GEORDI / A cybernetic organism -- like the Borg?
 RIKER / Have attempts been made --
 TROI / The opportunity for discovery is extraordinary -- but I don't yet understand Starfleet's urgency --
 PICARD / The Romulans --
 PICARD / They claim the sector of space in which Beta Stromgren is located.
 WORF / The Romulans claim all that is within their field of vision.
 DATA / And they routinely monitor the telemetry of our deep-space probes.
 PICARD / So it's quite certain they'll be sending a ship of their own to investigate this Tin Man.
 DATA / That is correct. Starbase one twenty-three detected two D'daridex class cruisers on an intercept course. (to Picard) The top speed of this class vessel is known to be less than our own, sir. We therefore have some advantage.
 PICARD / So, it's a race? (thoughtfully) An alien intelligence -- a new life-form -- representing a technology far beyond that of either the Romulans or ourselves. The Romulans will take whatever measures -- military or otherwise -- are required to secure the creature for study.
 GEORDI / Study as in dissect, I'd bet.
 PICARD / Data, you're our resident honor student in exobiology. I'm assigning you to head up life sciences on this mission.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Meeting adjourned, then.
 PICARD / Mister Elbrun -- one reason I want you to work closely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further... omissions. The possibility of an encounter with Romulans on this mission is hardly trivial. Yet you --
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43782.6. Travelling at top warp, we are still several days from rendezvous with the mysterious entity which Starfleet has christened Tin Man.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) My immediate concern is with Tam Elbrun. Starfleet considers his unique abilities crucial to our mission. Yet he seems to me... unstable.
 BEVERLY / Well, according to his medical records and psych profile, he's very high on the ESP scale. A sort of prodigy.
 PICARD / A prodigy? In what sense?
 TROI / In most Betazoids their telepathic gifts develop at adolescence.
 PICARD / They're not born reading minds?
 TROI / No. Except... for some reason that no one understands, occasionally a Betazoid child is born different.
 PICARD / How "different?"
 TROI / Born with their telepathic abilities "switched on." Most Betazoids born like that never lead a normal life.
 BEVERLY / (understanding now) The noise of other people's thoughts and feelings must be... overwhelming. Incomprehensible... especially for a child.
 TROI / And painful. Early diagnosis and special training helped Tam adjust -- but he has some problems.
 PICARD / (to Troi) You mentioned a hospitalization --
 TROI / (nodding) For stress. Repeatedly, throughout his life.
 BEVERLY / I always wonder... what holds one person together through that kind of struggle, while another goes under?
 PICARD / Yes, well, he's evidently done more than "hold together". He's the indispensable man -- the Federation's finest specialist in communication with unknown life-forms.
 BEVERLY / It looks like the more unusual a life form is, the better he likes it. His personnel file shows that he's gravitated toward assignments that isolate him from other humanoids.
 WESLEY / Commander Data, I'm picking up an unusual echo from my navigational sensors.
 WORF / There is something there, sir, tracking us -- matching our speed and heading. Something which doesn't fully register on our instruments.
 DATA / Since there is no known natural phenomenon capable of travel at warp velocities, there are but two possibilities: either it is a sensor malfunction, or it is another ship, following us covertly.
 WORF / It is not a sensor malfunction.
 DATA / Agreed.
 WESLEY / A Romulan ship? With their cloaking device, we shouldn't pick them up at all.
 GEORDI / Unless they're pulling so much power for something else that they can't fully cloak.
 WESLEY / Like what?
 GEORDI / (shrugging) Ask the Romulans... if it is the Romulans.
 DATA / Lieutenant, continue monitoring the precise position of the echo -- at any sudden change in its behavior, initiate Yellow Alert.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 TROI / I thought you might be lonely. No one sees you, except Data.
 TROI / (interrupting, annoyed) You want them to dislike you. Why?
 TROI / I remember.
 TROI / And you're still looking.
 TROI / What happened there?
 TROI / No. What happened to you?
 TROI / So after that, you ran away? The last I heard, you were the only Federation delegate assigned to Chandra Five.
 TROI / Unlike humanoids?
 TROI / I believe your impression of Data is probably unique.
 TROI / But you accepted this mission. You could have stayed on Chandra Five. You willingly came aboard a ship of over a thousand people --
 TROI / (concerned) How can you know that? Tam?
 TROI / You're in contact with it. With Tin Man. Aren't you?
 TROI / But we're still light-years away. That must be impossible -- even for you.
 PICARD / Status, Number One?
 RIKER / We've reached the outer regions of the Beta Stromgren system, sir. On course for orbital intercept of Tin Man, e.t.a. eighteen minutes.
 PICARD / Grand.
 RIKER / Not altogether. Astrophysics reports that the star's rate of collapse is increasing -- it could go supernova within the next few days.
 DATA / Captain, we are receiving relayed sensor data, from the Vega Probe -- including visuals.
 PICARD / On screen, Mister Data.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 PICARD / Remarkable. Computer -- locate Tam Elbrun.
 PICARD / Of course.
 WORF / Commander...
 RIKER / Problem, Worf?
 WORF / Sir, I am reading a wave front of ionized particles preceding the object which is tracking us.
 RIKER / (nodding) Go to Yellow Alert.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / Romulan warbird, closing. (pause) They're arming main distruptors, Captain.
 PICARD / Go to Red Alert -- shields at maximum.
 RIKER / Worf, arm photon torpedoes and stand by.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (to Data) I thought you said the Enterprise was faster than this Romulan --
 DATA / In fact, we are, Commander. However --
 PICARD / Evasive, Mister Worf. Data, open hailing frequencies --
 WORF / The Romulan has passed us, sir, and recloaked.
 PICARD / Damage report.
 WORF / No casualties reported. Seventy percent loss to main shields, sir.
 PICARD / Incidental?
 DATA / Captain, it would appear that the Romulan's intent is to contact Tin Man first, at any cost. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (pause) According to my sensor readings, the warbird exceeded maximum engine output by nearly thirty percent... They appear to have suffered irreparable damage to their warp coils.
 RIKER / So -- they kept up with us by sacrificing their ability to return to Romulan space.
 PICARD / A one-way trip.
 PICARD / You read all this, telepathically --
 PICARD / Very well, then. Mister Crusher all stop.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Commander La Forge.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Geordi -- how long to restore shields?
 GEORDI / Working on it. Computer, reconfigure structural integrity power to feed inner deflector grid.
 GEORDI / To hell with the limits. Override. Authorization La Forge theta two-nine-nine-seven.
 GEORDI / (yells to supernumerary in next room) Russell! Watch the lateral grid balance. (looks at panel) Nope, too much. We gotta do it manually. (keys insignia) La Forge to bridge.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / Captain, I'm trying to feed the inner grid by stealing some power from the structural integrity field. You should have partial shielding in thirty minutes.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / You have ten.
 PICARD / Picard out. (to the group in general) The Romulans wish the honor of the first contact, let them have it.
 PICARD / I think the chances of that are remote. And, Mister Elbrun, if you'll be still you may learn --
 PICARD / That being first, at any cost, is not always the point. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (pause) Data, while we await repairs, I want Life Sciences and Engineering to continue collecting information on the alien. Query the Vega Nine probe, and the long-range sensors.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Yes. I have configured these instruments to display information with greater speed and efficiency than stations used by the others.
 DATA / Spartan?
 DATA / (still working) I have tried it, from time to time. But you are correct. I do not require rest.
 DATA / The creature's anatomy appears most peculiar.
 DATA / It is indeed laid out as a vessel, with what appear to be corridors and chambers. An internal environment suitable for carbon based life forms is being maintained. Yet there is no evidence of a crew aboard. (thoughtful) Tin Man is a living being yet it was bred or adapted itself to serve a purpose. I find that very interesting.
 DATA / I do not believe I am qualified to express an opinion.
 DATA / You said in the Transporter Room that you could not read my mind.
 DATA / (quietly) Perhaps there is nothing to read. Nothing other than mechanism and algorithmic response --
 DATA / Captain, the Romulan ship is hailing the alien using their equivalent of linguacode.
 RIKER / Response?
 DATA / None so far, Commander.
 RIKER / But you're so sure it'll "talk" to you.
 WORF / (interrupting) Captain, the Romulans are arming all disruptors.
 PICARD / Yellow Alert. Prepare for evasive action at the first change in the Romulans' course.
 RIKER / With our shields in their present condition, we can't risk --
 PICARD / What do you mean? They intend to destroy it?
 PICARD / (to Wesley) Increase speed to intercept the Romulans.
 WESLEY / Their lead is too great.
 PICARD / Worf, hail them. I cannot allow --
 PICARD / Worf! Damage report!
 WORF / Not yet available, Captain. We have partial failure of the main computer.
 PICARD / You did this. You woke your Tin Man.
 Geordi SUPERVISING several Engineering technicians as RIKER LOOKS ON. A technician hands Geordi a PADD, / which he READS with consternation.
 GEORDI / We've got impulse power, but I've got to take the warp engines off line while we recalibrate the intermix regulators.
 RIKER / How long?
 GEORDI / For just the warp drive, or for everything?
 RIKER / All of it.
 GEORDI / We're looking at twenty hours work, double shifts.
 RIKER / Geordi, we don't know that we have twenty hours. The star could explode at any time --
 GEORDI / I know. Okay, first we need to get the main computer working right --
 RIKER / No -- fix the shields first.
 GEORDI / Commander, whatever Tin Man hit us with, it fried circuits I thought were unfryable.
 RIKER / It's not Tin Man I'm worried about. It's more Romulans showing up.
 GEORDI / Right. First priority, get the shields up. Only, let's not have any more surprises till I'm done.
 RIKER / (bitterly) Don't ask me about surprises. Ask Tam Elbrun.
 BEVERLY / Brain activity suggests that you're coming out of a sort of fugue, or seizure... blood pressure and glucose indicative of general systemic stress --
 BEVERLY / (very dry) No doubt about it.
 PICARD / Good. I want to know exactly what you did. I want to know how closely you are in communication with the alien, and what you've learned about it. Now.
 PICARD / Where did it come from? How many...
 PICARD / Once?
 PICARD / Perhaps we can help it in some way. Can you ask it to return with us to Federation space? Or at least to remove itself from the vicinity of Beta Stromgren, before the star explodes?
 BEVERLY / Why?
 TROI / Stop this! Tam -- Tam, you're losing yourself in this -- this merging.
 PICARD / No. Absolutely out of the question.
 PICARD / No. I don't believe that I do.
 PICARD / (continuing) Tam -- when you reached out to the alien, to warn it -- did you give any thought to this vessel? To the danger, however inadvertent, the creature might pose to our crew? Or did you simply react out of instinct?
 TROI / Captain --
 GEORDI / Russell -- reactivate the sensor assemblies.
 GEORDI / Okay, let's do a program reload on the port array only.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Good. Computer, run level two diagnostic.
 GEORDI / Damn.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to La Forge. How's it coming?
 GEORDI / Not great... I think all the control processors are shot. Maybe if I swap the chips from the secondary array, I can give you a minimum EM scan.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Do it.
 GEORDI / Russell -- try restarting sensor element thirty-two only.
 GEORDI / Well, the good news is that we have partial long range sensors. (he taps his communicator) La Forge to bridge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker here.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I'm picking up another echo on the long-range sensor display here. You getting that on your panel?
 RIKER / Worf?
 WORF / One moment, Commander.
 WORF / Confirmed. Sir, the other Romulan ship... on an intercept course.
 RIKER / (very discouraged) Geordi, are we gonna have shields anytime soon?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I'm doing the best I can... But shields won't help if that star explodes.
 PICARD / Data, you and Tam Elbrun seem to have developed an affinity. Troi, you've known him for years. How far can he be trusted?
 TROI / Captain, the issue isn't one of trust in Tam's intentions, but in his judgment. I would trust him to do what he believes is right --
 PICARD / Yes, of course. But his judgment...
 TROI / ... Is precarious. The stress of exposure to so many minds on the ship has been bad enough. Now he's strongly drawn to this creature. I'm afraid for him.
 PICARD / Afraid of what?
 TROI / I sense that the alien is somehow calling him. If we allow him to do as he insists -- to beam over -- I'm afraid that we'll lose him to it. (pause) That he will lose himself.
 DATA / Captain, I agree that Tam's motives are trustworthy. I do not believe it is possible that he might act against us, or cause Tin Man to act against us out of malice.
 TROI / If Tam breaks down over there, we'll be no closer to accomplishing our mission, Captain. It would be a grave mistake.
 PICARD / Thank you both.
 WORF / Captain, the Romulan has uncloaked.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / I am puzzled, sir. We have come this far. But you may not allow Tam to fulfill his mission.
 PICARD / Data -- Elbrun warned Tin Man, and the first thing it did was to destroy a space vessel.
 DATA / I think I understand, sir. (pause) If you feel that the risk is too great to send Tam Elbrun, alone, then send me with him.
 PICARD / Counselor Troi understands him better.
 DATA / (acknowledging) But I distress him less. (a beat) It is humanity he is fleeing. I can serve as an intermediary... a bridge back, and a reminder of his obligations... both to us and to Tin Man.
 PICARD / Status Number One?
 RIKER / Shields at forty percent, Captain. We can maneuver on impulse.
 WORF / Phasers available on manual, sir. computer target lock not functioning.
 PICARD / Well, let's hope they're in a mood to talk. Open hailing frequencies.
 PICARD / Romulan vessel -- this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
 PICARD / We are not familiar with the terms of your claim on this sector, Commander. We are here engaged in scientific research. Do you wish to participate --
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, Supplemental. Light-years beyond the edges of explored space, and virtually disabled, our survival may now depend upon Tam Elbrun's telepathic rapport with an alien intelligence.
 PICARD / Picard to Tam Elbrun.
 PICARD / Report to Transporter Room Six immediately.
 TROI / Captain, I don't --
 PICARD / (to Tam) Commander Data will meet you there.
 PICARD / Counselor, we no longer have a choice.
 DATA / (concerned) Tam?
 DATA / Data to Enterprise. Come in Enterprise.
 DATA / If it is harming you, we must return.
 DATA / (continuing) Enterprise, respond.
 DATA / (continuing) I cannot contact the ship.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Chief.
 WORF / Confirmed. The alien has thrown up a shield -- it's blocking all our sensors.
 WORF / The Romulans' weapons systems are now at full power.
 PICARD / Red Alert... Mister Worf... arm photon torpedos.
 DATA / There is a large chamber twenty meters ahead.
 DATA / Intriguing.
 DATA / (recalling their earlier talk) And is that the purpose of existence? To care for someone?
 DATA / I must remind you that our objective is to bring Tin Man out of danger and report our findings to Starfleet.
 PICARD / Commander -- we are prepared to defend the life of the alien. (to Worf) Shields up.
 WORF / (urgently) Power levels aboard the alien are increasing, sir.
 WESLEY / (stepping on Worf's line in his urgency) Captain, the diameter of the star has decreased by one hundred thousand kilometers.
 PICARD / (to Riker) It's beginning.
 DATA / (forcefully) But our mission...
 RIKER / The star is gonna go any minute, sir.
 PICARD / The Romulans know that as well as we do.
 WORF / Power levels aboard Tin Man increasing beyond our sensor range.
 PICARD / Conn -- report.
 WESLEY / Dead stop, Captain. Sir-- (pause as he double-checks readings) We've been thrown clear of Beta Stromgren. Distance -- three point eight billion kilometers.
 WORF / There is no sign of Tin Man or the Romulans, sir. (checks his panel) Captain -- on screen!
 PICARD / Data.
 DATA / Sir?
 PICARD / Data -- what happened, over there?
 DATA / Difficult to explain, Captain.
 TROI / Tam?
 DATA / I believe he has found what he was looking for, Counselor.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. With all main systems at least temporarily restored, we are proceeding to Starbase one fifty-two for inspection and additional repairs.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) We have had no further encounter with the Romulans. As for the whereabouts of Tin Man, and Tam Elbrun -- we can only speculate.
 TROI / You sent for me?
 DATA / (turning to face her) Tam's final request was for me to explain his decision to the crew. But I believe his hope was that you would understand.
 TROI / What did happen, Data?
 DATA / I witnessed something remarkable. (considers a moment) Individually they were both so...
 TROI / Wounded? Incomplete?
 DATA / Yes. But no longer. Through their joining they have been healed. Grief was transmuted to joy. Loneliness to belonging.
 TROI / Data, you do understand...
 DATA / Yes, Counselor, when Tin Man returned me to the Enterprise I realized that this was where I belong.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Barclay, report to Cargo Bay Five now.
 GEORDI / I just don't know what to do with him. He's always late, never gives his best effort, always slides by... I can't deal with it anymore. How does a guy like him ever make it through the Academy...
 RIKER / (agrees) I think it's time we talked to the captain about Broccoli. (off Geordi's look) That's what Wesley calls him. Keep it to yourself.
 GEORDI / It fits.
 GEORDI / You better destroy it. Those samples will be tainted.
 GEORDI / Is it a problem for you to report to duty on time, Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / (tired of excuses) I don't want to hear it... we're having intermittent problems with the anti-grav unit, see what you can do...
 RIKER / Mister Barclay, I'm tired of seeing your name on report. (a beat) I don't know what you got away with on your last posting, but this is the Enterprise. We set a different standard here. Understood?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43807.4. We are taking on a load of special tissue samples donated by the Mikulaks for shipment to Nahmi Four. The samples could prove vital to the containment of an outbreak of Correllium Fever on that world.
 GEORDI / (to com) La Forge to Engineering... I'll need more people in Cargo Bay Five... anyone you can spare. Out.
 GEORDI / We could use a hand, Mister Barclay...
 PICARD / I'm not accustomed to seeing an unsatisfactory rating for one of my crew.
 RIKER / I guess the issue is whether Mister Barclay is Enterprise material.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) I assume from your request for his transfer that you don't think he is, Commander...
 GEORDI / I hate to say it... I always thought I could work with anyone... but I just can't stand the guy. Broccoli makes me nervous... he makes everyone nervous...
 PICARD / Broccoli?
 RIKER / Young Mister Crusher started it. I'm afraid it's caught on.
 PICARD / Let's get it uncaught, shall we?
 PICARD / By all indications, Barclay has served honorably in Starfleet for many years. His rating aboard the Zhukov was satisfactory... I recall Captain Gleason speaking quite highly of him before his transfer...
 RIKER / In retrospect, I wonder if Captain Gleason wasn't buttering our bread a little... (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / He knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer.
 RIKER / I've reviewed Barclay's psychological profile. He's always had seclusive tendencies... it was noted at the Academy more than once...
 PICARD / And yet he chose this way of life; he's made the same commitment to Starfleet that we all have... (beat) It's easy to transfer our problem to someone else. Too easy.
 GEORDI / Captain, it's not like I haven't tried...
 PICARD / Try harder.
 PICARD / He's on your team. Manage him. Pull him in. Find ways to help him make a positive contribution. Get to know the man. Make him your best friend.
 GEORDI / With all respect, sir... my best friend? I can barely tolerate being in the same room with the man...
 PICARD / I suggest you put your personal discomfort with him aside, Commander. Dismissed.
 GEORDI / (muttering, to himself) My best friend.
 GEORDI / Hey, Reg...
 GEORDI / Uh, how's it going?
 GEORDI / (smile, "warm") That's okay. No rush. Take your time.
 GEORDI / Smart plan... well, I'd say we're in good hands here...
 GEORDI / ...whenever.
 GEORDI / Fine. And say, Reg, how about sitting in on the mission briefing with my senior officers in the morning...
 GEORDI / I'd just like your input...
 GEORDI / No... no... just be there. Eight hundred hours.
 GEORDI / Good.
 GEORDI / Morning. Start your brains, and let's do it.
 GEORDI / (points to injectors on schematic) Okay, this trip to Nahmi Four is pretty routine. We'll have plenty of time to realign the magnetic capacitors in both the matter and anti-matter injectors. (light hearted groans) Duffy, Costa, that'll be your assignment.
 GEORDI / Good idea. (moving on) Ensign Crusher is putting in some hours with us this week as part of his training duties... he'll be assigned to assist you, Mister Myers. Be sure and teach him the difference between impulse and warp drive. (chuckles all around) Lieutenant Barclay is working on the mystery of the anti-grav failure we had yesterday... your preliminary report had a couple of interesting theories, Reg...
 GEORDI / Why don't you summarize your findings so far, Reg...
 WESLEY / (certain) A coil surge wouldn't have resulted in a field dissipation.
 GEORDI / (trying to rescue the the situation) But we shouldn't ignore the possibility, Wes...
 WESLEY / You ought to take a look at the flow capacitor. That could have forced a chain collapse of the antigrav field.
 GEORDI / Good. Okay, then... let's go over the realignment procedure...
 WESLEY / But I thought that's the point of the briefing... to discuss different approaches...
 GEORDI / I'm not saying you did anything wrong, Wes... it's just that Barclay's... well, my new project.
 GEORDI / (frowns, hates the job) I just gotta draw him out more...
 WESLEY / And I shut him down. (with pity) Poor Broccoli.
 DATA / Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant Barclay being referred to clandestinely as a vegetable?
 WESLEY / It's a joke, Data... you know, a nickname.
 DATA / Nicknames generally denote fondness, a diminutive shared between friends. This does not sound friendly.
 GEORDI / Data's absolutely right. The nickname stops here and now. Captain's orders.
 WESLEY / What happened to your glass?
 DATA / Nucleo-synthesis. The structure of the glass has been altered at the atomic level.
 GEORDI / A problem with the replicator?
 DATA / Unlikely. A problem with the replicator would have affected the contents as well as the glass. But the liquid in the glass was a perfect replication of a dark ale of Earth origin which I believe is what Lieutenant Duffy ordered.
 GEORDI / I can't detect any residual radiation or unusual chemical compounds that would have caused this.
 DATA / The most probable explanation is that the glass came into contact with an unshielded power source.
 GEORDI / (slightly dismayed) That means a complete diagnostic check of the Enterprise power systems. All four thousand of them.
 GEORDI / Have I got the man for this job... (calling) Hey, Reg...
 GEORDI / Busy?
 GEORDI / (handing him the cup) Got another mystery for you... somehow the molecular structure of this cup from Ten-Forward has been altered...
 GEORDI / Mister Barclay is the Sherlock Holmes of the technical support crew...
 DATA / A fascinating vocation, Mister Barclay. I am a student of Sherlock Holmes mysteries and I would enjoy discussing some of your cases at your leisure.
 GEORDI / (to Barclay, indicating glass) Uh, Reg, we're gonna have to run through the power systems, to see if there's some kind of leak that caused this.
 GEORDI / You were?
 DATA / Then it is possible these two very disparate incidents could be related.
 GEORDI / I wouldn't bother you with something this minor, Commander... but it may be a symptom of a more serious problem...
 RIKER / You think we'll need to put in to a starbase?
 GEORDI / We'll have a better idea after Mister Barclay runs a check of the power systems...
 DATA / It was Lieutenant Barclay who first suggested the link between the two incidents, sir.
 PICARD / Will your investigation affect our available power during the mission, Lieutenant?
 PICARD / Good. I look forward to your report, Mister Broccoli.
 PICARD / Barclay.
 DATA / Metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors, sir... a reversal of vowel and consonant, "bark" to "broc"...
 GEORDI / Figures.
 GEORDI / (frowns) I don't know. I'm just trying to figure the man out, that's all. You ever talk to him?
 GEORDI / Does he have any friends?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) What do you do with a guy like that?
 GEORDI / Yeah, well, I'm not so lucky. I can't let him be. He's my problem.
 GEORDI / How do you know that?
 GEORDI / Well, then maybe he's in the wrong line of work.
 GEORDI / That's not it, Guinan... he just doesn't fit in here...
 GEORDI / What?
 GEORDI / Did you?
 GEORDI / Maybe I didn't make myself clear... Barclay, he's always late... he's nervous... nobody wants to be around him...
 GEORDI / Guinan, that's not the point...
 GEORDI / (beat, exasperated) I'll take another one of these.
 GEORDI / (sighs, keys insignia) Computer, where is Lieutenant Barclay?
 GEORDI / Reg... ?
 GEORDI / Beverly?
 GEORDI / (to himself) Wesley... ?
 GEORDI / Ah, well, I guess I want... Master Barclay.
 GEORDI / Now, wait a minute...
 GEORDI / Hey, Barclay... I've spent a few hours in the Holodeck myself, you know.
 GEORDI / Far as I'm concerned... what you do in the Holodeck is your own business... as long as it doesn't affect your work.
 GEORDI / (no) I'm not sure everyone would appreciate your... imagination... like I do.
 GEORDI / (curious) It is kind of unusual... recreating people you already know...
 GEORDI / Let me guess...
 GEORDI / (warm, smiles) I don't know... sounds like maybe there's a side to this that's kind of therapeutic... we ought to tell Counselor Troi about it.
 GEORDI / I'd like to help if I can.
 GEORDI / Sometimes, neither do I.
 GEORDI / You're just shy, Barclay.
 GEORDI / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / On my way, Chief.
 GEORDI / I really do want you to talk to Counselor Troi, Reg.
 GEORDI / I mean it. As your friend and as your commanding officer.
 GEORDI / Seems normal enough...
 GEORDI / I'm glad I don't have anywhere to go. FADE OUT.                         END OF ACT TWO                          
 GEORDI (V.O.) / Chief engineer's log, Stardate 43808.2. A systems analysis of Transporter Room Three has yielded no suggestion of a cause for the latest malfunction aboard the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Is this part of the same pattern?
 GEORDI / We don't know, Captain. And we don't know why only Transporter Room Three is affected... None of the other Transporter Rooms are malfunctioning...
 RIKER / Yet.
 PICARD / (to Riker) We have twenty-two hours before we reach Nahmi Four. We'll need the transporters operational by then. I want a level one diagnostic across the board. (TECH)
 RIKER / (acknowledges, to Geordi) Advise Mister Barclay to meet us on the bridge immediately...
 GEORDI / Ah, could we push that back, just to fourteen hundred hours, Commander... I've got him doing something...
 RIKER / (nods) Fourteen hundred hours. (as they exit) Mister O'Brien, no maintenance on the Transporters until further notice.
 TROI / I can tell this is difficult for you.
 TROI / Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
 TROI / Have you ever been with a counselor before?
 TROI / (smiles) Which one?
 TROI / Most people find a counselor intimidating at first. It's okay if you feel that way toward me.
 TROI / Good. Close your eyes... Lean back.
 TROI / (standing) I just want to help you relax.
 TROI / Put your feet up... it's okay. And close your eyes...
 TROI / Just listen to the sound of my voice... (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / Take a slow deep breath through your nose... and let it out through your mouth just as slowly... good... there, that's better, isn't it...
 TROI / But...
 TROI / I had a very strange visit from one of your officers today.
 GEORDI / Barclay. Yes, I can imagine. Were you able to do anything for him?
 TROI / To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what happened...
 RIKER / (entering from Picard's Ready Room) Where is Mister Barclay... it's past fourteen hundred hours...
 GEORDI / (touches combadge) Lieutenant Barclay to the bridge. (beat of silence) Lieutenant Barclay report.
 RIKER / Computer. Locate Lieutenant Barclay.
 GEORDI / I'll get him...
 RIKER / No, I'll handle this. I've had it with him.
 GEORDI / Counselor, you better come along...
 GEORDI / I think you should know that Barclay's been running some... unique programs.
 RIKER / I don't care what he's been running. My patience just ran out.
 GEORDI / Like I said Commander, Barclay's been running some... unusual programs.
 RIKER / This is a violation of protocol. Crewmembers should not be simulated in the Holodeck...
 GEORDI / Ah, Commander... I don't think there's any regulation...
 RIKER / Then there should be... computer, discontinue program and erase...
 TROI / (interrupting) Computer, belay that order!
 RIKER / Counselor...
 TROI / If Barclay is having a difficult time facing reality, to suddenly destroy his only means of escape would be brutal and could do considerable damage.
 RIKER / Stop it. Put that down.
 RIKER / (impatient) I don't have a sword.
 RIKER / I don't expect to fight.
 RIKER / (furious) Where is he? Where is Barclay?
 RIKER / ... in all the Holodeck.
 RIKER / (to Troi) You think this is funny?
 TROI / You are very tall. It could be very threatening to some people.
 RIKER / Barclay'll find out what it means to be threatened. Computer, discontinue image of Riker.
 GEORDI / Just tell us where to find Barclay.
 RIKER / (to Troi) You're gonna make us search through this to find him?
 TROI / It could provide us with valuable information about what's troubling him.
 TROI / There's nothing wrong with a healthy fantasy life, as long as it doesn't take over.
 RIKER / You call this healthy?
 TROI / You're taking it so seriously. This is not without its element of humor...
 GEORDI / Oh my God...
 TROI / Computer, discontinue --
 RIKER / (delighted) Belay that order, computer! (to Troi) We want to get more insight into what's troubling the poor man. Remember? (to Geordi) Quite a healthy fantasy life, wouldn't you agree?
 PICARD / Report...
 WORF / Sir, our velocity increased to warp seven point two five.
 DATA / Compensating, sir.
 WORF / (reading console) Confirmed. Velocity now warp seven.
 PICARD / Maintain that. What the hell happened?
 DATA / (still working) The matter_anti-matter injectors locked for a split second, Captain. I am not certain why. They seem to be working properly now.
 PICARD / (pressing insignia) Picard to La Forge.
 GEORDI / (to com) Go ahead, Captain.
 PICARD / Any explanation for the injector problem?
 GEORDI / I'm not in Engineering, sir. I'm in Holodeck Two.
 PICARD / Another malfunction?
 GEORDI / Not exactly, sir. I'll return to Engineering immediately.
 PICARD / Yes, I would say you should, Commander. Your Holodeck activities can wait until later. And Commander...
 GEORDI / Yessir?
 PICARD / It would be wise to consult Lieutenant Barclay on this latest incident.
 GEORDI / I'd like to, very much, sir. La Forge out. END INTERCUT:
 GEORDI / (to the Goddess) We need to find Barclay. Now.
 TROI / Muzzle it.
 TROI / We have a lot to talk about.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Sir, Barclay and I better get to Engineering.
 RIKER / (acknowledges) Dismissed.
 GEORDI / Reg... you had a chance to get some help from the real Counselor Troi... but instead you went back in there...
 GEORDI / You're gonna be able to write the book on holodiction. (they exchange a look) Look, I know how easy it is to get caught up in it. I... fell in love in there once.
 GEORDI / (nods) But I knew when it was time to turn it off and say goodbye... Wasn't easy. But I did it.
 GEORDI / I need you out here, Reg... right now, more than ever.
 GEORDI / The injectors aren't responding to the diagnostic commands.
 GEORDI / (hits combadge) La Forge to bridge.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Commander.
 GEORDI / Recommend we go to impulse power sir.
 PICARD / Take us out of warp.
 DATA / Controls are not responding, Captain.
 GEORDI / Override.
 DATA / Speed increasing, Captain. Warp seven point six... seven point six five... seven point seven...
 GEORDI / We can't shut it down, Captain. The anti-matter flow is increasing. She's accelerating out of control.
 WORF / Approaching warp nine sir...
 PICARD / Red Alert.
 RIKER / Data, estimated time to structural failure.
 DATA / (working panels) At this rate of acceleration, fifteen minutes, forty seconds, Commander...
 RIKER / Geordi, did you copy?
 GEORDI / Aye, Commander...
 RIKER / Recommendations.
 GEORDI / (under great pressure) I'll let you know as soon as we have some. La Forge out. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (to his men) Okay, this ship will start tearing itself apart in fifteen minutes... I want every idea on the table... I don't care how outrageous...
 GEORDI / No, I tried that already... the magnetic fields won't reset.
 WESLEY / Could the fuel inlet servos be caught in cycle?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) If they were, the swirl dampers would be frozen too... and they aren't...
 GEORDI / There's nothing wrong with the computer control protocols or the power transfer systems. As far as we can determine, the injectors are just physically jammed...
 WESLEY / And a twisted glass...
 GEORDI / What's the connection?
 WORF / Exceeding warp nine point four.
 PICARD / Begin evacuation of secondary hull. Prepare for emergency saucer separation.
 WORF / (reading console) Standing by to release docking clamps.
 RIKER / Re-route systems to primary hull power sources.
 DATA / Captain, the plasma flow to the nacelles is uneven due to the injector lock. An emergency saucer separation could rupture the warp field.
 DATA / Twelve minutes to structural failure.
 GEORDI / None of the systems involved interact directly with each other... I don't see anything in common...
 WESLEY / The computer sensors would've picked up anything dangerous.
 GEORDI / It was your glass, Duffy... and both of you were in the cargo bay when the anti-grav failed...
 WESLEY / The transporter malfunction. That's a connection too.
 GEORDI / Computer, list all physical substances that wouldn't normally be picked up by internal scans.
 GEORDI / (sarcastically) Great. How many of those can exist in an oxygen atmosphere?
 GEORDI / (irritated) And could alter molecular structure when it comes in contact with... (a beat) ... with glass.
 GEORDI / (touches pool table button) On screen at this station.
 GEORDI / Right.
 WESLEY / Selgninaem and Lucrovexitrin are extremely toxic.
 GEORDI / (acknowledges, touches panel again) We'd all be dead by now. That leaves Saltzgadum and Invidium. Neither of which has been used for decades.
 WESLEY / Could either one be causing all these malfunctions?
 GEORDI / (beat) Wasn't Invidium used in... medical containment fields?
 WESLEY / Not for over a century.
 GEORDI / (hits combadge) La Forge to bridge. We have a working theory, Captain...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / There's a chance we picked up some Invidium from a broken canister in the cargo bay... and have been spreading it around the ship...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Working theories are fine, Geordi. But we need a working solution in about five minutes...
 GEORDI / Understood, Commander. We're on our way to Cargo Bay Five for confirmation.
 GEORDI / Nothing from the tricorder...
 GEORDI / Duffy and O'Brien picked up the broken canister and became contaminated..
 GEORDI / La Forge to bridge. Invidium is confirmed.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / (continuing) Recommend we flood the injector pathway conduit with liquid nitrogen. That should neutralize it.
 PICARD / The question is, will the injectors come back on-line?
 GEORDI / The injectors have sustained considerable damage, sir. I can't guarantee we'll be able to regain control...
 RIKER / We don't have much choice, do we?
 GEORDI / Nossir.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 WESLEY / Routing... ready for engine core injection.
 DATA / (working console) Injector conduit temperature minus one hundred degrees Celsius.
 PICARD / Transfer injector control to manual.
 DATA / Ready... temperature now minus one hundred ninety degrees... minus two hundred degrees, sir.
 RIKER / Injector status?
 DATA / Matter injector... is on-line. Anti-matter injector... still locked.
 PICARD / Cycle power through ventral relay.
 DATA / (works console) Anti-matter injector... on-line. Reducing flow capacity. Commencing warp engine shut-down.
 PICARD / Stand down from Red Alert.
 RIKER / (to com) Nice work, Geordi.
 GEORDI / Mister Barclay and I thank you, sir.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (beat) Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / The ship is seriously contaminated with Invidium, sir. Recommend we set course for Starbase one-two-one for a complete systems and bio-decontamination.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Understood.
 GEORDI / Glad you were with us out here in the real world today, Mister Barclay.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43872.2. In order to neutralize a sudden contamination of the water supply at the Federation colony on Beta Agni Two, we are procuring one hundred and eight kilos of hytritium from the Zibalian trader, Kivas Fajo.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Because pure hytritium is too unstable for our transporters, Lieutenant Commander Data has been shuttling the material to the Enterprise.
 DATA / (touching his communicator) Data to Enterprise.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Go ahead, Mister Data.
 DATA / This will be the last trip... the remaining cases of hytritium are now being loaded.
 GEORDI is monitoring the situation from the Engineering / Station. PICARD, RIKER, WORF, and WESLEY are at their stations.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. Mister Worf, advise Beta Agni Two that our departure is imminent.
 WORF / Aye, Captain.
 RIKER / (to Picard) At warp six, we should be there in just over sixteen hours.
 DATA / (to comm) Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. (protocol) Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare for docking, level one precautions for incoming material remain in effect.
 GEORDI / Shuttle twelve containment field reads nominal... Now leaving the Jovis.
 PICARD / On viewer.
 GEORDI / (reading his console) Containment field stable... gravitational fluctuations within acceptable parameters... flight pattern...
 RIKER / Why didn't the containment field hold?
 GEORDI / (checking readings) Unknown, Commander.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Hail the Jovis -- I want to speak with Kivas Fajo.
 WORF / Sir, Mister Fajo is hailing us.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / It is unclear at this time; we're running a full analysis.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / Mister Fajo, I would like to analyze your sensor readings of the explosion.
 PICARD / Perhaps, but I want to leave no avenue unexplored.
 WORF / Link established... Receiving.
 PICARD / (to Riker) How much hytritium did we manage to bring on board?
 RIKER / Eighty-one kilos.
 GEORDI / That might be barely enough to complete our mission, Captain... but it's not leaving us any margin for error.
 PICARD / (to Fajo) I realize we have acquired your complete supply of hytritium. Do you know where we could obtain more?
 RIKER / (to Picard) Three weeks away.
 RIKER / I guess we're fortunate you had any at all, sir.
 WORF / (to Picard) Transfer of information is complete, Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Fajo, thank you for your help.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, lay in a course for Beta Agni Two, warp six.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (to Picard) The Grissom is currently near the Sigma Erani system... I'll have them stand by in case we need more hytritium.
 PICARD / Very good, Number One.
 WESLEY / Course laid in, sir.
 PICARD / Engage.
 DATA / (ad lib) Gibberish... (self-adjusting) ...Starfleet... gibberish... Enterprise.
 DATA / Why have I been brought here?
 DATA / (patiently tries again) I have been delivered here against my wishes. I would like to know the reason.
 DATA / Am I to infer that you intend to keep me captive?
 DATA / It is my name.
 DATA / I wish to leave.
 DATA / This is unacceptable. I have no desire to remain here... and even if I did, my Starfleet duties would not permit it.
 DATA / Then I am forced to attempt escape.
 DATA / Then you will have to open it for me.
 DATA / I fail to understand the value you place upon my presence.
 DATA / (reacts) But I thought they were extinct...
 DATA / I am not. Most intelligent lifeforms find involuntary confinement offensive and inequitable. Moreover, you have violated Federation law --
 DATA / I must emphasize, Mister Fajo, that I consider this captivity a hostile act on your part.
 WESLEY / I can't believe he's gone.
 GEORDI / I always thought he'd outlive us -- by centuries.
 WESLEY / He'd been working on this for months... never felt it was quite finished...
 GEORDI / You know what a critic Data was... especially about his own work.
 WESLEY / It was a gift from the captain.
 GEORDI / Then he should have it back.
 WESLEY / Those should go to Commander Riker.
 GEORDI / Data always fell for Riker's bluffs...
 WESLEY / These are some of Starfleet's highest honors.
 GEORDI / Not bad for a walking pile of circuitry and memory cells.
 GEORDI / I keep going over and over the accident in my mind. Trying to figure out what went wrong. I can see him in the shuttle... almost like I'm sitting next to him... going through the departure sequence... What the hell happened? Why didn't I see it coming? Did I miss something...
 DATA / I have no reason to accede to Mister Fajo's wishes.
 DATA / He is deluding himself if he believes he can keep me here. The Enterprise is certain to find me --
 DATA / They will scan the debris and discover I was not aboard...
 DATA / Plainly Mister Fajo has no moral difficulties with my imprisonment here.
 DATA / Do you?
 DATA / Yes. (beat) Are you my enemy?
 DATA / Why?
 DATA / Do you object to the question?
 DATA / It appears he has us both.
 GEORDI / Computer, did the containment power supply or the backups fail prior to the explosion?
 GEORDI / Analyze telemetry from gravity generator, impulse vents, fuel cells, inertial dampers, and related subsystems.
 GEORDI / What about external factors? Local stellar phenomena?
 GEORDI / Was the shuttle close enough to the Enterprise to have been affected by our warp fields?
 GEORDI / Return file to start... Let's go through it all again...
 GEORDI / The reason I can't find anything is there's nothing there to find. I've run the analysis a dozen times over... there's no indication of a malfunction...
 RIKER / No possible explanation at all... ?
 GEORDI / Well, yeah, there's one, but I don't believe it. Pilot error.
 PICARD / (a beat, sighs) I know it's hard to accept, but even the best...
 GEORDI / Captain, it's not hard to accept... with Data, it's almost impossible. I can't even begin to calculate the odds. If Data were here, we could ask him...
 PICARD / What are you suggesting, Commander?
 GEORDI / I don't really know, sir. It just doesn't make sense. I like things to make sense... that's all.
 RIKER / Geordi, if you got a little rest, came at it with a fresh mind...
 GEORDI / A little rest isn't going to change the computer analysis, Commander.
 PICARD / (stands) I'm sure you've done a complete investigation. If you wish to continue it, you have my support of course. But we'll be reaching the Beta Agni system shortly. I expect you to be rested.
 GEORDI / I understand, Captain.
 PICARD / Dismissed.
 PICARD / Geordi... I understand how much we want... even need to explain an accident like this. Sometimes there just aren't any explanations.
 RIKER / For an android without feelings... he sure managed to evoke them in others.
 PICARD / We must select an officer to replace Data at Ops. Recommendations?
 RIKER / My first choice would be Lieutenant Worf, sir.
 PICARD / Mine as well. Make it so.
 PICARD / (One line of Shakespeare that provides the perfect epitaph to Data.)
 DATA / I am a Starfleet officer.
 DATA / Even if I chose to do so, it is doubtful whether my programming could be sufficiently altered to accede to your wishes.
 DATA / I have been designed with a fundamental respect for life in all its forms... and a strong inhibition against causing harm to living beings.
 DATA / It was ultimately my own decision. My skills seemed appropriate...
 DATA / No, but I am programmed with the ability to use deadly force in a cause of defense.
 DATA / I would not participate in murder. Perhaps you misunderstand...
 DATA / You are a fine debater, sir. It is a shame you have used your verbal gifts for mere hucksterism and the advancement of your own greed.
 DATA / I must decline.
 DATA'S VOICE (V.O.) / Proceeding with departure. Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare for docking, level one precautions remain in effect.
 GEORDI / I did miss something.
 TROI / Your first watch on Ops?
 WORF / I've served at the position before.
 TROI / I've been concerned about you.
 WORF / About me? Why?
 TROI / Because I know how I'd feel if I were asked to replace Data at his station.
 WORF / (to lift) Bridge. (to Troi) Promotion due to the death of a crewmate is commonplace on Klingon ships.
 TROI / I know... but this isn't a Klingon ship... and Data was your friend. (beat) And it is the second time you've replaced a crewmate who's died.
 WORF / I honor Data's memory as I did Lieutenant Yar's by attempting to perform their duties as well as they did.
 TROI / (with respect) In true Klingon fashion.
 WORF / (softly) I appreciate your... concern.
 GEORDI / Okay, computer, now replay shuttle audio transmission... time index zero-four-two-three... (to Wesley) Data's second trip...
 DATA'S VOICE (RECORDED) / Proceeding with departure. Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare for docking, level one precautions remain in effect. (a long beat) Shuttle has cleared Jovis cargo bay.
 WESLEY / It sounds the same as the first trip...
 GEORDI / Exactly the same. That's protocol. And that's Data. Following protocol to the letter. Computer, replay shuttle audio transmission, time index zero-four-three-nine... (to Wes) Third and final trip.
 DATA'S VOICE (RECORDED) / Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare for docking, level one precautions remain in effect.
 GEORDI / That's it. The last communication.
 WESLEY / He didn't report when the shuttle had cleared the cargo bay of the Jovis.
 GEORDI / (devil's advocate) Of course, there really wasn't any reason for him to make voice contact. He knew we'd be monitoring his position... and any other pilot might not bother. But Data... not following standard procedures?
 WESLEY / What do you think it means?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure, Wes. I suppose he could've been too busy... maybe he saw something was wrong...
 WESLEY / Without communicating it? That doesn't sound like Data either.
 GEORDI / (acknowledges) Which means maybe something was wrong with him. But there's no other indication of that. In anything he said or did during the mission. None. (beat) I'd sure like to talk to the last people who saw him alive.
 WESLEY / Entering the Beta Agni system, Commander.
 RIKER / Slow to impulse, Mister Crusher.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to bridge.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Commander.
 GEORDI / Captain, a class two probe has been loaded with the hytritium compound and is ready to launch.
 PICARD / Acknowledged.
 WESLEY / Approaching Beta Agni Two.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, take us into a close orbit. Mister Data, scan the --
 PICARD / My apologies, Mister Worf. Scan the colony's subsurface water.
 WORF / Scanning... Tricyanate contamination is confirmed. Levels approaching forty-two parts per million.
 RIKER / Area affected?
 WORF / Thirty square kilometers.
 PICARD / Any indication of the source?
 WORF / Highest concentration is eight kilometers west of the colony.
 RIKER / Adjust target coordinates.
 WESLEY / Aye, Commander.
 GEORDI / Captain, based on these figures, the eighty kilos of hytritium we have should be enough to neutralize the contamination.
 WESLEY / We're approaching the target coordinates.
 PICARD / Launch probe.
 WORF / Probe on target. Hytritium entering water table... disbursement slightly faster than expected. (frowning) Sir... something unusual.
 PICARD / Specify.
 WORF / I'm getting concentrated tricyanate readings of seventy grams per cubic centimeter at the source coordinates. Much higher than would normally occur.
 RIKER / Any theories, Mister Worf... ?
 WORF / Possibly the result of seismic activity.
 PICARD / Computer, report on geologic instability on Beta Agni Two.
 RIKER / Another theory, Mister Worf?
 PICARD / Number One, perhaps you should take an away team down and have a closer look.
 RIKER / Yes, sir. (to Com) Doctor Crusher, report to Transporter Room Three.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / On my way.
 RIKER / Mister Worf... ?
 DATA / You may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resist your wishes.
 DATA / I do not intend to sit in the chair.
 DATA / I do not recognize it.
 DATA / (reacts) The Varon-T disruptor is banned in the Federation.
 DATA / It is a most lethal weapon.
 DATA / I am prepared to die. However, I doubt very much that you would destroy me since you assign so much value to possessing me.
 DATA (O.S.) / Fajo...
 BEVERLY / The contamination has been neutralized. Water's clean.
 WORF / Most curious. (off Riker's look) The process of neutralization should have taken several hours. Naturally occuring tricyanate doesn't respond this quickly.
 RIKER / Are you saying this was not naturally occuring?
 WORF / (adjusts tricorder) There are no natural trace elements present in these tricyanate crystals.
 RIKER / If it's artificial, then we're talking about sabotage.
 BEVERLY / With tricyanate? That's hard to believe. (off Riker's look) It's slow to assimilate, difficult to replicate, and hard to transport. There are a lot easier ways to poison a water supply. A lot more effective ways too. Toxins that can't be neutralized. Bacteriologic agents with no cures at all.
 RIKER / Can you think of any reason why a saboteur might choose tricyanate?
 BEVERLY / Not really. (beat; well, maybe... ) It might pass for a natural disaster. And since there's only one way to treat it... with hytritium, maybe someone figured we wouldn't locate any... it is hard to come by.
 RIKER / You know it really was lucky, wasn't it... ? (off their look) That we were able to find hytritium when we did. Just enough hytritium for this crisis.
 RIKER / Fajo showed up in the right place at the right time... just when we needed him the most...
 PICARD / You're suggesting he created the problem just to solve it?
 RIKER / Possibly.
 GEORDI / To make a profit from his sale of hytritium... ?
 BEVERLY / That doesn't add up. The cost of producing tricyanate is too expensive. He wouldn't make a profit... quite the contrary.
 WORF / Then, why would he do it?
 RIKER / What could he want?
 PICARD / Computer, biographical file on trader Kivas Fajo.
 PICARD / Computer, that will suffice.
 RIKER / A rare and valuable object...
 GEORDI / If Data wasn't on the shuttle...
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Mister Crusher...
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir...
 PICARD / Set course for the site of the shuttlepod explosion. Warp eight.
 DATA / It seemed a distinct possibility.
 DATA / What did you expect?
 DATA / Thank you.
 DATA / Is something troubling you, Varria?
 DATA / Thirty-seven degrees Celsius. Adjustable. I chose this temperature to approximate human skin texture.
 DATA / Physically, I am capable of performing many human functions. However, I have no emotional responses.
 DATA / I have had one sexual encounter. But I am incapable of making love as you describe it since I cannot feel love.
 DATA / Why?
 DATA / It is an act that symbolizes the highest level of intimacy between beings. I have told you that I am unable to feel intimacy. I find it difficult to accept that you could have intimate feelings toward me under these conditions. Therefore you are either simply curious. Or you have been sent by Kivas Fajo to test my sexual abilities.
 WESLEY / The Jovis has a maximum speed of warp three. He's had twenty-three hours... so we can define a perimeter of point-one-oh-two light years as his possible range...
 RIKER / And Fajo doesn't know we're onto him, so he probably isn't taxing his engines by going at top speed.
 WESLEY / He could have made it to the Nel Bato system... maybe even the Giles Belt...
 PICARD / He's a trader... he doesn't attract customers by being hard to find...
 RIKER / We could put out a coded level two query to all Federation ouposts within the perimeter...
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / The consequences to you if we're caught...
 WORF / Sir, affirmative response from station Lya Four...
 RIKER / Fajo spent almost half a day in orbit... departed just over seven hours ago.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, new coordinates... set a course for Lya Four...
 WESLEY / Coordinates already laid in, sir...
 PICARD / Engage.
 DATA / Perhaps if I attempted to communicate with the Enterprise...
 DATA / I have been trained in evasive maneuvers...
 DATA / (warning) Varria...
 DATA / You will surrender yourself to the authorities.
 DATA / I cannot permit this to continue.
 RIKER / Discharged... ?
 RIKER / Welcome back, Mister Data. Are you all right?
 DATA / Yes, Commander. Please arrange to take Kivas Fajo into custody for murder, kidnapping, theft...
 RIKER / (interrupting) Arrangements have already been made.
 DATA / A Varon-T disruptor. It belongs to Fajo.
 RIKER / (curious) Mister O'Brien says the weapon was in a state of discharge...
 DATA / (beat) Perhaps something happened during transport, Commander.
 DATA / I expected none.
 DATA / So it seems.
 DATA / Unlikely. Your collection has been confiscated pending your trial. All of your stolen possessions are being returned to their rightful owners. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / You have lost everything you value.
 DATA / No, sir, it does not. I do not feel pleasure. I am only an android.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43917.4 The Enterprise has been given the singular honor of hosting the first face to face meeting between the Federation and the mysterious race of beings known as the Legarans. We are in orbit around Vulcan preparing to welcome aboard the Federation ambassador that has made this historic event possible.
 PICARD and RIKER are walking to the Transporter Room. / They are in dress uniforms.
 RIKER / (slightly awed) I can remember studying his career in school... the treaty of Alpha Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission to the Federation, the Klingon Alliance...
 PICARD / I met him once... Many years ago, just briefly at his son's wedding. (smiles at memory) But I'll tell you it was quite a moment for a young lieutenant. Standing in the presence of such history... I was a little tongue-tied to be quite frank...
 RIKER / You... tongue-tied?
 PICARD / Indeed. After all, how does one make small talk with a man who has virtually shaped the Federation...
 RIKER / Is it true that he'll be retiring after this mission?
 PICARD / Unofficially, that's what I hear. And what a crowning achievement this will be to his career. The benefits of relations with the Legarans are incalculable.
 PICARD / Has the ambassador been delayed?
 PICARD / By all means.
 RIKER / We had planned for a ship's concert this evening.
 PICARD / Yes, I believe that the ambassador is extremely fond of Mozart.
 PICARD / You have my assurance that the ambassador will not be disturbed during our voyage.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard the Enterprise Ambassador Sarek.
 PICARD / Your service honors us.
 PICARD / Mrs. Sarek.
 PICARD / This is my first officer, Commander Riker.
 RIKER / If you'll follow me, sir.
 WESLEY / Are the Legarans really going to sit in this stuff?
 GEORDI / Well, I'm sure not.
 WESLEY / Can you believe this smell?
 GEORDI / What smell?
 GEORDI / What can I say... to us it's a slime pit, to them it's home.
 WESLEY / (a little eager) The environmental controls are ready. What's next?
 GEORDI / Why? Are you in some kind of hurry?
 WESLEY / I have... sort of a date.
 GEORDI / (surprised) With who?
 WESLEY / (shy, but proud) Ensign Dumont.
 GEORDI / (whistles) That is one attractive lady. I've got to admit I'm surprised.
 WESLEY / (grinning) What, that she'd go out with me?
 GEORDI / No, that you had the nerve to ask her. Way to go Wesley.
 PICARD / No Ambassador. Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher are---
 PICARD / Ambassador, please be assured that everything will be ready by the time the conference begins.
 TROI / So what was the ambassador like?
 RIKER / The way Mendrossen described him, I expected him to be a frail old man.
 PICARD / I hope I'm that frail when I'm two hundred and two. His aides did seem a little overprotective, didn't they?
 RIKER / From what I could see, the ambassador doesn't need to be protected from anything.
 PICARD / Nevertheless, we will honor Mister Mendrossen's request and allow Ambassador Sarek his privacy. (beat, sighs) I suppose they were foolish and vain, my expectations of this voyage. Sharing his thoughts, his memories, his unique understanding of the history he has made...
 TROI / Does this mean you're going to cancel the concert this evening?
 PICARD / No, the concert will go on as scheduled. But it is a pity that the guest of honor will be absent.
 RIKER / For all we know, the ambassador might enjoy an evening's entertainment...
 TROI / (to Picard) Why not ask his wife if she'd like to attend?
 PICARD / I think that's an excellent idea.
 PICARD / The bridge is yours, Number One.
 PICARD / I hope I'm not intruding.
 PICARD / Actually, I came to see you.
 PICARD / I find that hard to believe.
 PICARD / The honor is ours.
 PICARD / (reacts with pleasure) High praise from a Vulcan.
 PICARD / Logical.
 PICARD / I have come to extend my personal invitation to you... and your husband, if he is available, to attend a Mozart recital this evening.
 PICARD / I'm sure it could be arranged.
 PICARD / Well, then I hope to see you tonight.
 WESLEY / The temperature in the tank is now one hundred fifty degrees Celsius.
 GEORDI / Okay, lock it off.
 WESLEY / Is that it? Can I get out of here?
 GEORDI / What's your hurry? You don't really think something's gonna happen between you and Suzanne Dumont...
 WESLEY / At least I'm not spending the night with a good book like some people...
 GEORDI / What's that supposed to mean?
 WESLEY / Just what it sounds like.
 GEORDI / You'd get more action out of a good book than you'll ever see on this date, I guarantee it... she's not going to waste her time with someone like you.
 WESLEY / Someone like me?
 GEORDI / She's way out of your league.
 WESLEY / Since when did you become an expert on women?
 GEORDI / Compared to you, every man on this ship is an expert on women.
 WESLEY / At least I don't have to find my women in the Holodeck!
 GEORDI / (deadly) What did you say?
 WESLEY / You heard me!
 RIKER / Something wrong?
 RIKER / (edge of command in voice) I asked a question.
 GEORDI / No, sir. Nothing wrong here.
 WESLEY / (to Riker) May I be excused, Commander?
 RIKER / Anything you want to talk about, Geordi?
 GEORDI / No, sir.
 PICARD / I noticed that Lieutenant Worf put Ensign D'Amato on report... for insubordination.
 RIKER / D'Amato's been an exemplary officer.
 PICARD / Indeed he has. Look into it, Number One. (beat) I assume work has been progressing in the conference room?
 RIKER / Yes, sir. I checked on Geordi and Wesley a few hours ago. (beat while he wonders whether to mention it) For a moment there... I thought that the two of them were actually going to... hit one another.
 PICARD / Ambassador Sarek, Perrin... on behalf of my entire crew, welcome.
 PICARD / This is Commander Data. He will be the featured soloist this evening.
 DATA / (to Perrin) We will start the evening with Mozart's string quartet number six. I am programmed to reproduce the individual musical styles of over three hundred concert violinists, including Heifitz, Menuhin, Grak-tay and Tataglia. Do you have a preference?
 DATA / I hope you find the performance pleasing.
 PICARD / At your convenience, Commander.
 WESLEY / Hi Mom. I got a message you wanted to see me?
 BEVERLY / I thought you were going to be at the concert last night.
 WESLEY / I said I might be going. Suzanne wanted to go to the arboretum.
 BEVERLY / Captain Picard asked where you were. I don't like having to make excuses for you.
 WESLEY / (surprised) Excuses? Come on, Mom... it wasn't an official function.
 BEVERLY / You have responsibilities young man and I expect you to live up to them!
 WESLEY / Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
 BEVERLY / Don't talk back to me!
 WESLEY / (hurt) Okay, I won't.
 BEVERLY / Where do you think you're going?
 WESLEY / (strong) Away from you.
 WESLEY / Mom!
 BEVERLY / ... and then I just slapped him. Really hard. (incredulous) I slapped Wesley.
 TROI / Do you know why you did it?
 BEVERLY / (on the verge of tears) I never hit my son in his life.
 TROI / (soothing, yet with trace of urgency) Beverly, this is important. What were you thinking when you hit Wes?
 BEVERLY / (thinks for a beat) That's just it... I wasn't thinking about anything. I was... just angry... so angry.
 TROI / And Wesley didn't provoke you in any way? It wasn't anything he said, anything he did?
 BEVERLY / No. It was a sudden... burst of anger. I still can't believe I did it.
 TROI / I don't know why you did it either, Beverly. But I can tell you that I've heard the same kind of story from ten different people in the past two days.
 DATA / Yes. It is normally occupied by Captain Picard, Commander Riker, and Counselor Troi.
 DATA / Half-Betazoid. Her father was human.
 DATA / Her skills are empathic in nature. She can sense the emotions of other beings.
 DATA / (surprised) Extensive. The captain's first diplomatic contact dates back to Stardate---
 DATA / (puzzled) Do you foresee such a circumstance occurring? Is Ambassador Sarek unable to --
 GEORDI / Hey guys, some kind of problem here?
 GEORDI / (light) There are plenty of other tables.
 GEORDI / Why don't I get everyone another round of drinks?
 RIKER / I don't need to tell you that insubordination is a serious charge to level against any officer.
 WORF / I am aware of that Commander. However, Ensign D'Amato directly challenged my authority.
 RIKER / Is it my imagination, or have tempers aboard this ship been getting a little frayed lately?
 WORF / I hadn't noticed.
 WORF / I see what you mean.
 RIKER / Geordi, what the hell is going on here?
 GEORDI / I wish I knew.
 WORF / (hits combadge) Security team to Ten-Forward.
 RIKER / All right, that's enough!
 GEORDI / ... and the next thing I know somebody's left hook is on its way to my chin.
 TROI / Captain, this is not an isolated incident. There have been reports of random violence all over the ship...
 PICARD / (reacts) Are you suggesting it is somehow contagious?
 BEVERLY / There's no indication of a virus or bacteria... I've run every test I know... I've checked the water, the food replicators, airborne samples...
 PICARD / This is one hell of a time... (beat, to Riker) Whatever it is, I don't want it to affect the ambassador... I want his quarters isolated from the rest of the crew until we can identify the cause.
 TROI / It's not that simple, Captain.
 BEVERLY / We've been able to determine that these outbreaks of violence started... at virtually the same time Sarek's party beamed aboard the ship.
 BEVERLY / We do have a working theory...
 BEVERLY / We believe it's possible that Ambassador Sarek himself is responsible for these incidents.
 PICARD / Sarek?
 TROI / I felt something from him during the concert... it was vague and undefined... but very disturbing...
 PICARD / (a small realization) He cried. I saw that. I didn't believe it. A Vulcan moved to tears by music... ?
 TROI / Vulcans have the same basic emotions that we do. But they have learned to repress them. At the concert, I was sensing that Sarek had lost control...
 PICARD / What would cause such a loss of control?
 BEVERLY / There is a very rare condition that sometimes affects Vulcans over the age of two hundred. Bendii Syndrome.
 TROI / The early symptoms include sudden bursts of emotion, mostly irrational anger. Eventually, all emotional control is lost.
 PICARD / I can't imagine anything that would be more offensive to a Vulcan. Their emotional detachment is the very core of their being. (beat) But why would it affect others aboard the ship?
 TROI / Vulcans possess telepathic ability. Sarek could be unintentionally projecting these intense emotions onto other people... at random.
 PICARD / And when the Legarans beam aboard...
 BEVERLY / They could very well be affected too.
 PICARD / Is there a treatment?
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head, no) Can't anyone take his place?
 PICARD / Sarek has built a personal relationship with them. They will accept no one else. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) How can we confirm your diagnosis?
 BEVERLY / We grow a culture from the tissue of the metathalamus... but the results will take several days.
 PICARD / I have twelve hours.
 PICARD / Nevertheless, I believe we are facing a potentially far worse...
 PICARD / Mister Mendrossen...
 PICARD / I cannot explain that. Hundreds of others on board have not been affected either. I have not. The effects appear to be random. Proximity apparently has no bearing on the phenomenon.
 PICARD / (to comm) Mister Data, please report to my Ready Room.
 DATA / Captain Picard is not satisfied with Ki Mendrossen's assurances that the ambassador is in good health. Do you consider Sarek capable of carrying out his mission?
 DATA / You have voiced certain reservations about his abilities to me.
 DATA / Directly, no. However, you did question me on the diplomatic capabilities of both Captain Picard and Counselor Troi.
 DATA / Then you must decide which is your greater obligation: your loyalty to Sarek or your duty to the Federation.
 DATA / Can you accept the logic of continuing the mission?
 DATA / Sakkath has been able, until very recently, to use his telepathic skills to reinforce Sarek's emotional control and thus protect others from the effects of his deterioration.
 RIKER / He hasn't been doing a very good job...
 DATA / The strain of this mission on Sarek has made it impossible.
 PICARD / Ironic isn't it? Despite our magnificent technology, we find ourselves still susceptible to the ravages of old age. The loss of dignity, the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master.
 PICARD / (a beat) Still want to be one of us, Data?
 DATA / Sir, it is conceivable that even for me, time will eventually lead to a irreparable circuit failure. But there is one thing I do not understand...
 PICARD / Yes... ?
 DATA / Sarek is a logical, intelligent being. The effects of Bendii Syndrome are apparent. Why would such a man choose to ignore them?
 PICARD / Logic fails us sometimes, Data. This is one of those times. I can only guess that he does not see or does not wish to see the truth. And he is being insulated from that truth by those who love him the most.
 RIKER / Someone has to confront him.
 PICARD / (quietly) It is not a task I look forward to.
 RIKER / I don't understand this... everyone's protecting Sarek... his wife, Mendrossen, even you.
 PICARD / What would you have me do... march down there and destroy the man?
 RIKER / The mission with the Legarans cannot go forward with Sarek in this condition.
 PICARD / I know --
 RIKER / (hits table) Then tell him that there is no---
 PICARD / Don't you tell me...
 DATA / Captain... Commander...
 PICARD / (nodding with grim resignation) You're right of course, Number One. But I am loathe to do what I must do.
 PICARD / He is very ill, Perrin.
 PICARD / There is one now. Sakkath knows.
 PICARD / He knows. More than that, he has been consciously holding Sarek's mind together on this mission as well as he could...
 PICARD / I must see Sarek.
 PICARD / I'm sorry.
 PICARD / The loss is mine, Ambassador.
 PICARD / Unfortunately the results would not be available for several days... which is why I must ask for a postponement of the conference.
 PICARD / Then why must Sakkath help you contain your emotions?
 PICARD / I hope I have not embarrassed you, Ambassador.
 PICARD / I believe you are affected, sir... far more than you realize.
 PICARD / There has been an epidemic of violent incidents aboard the Enterprise. As we speak, the situation is worsening.
 PICARD / My chief medical officer has explored all other probable causes.
 PICARD / That is correct.
 PICARD / She is... but the fact remains that these incidents began shortly after your arrival.
 PICARD / Is it also coincidence, that your wife and chief of staff have been carefully isolating you?
 PICARD / Surely Sakkath is not influenced by emotions.
 PICARD / (starting to press) But you did need his help at the concert.
 PICARD / (continuing) Or perhaps you have a logical explanation for what happened that night?
 PICARD / I saw you crying.
 PICARD / I was there... I saw the tears.
 PICARD / (forceful) Then you were emotionally affected by the music.
 PICARD / You still have not answered me, Sarek. Is it logical for a Vulcan to cry?
 PICARD / (pressing) No other logical solutions? But Ambassador, there are always other solutions. You have said so yourself many times.
 PICARD / Sarek of Vulcan was never afraid to look straight at something he did not want to see.
 PICARD / Sarek of Vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth.
 PICARD / Is that anger I hear in your voice?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. In three hours time we are scheduled to meet with the Legaran delegation. However it is now all too evident that Ambassador Sarek is in no condition to proceed with the conference.
 RIKER / We're entering the Legaran system, Captain. Shall I have Mister Worf contact their ambassador?
 PICARD / (turns) No. (off Riker's look) I will present our regrets to the Legarans personally. It is vital that they understand our reasons for cancelling the negotiations.
 RIKER / (quietly) Captain, with all due respect... I think you did the right thing.
 PICARD / But at what cost, Number One?
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / (surprised) Perrin?
 RIKER / I'll be on the bridge, sir.
 PICARD / (with concern) How is the ambassador?
 PICARD / You know that's impossible.
 PICARD / He will never lose that respect.
 PICARD / I'm not blaming anyone.
 PICARD / Believe me, nothing would give me greater pleasure. But there's nothing I can do.
 PICARD / Yes, Ambassador, I do. But I also realize the potential benefits.
 PICARD / Which, for a few hours, should provide you with the emotional control you need. Enough time for you to meet with the Legarans and conclude the treaty.
 PICARD / I am aware of the risks, Sarek. But I believe it is the only... logical solution.
 BEVERLY / I can't say I approve of this, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / I didn't expect you would, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / Is there some way I can talk you out of it?
 PICARD / I'm afraid not. Though I do admit to a certain... trepidation. (beat, then smiling) Your company is appreciated.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher will be monitoring our responses.
 DATA / Commander, the Legarans are ready to beam aboard.
 RIKER / Very well...
 RIKER / Yes... Ambassador.
 PICARD / NO!!!
 PICARD / It is wrong. A lifetime of discipline washed away, and in its place... bedlam... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Nothing but bedlam. (angry) And I am helpless to prevent it! I am old! Nothing left but dry bones and dead friends. (exhausted) Weary, so weary.
 BEVERLY / It will pass. All of it. Another hour or so at most. You're doing fine... Just hold on.
 PICARD / No! This weakness disgusts me! I hate it! Where is the logic? I am betrayed by desires... I want to... feel... to feel everything! (a whisper) But I am Vulcan. (voice rising) I must feel nothing. Give me back control...
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc...
 PICARD / Perrin... (tears begin to stream down his face) Amanda... I could have given you so much more. I wanted to show you tenderness. But it is not our way. Spock... Amanda did you know... ? Perrin, can you know... how much I... love you? (anguished cry) I do love you!
 PICARD / (a hoarse whisper) Beverly...
 BEVERLY / I'm here... I'm not going to leave you.
 PICARD / It's so... difficult.
 PICARD / The anguish in the man... despair... pouring out... so many... feelings... regrets...
 PICARD / I can't stop them...
 BEVERLY / (whispers) Don't even try.
 RIKER / First officer's log, Stardate 43920.7. Ambassador Sarek has successfully concluded the negotiations with the Legarans. The USS Merrimac has arrived and will transport the ambassador and his party back to Vulcan.
 PICARD / I hope your journey aboard the Merrimac will be uneventful.
 RIKER / What will happen to him then?
 PICARD / He... loves you... very much.
 PICARD / I hope you are wrong, Ambassador.
 PICARD / I believe I got the best part of that bargain, Ambassador.
 PICARD / Peace and long life, Sarek.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 43980.7. The Enterprise has been in attendance at the biennial Trade Agreements Conference on Betazed.
 A busy place. Conference delegates from different worlds are here, including three Ferengi: TOG, FAREK, and NIBOR. In b.g., a MUSICIAN entertains the gathering, playing a complex RHYTHM on a strange percussion instrument. RIKER plays three-dimensional chess with Nibor as WESLEY looks on. PICARD, TROI, and DATA socialize with their guests as Log is completed: / 
 PICARD (V.O.) / For the first time, the Ferengi are present, and I have reluctantly consented to their boarding the Enterprise for the closing reception.
 RIKER / Check... and mate.
 WESLEY / Perfect. A queen's gambit... finished off with the Aldabren Exchange.
 WESLEY / It's Algolian ceremonial rhythms.
 PICARD / (lifting glass) A toast to the success of the trade conference, Reittan. I must admit, I had some doubts when you invited the Ferengi.
 DATA / (ever the scientist) Perhaps your telepathic abilities are ineffective owing to the anomalous construction of the Ferengi brain, which is composed of four different...
 PICARD / (not now, Data) Thank you, Data. (to Reittan Grax) It was thoughtful of you to include Lwaxana Troi as part of the Betazed delegation.
 PICARD / I'm sure Counselor Troi appreciates this opportunity to spend time with her mother.
 TROI / (aloud) Mother, we're among non-telepaths... it's impolite not to speak aloud.
 TROI / (interrupting) Let's not guess what I might have done. I love my work aboard the Enterprise...
 RIKER / Deanna, Lwaxana. Anything I can do for you?
 PICARD / (thinking fast) Uh... perhaps later, Lwaxana. Data and I were just about to show Reittan Grax the new door mechanisms on the aft Turbolifts. Would you excuse us?
 TROI / (lightly) Are we at war with the Ferengi yet?
 WORF / Daimon Tog has returned to his vessel and the Ferengi have left orbit.
 TROI / I'm sure Mother will be relieved.
 WORF / I hear she handled the situation quite skillfully. An admirable woman.
 TROI / I'll be sure to tell her you said so.
 TROI / Mother. (more firmly) Mother, please.
 TROI / Mother, the Chalice of Rixx is an old clay pot with mold growing inside it!
 TROI / (sincerely) That's true. I'm sorry, and I didn't mean to be upset with you at the reception.
 TROI / (a tad irritated) I am happy. Why can't you believe that?
 TROI / I get great satisfaction out of my work.
 TROI / This is my family -- my friends -- here on the Enterprise.
 TROI / Look, Mother. Perhaps some day I'll marry. But you've got to let me make my own choices... live my own life, not the life you'd choose for me.
 TROI / (angry now) I did not ruin anything. We became very good friends.
 TROI / Little One? When I was five you called me that. Stop demeaning me and address me as an adult.
 WESLEY / Adding preprocessors to the neutrino counters boosted efficiency by eleven percent. Of course, Commander La Forge and Commander Data did most of the work...
 GEORDI / Not so fast, Wesley. Preprocessing the data with an optical chip was your idea.
 DATA / Correct, sir. Although Commander La Forge and I designed the chip, Ensign Crusher derived the equations governing its operation.
 RIKER / The point is, you've completed our upgrade well ahead of schedule. Most impressive.
 PICARD / Indeed, Number One. Fine work -- especially you, Mister Crusher. We're going to miss you.
 PICARD (cont'd) / As you might guess, your final entrance examination scores for Starfleet Academy have arrived. (a beat) Congratulations. As soon as you complete the oral exam, you'll be formally admitted.
 RIKER / We'll have you back at Betazed in plenty of time to meet the Academy transport ship.
 WESLEY / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / That will be all.
 PICARD (cont'd) / A moment, Number One.
 RIKER / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / Your science team is very efficient. How many days would you say they managed to shave off our mission?
 RIKER / Approximately three. Thanks to the equipment upgrade, we'll be able to complete our survey in less than twenty-four hours.
 PICARD / Splendid, Number One. (a beat) You'd agree that this is a rather routine mapping mission?
 RIKER / (what's he getting at?) Yes, sir...
 PICARD / Counselor Troi had the good sense to request shore leave. I see I'm going to have to suggest it to you.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Have a good time, Number One.
 RIKER / I'm sure it was around here somewhere...
 TROI / It's been a few years. Maybe it died.
 RIKER / You know Muktok plants live for hundreds of years...
 RIKER (cont'd) / Here it is...
 TROI / It's lovely. I remember this music... and all the good times we had.
 RIKER / A certain junior lieutenant will always remember meeting a very serious psychology student. It was the best thing about being assigned to Betazed.
 TROI / (irritated) Mother! How did you know about this place?
 RIKER / (keeping it light) And you even brought provisions. Very thoughtful.
 RIKER / (trying it) Very, very tasty. (he eyes her) Tell me, Lwaxana, the last time we met, you were searching for a husband. Did you have any luck?
 TROI / Mother, this isn't the time or the place...
 TROI / (angry) You didn't have to.
 RIKER / (an honest answer) There was a time when I thought having children and a career in Starfleet were incompatible. But with Galaxy class starships having families aboard, I've considered that possibility...
 TROI / (warning) Mother!
 TROI / (furious now) Mother, stop it!
 RIKER / (to keep peace) Deanna, try one of the oskoids. They're different.
 RIKER (cont'd) / What the... ?
 RIKER / Daimon Tog! I thought the Krayton left orbit hours ago.
 TROI / I don't believe this...
 RIKER / No, Tog!
 RIKER / Deanna? Lwaxana?
 RIKER / (indicating Nibor) From the smell of things, I'd say we're aboard a Ferengi vessel.
 RIKER / Tog must have missed that chapter in the Ferengi Book of Etiquette.
 RIKER / The Enterprise is too far out of range.
 RIKER / (angry) What have you done with them?
 TROI / Why have you removed our clothing?
 TROI (TELEPATHIC V.O.) / I don't like the sound of this, mother.
 GEORDI / Fifteen hours from Gamma Erandi, and the subspace static is already playing hell with communications...
 WESLEY / Just what we might expect in a stellar nursery.
 DATA / Wesley, my congratulations on passing your Starfleet written examinations. An excellent achievement.
 WESLEY / Thanks, Data. Now if I can just do well on the oral exam...
 GEORDI / You will. And when you return, we'll be gaining the best ensign in the fleet.
 DATA / Actually, there is no guarantee Wesley will be reassigned to the Enterprise. Eighty-four per cent of Starfleet graduates are not posted to Galaxy class starships for their first assignment.
 WESLEY / I never thought about that... I always assumed I'd be coming back to the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / I'm sure Captain Picard will request you... if he's still commanding the Enterprise when you graduate.
 WESLEY / I hadn't thought about that, either. (MORE)
 WESLEY (Cont'd) / (thinks) I never thought I'd feel this way about leaving the Enterprise... and all of you.
 DATA / Is that not a part of the human experience -- growth and change?
 WESLEY / (considers it) I suppose so...
 GEORDI / I felt the same way when I left my family to go to the Academy. But it was one of the best times of my life. You're going to meet new friends, have adventures you can't even imagine yet...
 WESLEY / (unconvinced) I hope you're right, Geordi.
 TROI / (low, to Riker) So far, mother's in no danger. (a beat) I hope she knows what she's doing...
 RIKER / She's bought us some time... let's make the most of it.
 RIKER (cont'd) / I wouldn't do that...
 RIKER / The hell you don't. You're two moves away from being mated.
 RIKER (cont'd) / Hey, I warned you. Now you've only got one possible escape...
 RIKER (cont'd) / ... and that wasn't it.
 RIKER (cont'd) / See? You should've moved the bishop --
 RIKER / (shrugs) Okay, don't listen. Forget that I beat you in thirty moves...
 RIKER / I was being polite. I could've won in twenty moves.
 RIKER / Pawn to King's Bishop Three, Queen's Level.
 DATA / Initial scans of ionization patterns complete, sir. Now correlating sensor readings.
 PICARD / (indicating screen) It's almost incomprehensible, the amount of energy being expended...
 DATA / Actually, it is five point three four times ten to the forty-first watts... well within the norm for phenomena of this type.
 PICARD / Perhaps... but that takes away none of the wonder.
 WESLEY / Come in.
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / Hi. I brought you something...
 WESLEY / I hope it's small, because I'm taking way too much as it is...
 BEVERLY / Your friend Guinan sent this up from Ten Forward. It's not to pack -- it's for me to propose a toast with.
 BEVERLY (cont'd) / To a future Starfleet officer.
 WESLEY / Mom -- thanks.
 BEVERLY / I won't say "give it your best" because I know you will. I won't say "make me proud"... because you already have. So I'll just say... here's to your future.
 WESLEY / This was Dad's...
 BEVERLY / (nods) From the Stargazer. Do you have room for it?
 WESLEY / No... but I'm taking it anyway.
 RIKER / I'm sick of this game.
 RIKER / Who's losing? I'm just tired of standing up.
 RIKER / It's too hard to play from in here. I can't even see the whole board.
 RIKER / I might...
 RIKER / (with disdain) What -- you're afraid I'd try to escape? What would that get me? You'd still have her. And besides... where would I go?
 RIKER / Fine. Thanks for the game.
 RIKER / Those Ferengi have iron jaws...
 TROI / Good work, Mother.
 TROI (cont'd) / According to mother, Daimon Tog is... extremely relaxed at the moment.
 RIKER / Tell Lwaxana to keep him relaxed while we call the cavalry...
 TROI / Let's see just how relaxed Daimon Tog is...
 TROI (TELEPATHIC V.O.) / Mother -- we're out of the cell and we're trying to contact the Enterprise... but we can't do it without Tog's access code. Do you think --
 WORF / Subspace interference is subsiding... communications have been restored...
 PICARD / Good. Contact Commander Riker on Betazed.
 WORF / (observing panel) Message coming in from Betazed, sir. Priority One.
 PICARD / (concerned) On screen.
 PICARD / Our communications were blocked by the nebula, Reittan. Is there a problem?
 WORF / Mister Homn was no help?
 DATA / Lieutenant Foley found these in the pond. The species is Zan Periculi. It is not indigenous to Betazed, but to Lappa IV... a Ferengi world.
 PICARD / We now have a reasonable hypothesis as to whom.
 WORF / The difficult question is where.
 GEORDI / The Ferengi ship is almost as fast as the Enterprise... she could be just about anywhere by now.
 PICARD / Commander Riker will assume that we'll be searching for them... he'll find some way to send us a message. (a beat) Mister Worf, I want continual monitoring of all Ferengi subspace frequencies. Mister La Forge, can you extend our sensor range?
 GEORDI / (thinking) If I narrow the band and tie in long-range sensors to the subspace scanners, I can boost the gain...
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / Do you wish to leave orbit?
 PICARD / Not until we have someplace to go.
 RIKER / (shakes his head) I've tried everything I know... and it's no use. Without Tog's security code, I can't get near the communication system.
 TROI / We're running out of time... Farek's about to begin the neural scan on mother.
 RIKER / (thinking) Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. If I pick a minor subsystem... something non-essential...
 RIKER (cont'd) / Like this... the warp field phase adjustment. All this does is suppress the subspace interference generated by the warp engines.
 TROI / Meaning what?
 RIKER / Meaning if I set up a simple oscillation, I can send out a signal. (studying schematic) The trick is to create a message that the Enterprise will understand... but that the Ferengi will think is just normal subspace static.
 RIKER (cont'd) / What's wrong?
 TROI / Mother...
 TROI / Will... (again a cry of pain quickly suppressed) ... we've got to help her...
 RIKER / Come on.
 GEORDI / (to Wesley) Thanks for the help, but you'd better get aboard the Bradbury -- they were ready to leave orbit an hour ago.
 WESLEY / (nods) Soon as we're sure this works...
 GEORDI / (to Picard) Initiating scans now, sir.
 PICARD / Can we locate the Krayton?
 DATA / Ferengi transmissions are routinely scrambled and encoded, sir. Without breaking the code, we will be unable to identify any specific Ferengi vessel.
 GEORDI / (as he works) And Ferengi codes are damn near impossible to break...
 PICARD / Gentlemen, I have the utmost confidence in your ability to perform the impossible.
 WORF / Captain, the Bradbury is hailing us. They can no longer delay their departure.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher -- now. We have no time for lengthy farewells. Good luck.
 WESLEY / Thank you, sir.
 DATA / The repetitive nature of the subcarrier pattern would imply a modified Greenlaw-Huffman encoding scheme...
 GEORDI / Okay, I'll reverse-engineer the algorithm using a Pileggi sequence...
 BEVERLY / Wesley... take care.
 WESLEY / You too, Mom.
 BEVERLY / Something the matter?
 WESLEY / We've been scanning Ferengi transmissions, trying to find the Krayton. One of the signals was... I don't know... familiar somehow...
 BEVERLY / Something in the message?
 WESLEY / No -- the message was scrambled... (suddenly it clicks) It was the static.
 BEVERLY / Where are you going?
 WORF / Sir, the Bradbury informs us they can wait no longer for Mister Crusher to come aboard.
 WESLEY / Captain, I think there's a pattern to the subspace interference I heard on one of the Ferengi messages.
 PICARD / Wesley, unless you leave immediately, you'll miss --
 WESLEY / The interference itself could be a message. If I could just hear a replay of the subspace scans...
 PICARD / (to Worf) Signal the Bradbury they may depart. (to Data) Play back the Ferengi transmissions...
 WESLEY / Wait -- repeat that one. Put it on a continuous replay.
 WESLEY (cont'd) / Hear that popping noise? Data, can you filter out everything but that sound?
 GEORDI / That's Cochrane distortion... a fluctuation in the phase of the subspace field. All warp engines generate that kind of interference.
 WESLEY / But listen to the pattern... it's the Algolian ceremonial rhythm the musician was playing at the reception.
 DATA / Mister Crusher is correct, sir. There is a temporal correlation.
 PICARD / Then it is a signal from Commander Riker. (with admiration) Ingenious. He selected a signal we'd recognize... but one the Ferengi would dismiss as static.
 WORF / Signal source located, Captain.
 PICARD / Plot an intercept course.
 WESLEY / Course plotted and laid in, sir.
 PICARD / Well done, Mister Crusher. Warp Eight.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Engage.
 RIKER / Get away from her.
 RIKER / Lwaxana, don't.
 RIKER / I can't let you do this...
 TROI / Mother -- we can't just leave you here --
 PICARD / You're both all right?
 RIKER / None the worse for wear.
 TROI / My mother bought our freedom, Captain. But believe me, she doesn't want to stay with Tog.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Hail the Krayton.
 WORF / (works the panel) Sir, Daimon Tog responding.
 PICARD / Of course you were. But you're still holding Lwaxana Troi.
 TROI / I think I know what she's doing. You must fight to get her back, Captain.
 PICARD / It's not over, Lwaxana. You're mine and I refuse to let you go. Return to my side immediately.
 PICARD / "My love is a fever, longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease."
 PICARD / "In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, For they in thee a thousand errors note; But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise; Who in despite of view is pleas'd to dote."
 PICARD / Listen, Tog, no one possesses Lwaxana but me. And if I have to destroy your ship in the process, so be it.
 PICARD / That can be arranged. Mister Worf, arm all phaser banks and photon torpedoes. If my beloved is not in my arms in ten seconds, throw everything you've got at the Krayton.
 PICARD / (shrugs) 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all... Eight, seven...
 PICARD / Six... five...
 PICARD / Three... two...
 PICARD / Such as reporting this incident to your superiors who may question your competency as Daimon? I'll think about it. (to Worf) Screen off.
 PICARD / Mrs. Troi, I'm truly grateful that you risked your life for my... (breaks free) ...people. I'll have you home within hours.
 PICARD / Perhaps another time. Mister Crusher, set course for Betazed. (glancing at Lwaxana) Warp Nine.
 WESLEY / You asked to see me, Captain?
 PICARD / I've been in touch with Admiral Hahn at Starfleet Academy.
 PICARD (cont'd) / The Admiral regrets your missing the oral examination and hopes you'll reapply next year.
 WESLEY / I understand, sir. (a beat) I do intend to reapply.
 PICARD / In the interim... the Academy's loss is our gain. I'm gratified the Enterprise will continue to benefit from your talents for another year.
 WESLEY / Thank you, Captain.
 WESLEY (cont'd) / Is that all, sir?
 PICARD / There is one more thing.
 PICARD (cont'd) / For some time now I have been contemplating a certain action. Your conduct today has convinced me to take that action.
 PICARD (cont'd) / I've reviewed your service record thoroughly... and I've decided upon the appropriate course.
 PICARD (cont'd) / I am granting you a field promotion to full Ensign.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Congratulations. (a beat) You're dismissed.
 WORF / Lwaxana Troi has beamed down to Betazed, Captain.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Notify Starfleet we are en route to the Xanthras system for our rendezvous with the Zapata.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Ensign Crusher, take us out of orbit and set course for Xanthras Three, Warp Factor Six.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir. (works the helm) Course set.
 PICARD / Engage.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 43957.2. We are presently charting an unknown star system located in the Zeta Gelis cluster. This rather routine assignment has made for a refreshingly quiet time aboard the Enterprise.
 GEORDI and WORF are at the bar. Geordi discreetly / indicates a young woman sitting with a friend (it is CHRISTY, whom we last saw in "Booby Trap" telling Geordi that she wasn't interested in him "that way").
 GEORDI / That's her.
 GEORDI / Don't stare.
 WORF / Why not?
 GEORDI / Because she'll see.
 WORF / Good. You must let her see the fire in your eyes.
 GEORDI / But what would I say... ?
 WORF / (acting the wise Lothario) Words come later, it is the scent that first speaks of love.
 GEORDI / Thanks Worf, that really helps me a lot.
 GEORDI / (turning around) Hi, Christy.
 GEORDI / Good.
 GEORDI / Fine... uh really... fine.
 WORF / I have much to teach you about women.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Mister La Forge, report to Transporter Room three.
 RIKER, BEVERLY, and DATA are moving rapidly down the / corridor towards the Transporter Room. A Turbolift OPENS and Geordi ENTERS. He quickly falls in step with the others.
 GEORDI / What's this all about, Commander?
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Sensors have discovered a small one-man ship crashed on the planet.
 BEVERLY / We're picked up life-signs... humanoid, very faint and fading.
 DATA / (using tricorder) Radiation levels within acceptable limits.
 GEORDI / We can beam him out from under there, get him up to Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / He's not stable enough for transport. There's damage to his brain stem, his autonomic functions are failing.
 BEVERLY / His heart needs active neural feedback, it can't regulate itself. I need a volunteer.
 GEORDI / I'm here.
 BEVERLY / I'm going to hook your nervous systems together through my tricorder -- your brain will regulate both systems. That should stabilize him long enough to get him up to the ship.
 BEVERLY / Take deep, regular breaths. If anything goes wrong I'll break the connection.
 BEVERLY / (ready to break connection) Geordi!
 GEORDI / I'm fine... no problem.
 BEVERLY / (nods and hits combadge) Transporter Room, three to beam directly to Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / (to a nurse) Autonomic responses are still low... begin cardiostimulation... (to another nurse) Sixty cc's of inoprovaline... massive infection is setting in... use the protodynoplaser to stabilize his immune system. (looking at monitor) We need to design a virus that can infiltrate his cell structure and boost his ATP production.
 BEVERLY / I want you to give him a full bioscan. See if there are any residual effects from that energy discharge during the neuro-link.
 BEVERLY / (to another nurse) Keep his arm in cryogenic stasis until his vital signs are strong enough to begin surgical procedures.
 PICARD, Riker, Data, and Worf are on the Bridge. / 
 RIKER / From the size and shape of the wreckage, it appeared to be some kind of escape pod. The control system had been heavily damaged, that's probably what caused the crash.
 PICARD / (thoughtfully) An escape pod... then it couldn't have travelled very far. Mister Data, any signs of other ships in this area?
 DATA / (works console) I am picking up a scattering of debris in extended orbit around the planet. It reads as refined metals and other synthetic compounds.
 PICARD / The remains of a larger vessel. He must have left in the pod before the ship was destroyed.
 WORF / (works console) Sensors show trace elements in the debris that would indicate phaser fire was recently exchanged.
 PICARD / Were you able to salvage anything from the escape pod?
 DATA / This is all that is left of the pod's computer system.
 PICARD / Can you access it?
 DATA / It will take time. Downloading it into our system will require fabrication of a matrix translator to emulate the alien's computer system.
 PICARD / Keep me apprised of your progress.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / That's all we can do for now. We won't be able to test neuromuscular function for a few days.
 GEORDI / Can I go now, Doc?
 BEVERLY / No need to keep you here. Your bioscan came out negative.
 GEORDI / I could have told you that. I feel great.
 PICARD / (indicating John) How's your patient, Beverly?
 BEVERLY / I never thought he'd make it this far. There was major trauma to the head and chest cavity, massive plasma loss, and severe damage to most of his organs.
 PICARD / What are his chances?
 BEVERLY / I believe he'll live... but I'm afraid I can't take the credit for it. His body is showing amazing recuperative powers. The damaged tissue is repairing itself at a phenomenal rate. (beat) There's only one thing that troubles me.
 PICARD / Go on.
 BEVERLY / Take a look at this.
 PICARD / Cell regeneration?
 BEVERLY / Yes... the thing is that it has nothing to do with his injuries. These are undamaged cells, but they seem to be mutating.
 PICARD / Any theory as to what's causing it?
 BEVERLY / (shaking head) No. I've never seen anything like it. It's possible this could be part of his natural healing process. I hope it is... because there's nothing I can do to stop it.
 GEORDI / I'm telling you Data, there's got to be some way to decode the information in this thing.
 DATA / I agree Geordi. But the data matrix within the capsule does not correspond to any standard format. All we have been able to determine is that the device uses a chemically based system for molecular energy encoding.
 GEORDI / Yeah, and the computer still can't analyze the specific chemical elements involved. It's got to be part of the data processing system... (a beat as he thinks) What if it's a feedback loop controller?
 DATA / The compact shape does suggest a rapid chemical processing and storage capacity.
 GEORDI / We found it close to the escape pod instrumentation assemblage... this capsule might process the ship's dynamic motions and augment the manual control inputs. (getting a little excited) We could send it a few test signals... make it think the entire assemblage was awake and operating.
 DATA / An intriguing experiment. The capsule might provide us with information without the need to decode the storage medium itself. Perhaps we could examine your theory immediately.
 WORF / (with usual Klingon intensity) Less talk, more synthehol. (beat) We came here to relax.
 GEORDI / I am relaxed. In fact, I've never felt better.
 GEORDI / But you know, Worf you do have a point. (to Data) I think the storage capsule can wait awhile.
 GEORDI / Hi. Not leaving, are you?
 GEORDI / Care for some company?
 GEORDI / (taking her arm) There are a lot of things you don't know about me.
 WORF / I have been tutoring him. (proudly) He learns quickly.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Medical Log, Stardate 43958.8. I have removed patient "John Doe" from the emergency bio-support unit. In just thirty-six hours most of his major organ systems have regenerated themselves to the point where they can now function on their own.
 BEVERLY / You certainly are.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 43960.6. Our mission to map the Zeta Gelis star cluster is proceeding on schedule. Meanwhile, Doctor Crusher reports that the recovery of the patient she has named John Doe continues at a remarkable pace.
 BEVERLY / Are you experiencing any discomfort?
 BEVERLY / (impressed) Your neurofibrowaves are functioning almost normally again. (beat) That puts you... about six weeks ahead of my original schedule.
 BEVERLY / You're all we've talked about since your arrival.
 BEVERLY / (light) You're right... I think it's time you stopped taking up valuable bedspace.
 BEVERLY / Now remember... you've been off your feet for almost a month. These motor assist bands will provide electrical stimulation to your arms and legs. They'll help you re-learn to control your muscles. (beat) Now, don't be disappointed if your mobility is restricted at first... your limbs are still weak.
 BEVERLY / Let's try again. But this time... a little more slowly.
 PICARD / And I envy your strength of will. Doctor Crusher has kept me informed of your progress. It's quite extraordinary.
 PICARD / Tell me John, are you still unable to recall anything at all about your past?
 PICARD / We're quite certain of that. But you have no idea how you came to be in that escape pod, or what happened to your ship?
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Have you tried synaptic induction?
 BEVERLY / His neural nets don't conform to any known patterns. Conventional neurotherapy has proven ineffective. Hopefully, in time, his memory pathways will reestablish themselves naturally.
 BEVERLY / That same pain again?
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Not a relapse I hope.
 BEVERLY / (concerned) This has nothing to do with his wounds. I think it's related to the continuing mutation of his cell structure.
 PICARD / Still no theory as to what's causing it?
 BEVERLY / (shaking her head) None. I've run every test I could think of... it just doesn't make any sense.
 GEORDI / I'll be there.
 RIKER / Miss Henshaw.
 RIKER / Bridge.
 GEORDI / Deck six.
 RIKER / (light, easy) So... you and Miss Henshaw have certainly been seeing a lot of each other.
 GEORDI / Every night this week.
 RIKER / Is that all? Seems like you've been walking around with a smile on your face for a lot longer than that.
 GEORDI / I guess I have. This last month or so... everything seems to be going my way. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (beat) I don't know what it is, but something's changed around here.
 RIKER / The only thing that's changed is you.
 GEORDI / Me? I'm the same guy I've always been.
 RIKER / If you say so... but I don't remember the old Geordi having much success with Christy Henshaw.
 GEORDI / Maybe I am a little more confident than I used to be.
 BEVERLY / What happened to you?
 BEVERLY / And now you've dislocated your shoulder. Sit down, I'll get the osteotractor frame.
 WESLEY / Hi mom. We still on for dinner tonight?
 BEVERLY / Seven-thirty sharp. I'll be right back.
 WESLEY / Kayaking again?
 WESLEY / So how's my mom's favorite patient?
 WESLEY / Hey... not bad.
 BEVERLY / (amazed) It's completely healed. I don't understand... what did you do, John?
 BEVERLY / I've run every test and scan that I can think of... there's no physiological evidence that would indicate he would possess such powers. But then, there's so much about John that's a mystery...
 WESLEY / You know... I really like him.
 BEVERLY / (pleased) He does have a certain charm doesn't he? The whole medical staff has commented on it.
 WESLEY / You seem pretty taken with him yourself.
 BEVERLY / I guess I am... taken with him. There's a strength and serenity about him that's very attractive. Yet, he's filled with such pain and turmoil... he's so vulnerable. I find him... very intriguing.
 WESLEY / (with a smile) Sounds like there's more to it than that.
 BEVERLY / Is that your way of asking if I'm getting romantically involved with him?
 WESLEY / You said it, I didn't.
 BEVERLY / My feelings toward him aren't romantic... exactly. I mean... I know that the... doctor_patient relationship can sometimes create a... false sense of intimacy... but this is different. There's an almost... spiritual connection. (beat) I guess I'm not making much sense, am I?
 WESLEY / (gently) I think I understand.
 GEORDI / Data, I was thinking about the storage capsule last night. (he places the capsule on to the console) And I was wondering... what if we've been going about it the wrong way. We've been trying to analyze its mechanical properties. What if it is a biochemical storage medium?
 DATA / Are you suggesting that it employes memory RNA like an organic cell?
 GEORDI / Well, it does contain quantities of nucleic acids.
 DATA / Perhaps the information sequences are encoded in the molecular patterns themselves.
 GEORDI / Computer, scan the storage capsule. Analyze molecular sequences on nucleic acid chains.
 GEORDI / (triumphant) Well what do you know. A navigational chart.
 DATA / It appears that your hypothesis was correct, Geordi.
 GEORDI / (very pleased) I knew it. (to Picard) Captain?
 PICARD / You found something?
 DATA / We have determined that the storage cube from John Doe's escape pod contains navigational information.
 PICARD / Can you match these stars to our charts?
 DATA / Computer, run transformational matrix calculations. Match navigational referents to known stars in this sector.
 GEORDI / (determined) I'm not giving up yet. Not after coming so close to cracking this thing. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (examines screen) That might be flight path information from John's ship, but without a frame of reference, I can't determine the origin points.
 DATA / Computer, assume those points are course corrections and derive gravitational values for stellar objects near the flight path.
 DATA / Most of these are ordinary G-type stars... (indicates point on screen) But this would appear to be a neutron star, possibly a pulsar.
 GEORDI / (indicates markings next to the pulsar) Which means this might be a rotational time reference.
 DATA / Computer, assume these symbols are pulsars. Translate associated values into standard temporal notations.
 DATA / (continuing) Computer, is there a pulsar with a rotational period of... one-point-five-two-four-four seconds within sensor range?
 GEORDI / Bingo! Overlay navigational chart using referenced pulsars and project a flight path back to origin.
 GEORDI / That's it, Captain. That's where John Doe came from.
 DATA / That bearing is almost directly along our planned course.
 PICARD / Good. Then we can continue our mission without significant interruption.
 PICARD / Yes... using the information we found in your escape pod, we may be able to return you to your people.
 PICARD / And why is that?
 BEVERLY / John, your memory... has it returned?
 PICARD / Escape what?
 BEVERLY / There were others with you?
 PICARD / We will not arrive in your star system for at least three weeks. That gives us plenty of time to discuss this matter further.
 BEVERLY / Hopefully by then, you'll have regained more of your memory.
 PICARD / It is... understandable.
 BEVERLY / We can see the rest of it some other time. This is your first day out of Sickbay... I don't want you to overexert yourself.
 BEVERLY / My thoughts exactly.
 BEVERLY / What is?
 BEVERLY / Is it that surprising?
 BEVERLY / You mean that energy pulse... ?
 BEVERLY / The pain... the energy pulse... they must all be linked to the cell mutation in your body. (beat) I wish there was some way I could help you get to the truth.
 BEVERLY / But you have...
 BEVERLY / The... friendship... that we've developed has made me... very happy.
 WORF / Sir, I am reading a vessel on long-range scanners... it is coming from sector nine five six nine.
 PICARD / What configuration?
 WORF / Impossible to identify at this distance. However, it is on an intercept course.
 DATA / Captain, the ship is traveling at warp nine point seven two.
 RIKER / Nine point seven two?
 PICARD / Time to intercept?
 DATA / At present course and speed... ten hours fifty-three minutes.
 PICARD / Try to hail them, Mister Worf.
 WORF / No response, Captain.
 PICARD / Monitor their approach... repeat hail every half hour.
 WORF / Aye sir.
 RIKER / Whoever they are, they're in a big hurry to get here.
 BEVERLY / (scanning him) John tell me... is it worse than before?
 BEVERLY / (reading tricorder) No. The readings are fluctuating too wildly... it wouldn't do any good, his entire cell structure... is transforming.
 BEVERLY / Where do you want to go?
 BEVERLY / John, that's impossible. In your condition---
 BEVERLY / Security...
 GEORDI / (to technicians) Okay, let's realign the magnetic inducers on the starboard nacelle.
 BEVERLY / John!
 WORF / Leave the control booth immediately!
 BEVERLY / John! Listen to me! You must come down!
 WORF / Step away from the controls.
 WORF / I have no wish to harm you... but you must return to Sickbay immediately.
 BEVERLY / His neck is broken. No life signs. (hits combadge) Sickbay, form a resuscitation team, we have a code seven in shuttle bay two. Transporter room, standby...
 BEVERLY / No... don't.
 BEVERLY / There's no trace of injury.
 PICARD / You admit you were trying to steal a shuttlecraft.
 PICARD / So I ask you again -- why?
 PICARD / Unacceptable. You had a reason -- I want to know what it was.
 PICARD (cont'd) / (sharply) Dammit, I'm entitled to an answer. You nearly killed a member of my crew.
 BEVERLY / (defending) And healed him.
 PICARD / I am not forgetting that. It's the only reason he's here, and not in the brig.
 PICARD / Why? Why is it dangerous? What is happening to you?
 BEVERLY / The rate of metamorphosis is accelerating. Almost as if your body were generating an electrical field that's warping the tissue. (in answer to Picard's look) I can't explain what I don't understand.
 PICARD / (frustrated and worried) Who are you? What are you?
 PICARD / As Lieutenant Worf discovered.
 BEVERLY / John, I can't believe you're capable of harming any --
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Captain, the alien vessel is coming within weapons range. Its shields are up.
 PICARD / On my way. (to Beverly and John) Take him back to Sickbay. I want him under constant surveillance.
 GEORDI / I want to thank you.
 GEORDI / I don't know how -- or why -- but down on the planet, you gave me something... a new confidence.
 DATA / Alien vessel approaching at half-impulse, heading zero-five-one mark one-one-four.
 PICARD / Raise shields. Slow to one-third impulse and bring us to one-zero-three mark zero-two-five. Mister Worf, hail the alien vessel.
 WORF / They continue to ignore our hails, sir.
 DATA / They are scanning us, Captain.
 WORF / They are answering our hail, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / You know him?
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of the United Federation of Planets. We intend no transgression of --
 PICARD / (re: John) Sunad -- this individual is our guest. We found him dying in a shipwreck and returned him to health.
 PICARD / Of what is he accused?
 PICARD / In what way?
 RIKER / Tactical analysis.
 WORF / The Zalkonian ship has a formidable armament. Their weaponry is comparable to ours.
 GEORDI / They're just as fast -- and probably just as maneuverable.
 PICARD / Counselor. Do they mean to carry out their threat?
 TROI / I believe so. Sunad's hatred for John was evident... but there's something else. The Zalkonians fear John.
 PICARD / Commander Riker, Counselor, Doctor. John, I'd like you to join us.
 PICARD (cont'd) / Mister Data, you have the Bridge. Mister Worf -- stay at Tactical. Counter any moves the Zalkonian makes.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / They make serious accusations against you...
 PICARD / You understand the difficult position in which I'm placed.
 PICARD / I'll inform you of my decision shortly.
 BEVERLY / Captain, you can't seriously be considering --
 PICARD / (sharply) We must consider all options, Doctor, without letting our personal feelings impede our judgment.
 BEVERLY / You're going to tell me it's irrelevant that we'd be sending him to his death...
 PICARD / Exactly. Whether we approve of the Zalkonians' motives is not at issue. (a beat) For what it's worth, I suspect John may be correct that his existence has broader ramifications than that of a simple criminal.
 TROI / Sunad thinks so. He feels personally threatened by John.
 BEVERLY / (agreeing) Sunad called John a "disruptive influence." That's hardly a capital offense --
 PICARD / It is not up to us to judge their laws, Doctor.
 RIKER / I know how I'd feel if the situation were reversed... if they were in our territory, holding a Federation citizen.
 TROI / (nods) The Zalkonians truly don't understand our indecision about returning John. In their eyes, we shouldn't be involved.
 BEVERLY / We are involved. I saved his life. For what? So they could chase him down and take that life away?
 PICARD / Commander, let me remind you we are on a mission of exploration... our purpose is to establish peaceful relations with the civilizations we encounter.
 PICARD / If that is your wish -- we will respect it.
 PICARD / Commander, we will leave. It is not our policy to intervene in the affairs of other cultures.
 PICARD (cont'd) / But before I return the survivor to you, I would appreciate a more detailed explanation of what he has done to merit a death sentence.
 PICARD / Agreed. However, there are circumstances of which you may be unaware. The survivor has suffered a memory loss -- he is, therefore, ill-equipped to defend himself against your accusations.
 PICARD / Since his recovery, he has manifested unusual abilities --
 PICARD / He apparently has the power to heal injuries with a simple touch...
 PICARD / -- and even to reverse death itself --
 WORF / Shields ineffective...
 BEVERLY / I can't... breathe...
 WORF / (reading his panel) Sunad is back aboard the Zalkonian vessel, Captain...
 PICARD / It is our mission to seek out life... in all its forms. We are privileged to have been present at the emergence of a new species.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43994.1. The Enterprise has arrived at Jouret Four in response to a distress signal from one of the Federation's outermost colonies.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Anything from the surface?
 WORF / Nossir. There have been no communications from the colony for over twelve hours.
 RIKER / Sensors picking up any signs of life?
 WORF / None.
 RIKER / (keying insignia) Mister O'Brien, verify these are accurate coordinates for New Providence colony.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43997.6. Admiral Hanson and Lieutenant Commander Shelby of Starfleet Tactical have arrived to review the disappearance of New Providence colony. No sign remains of the nine hundred inhabitants.
 RIKER / Then, you're convinced it is the Borg... ?
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Mister Riker wrote those reports... he agrees with you.
 RIKER / Obviously nothing we have now can stop them.
 PICARD / If this is the Borg, it would indicate they have a source of power far superior to our own...
 RIKER / It'll be night at the site in thirty minutes. We've scheduled an away team for dawn.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Why don't you show the commander to her quarters...
 RIKER / It's our poker night, Admiral. There's always an open seat for you...
 PICARD / You seem rather taken with her, J.P.
 PICARD / Earl Grey?
 PICARD / I already have a hell of a first officer.
 PICARD / One's available?
 PICARD / Well, I guess I knew this day would have to come... he'll make a fine captain, J.P.
 RIKER / (acknowledges) They identify what's useful to them, then consume it. Or try to at least...
 RIKER / A Borg footprint?
 RIKER / I've... already assigned them to the away team, Commander. And I'll be with you as well.
 RIKER / Every bit of it.
 RIKER / (beat) Job? Which job... ?
 RIKER / If I am... I'm sure you'll be the first to know, Commander. (beat) Poker's at seventeen hundred hours, my quarters, deck eight...
 DATA / I will buy another card, Counselor.
 WESLEY / Got another king in the hole, Data?
 DATA / I am afraid I cannot answer that Wesley. And as you are a newcomer to the game, may I say it is inappropriate to ask.
 TROI / No help there.
 GEORDI / (bad night) Fold. Again.
 WESLEY / I'm in.
 TROI / Three jacks looking back for the handsome young ensign.
 GEORDI / Beginner's luck.
 TROI / Pair of deuces stands.
 TROI / Possible flush, possible straight flush. The bet is yours, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / I'm in for ten...
 RIKER / (to Wesley) Time to put on the long pants, Wes. I'll see your ten. And raise you a hundred.
 GEORDI / He's got the straight flush.
 DATA / Not necessarily. Commander Riker may be bluffing, Wesley.
 WESLEY / I don't think so. I fold.
 GEORDI / (groans) With three jacks? (shakes his head) Wesley, you may get straight A's in school, but you've still got a little to learn about poker...
 GEORDI / (delighted) You got him!
 RIKER / Mister Data and our guest appear to be tardy...
 RIKER / (reacts, angry) On whose authority?
 RIKER / (interrupting, burning) Commander Shelby... (he pauses, will not do this in front of the other officers) Walk with me, Commander.
 DATA / I believe Commander Shelby erred... there are no known avifaunal or crawling vermicular lifeforms on Jouret Four.
 GEORDI / That's... not what she meant, Data... but, uh, you're right, she erred...
 RIKER / So without any regard to the risk of coming down alone...
 RIKER / My problem, Commander, is I expect to be notified before there's a change in my orders...
 RIKER / Go ahead.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 43998.5. With confirmation of the Borg's presence in Federation space, Admiral Hanson has returned to Starbase three two four to discuss strategy with Starfleet Command. Lieutenant Commander Shelby remains on board to continue tactical preparations.
 RIKER / ... a standing Yellow Alert... all Federation and allied outposts have been warned... Ops will continue to monitor long range sensors... I've assigned Data, La Forge and Mister Crusher to work with Commander Shelby.
 PICARD / Very good, Number One. You've covered all the bases. As usual. (beat) What's your impression of Shelby?
 RIKER / She knows her stuff, Captain.
 PICARD / She has your full confidence...
 RIKER / Well, I think she needs... supervision. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / She takes the initiative a little too... easily. Sometimes with risks.
 PICARD / Sounds a little like a young lieutenant commander I once recruited as my first officer.
 RIKER / (returns smile) Perhaps.
 PICARD / You're the best officer I've ever served with, Will.
 PICARD / (most gentle) But what are you still doing here?
 RIKER / (reacts) Sir?
 PICARD / I hear you've been offered the Melbourne.
 RIKER / I've decided not to pursue the commission at this time.
 PICARD / She's a fine ship, Will.
 RIKER / She's not the Enterprise. (beat) With all due respect, sir, you need me. Particularly now.
 PICARD / Starfleet needs good captains. Particularly now. I cannot keep you to myself forever.
 PICARD / I want you to reconsider your decision.
 RIKER / (reacts) Are you asking me to leave, Captain?
 PICARD / I'm asking you to look at your career objectively and make the best decision. (beat) I know it's hard to walk away. But you're ready to work without a net, my friend. You're ready to make the life and death decisions a captain must make. And, hard as it is to accept, if you choose to leave, the Enterprise will go on just fine without you.
 RIKER / What am I still doing here, Deanna? I've pushed myself hard to get this far... (glancing at her) ... sacrificed a lot. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / I've always said I wanted my own command. And yet something's holding me back. Is it wrong to want to stay... ?
 TROI / What do you think?
 RIKER / (shakes his head, doesn't know) Maybe I'm just afraid of the big chair.
 TROI / I don't think so.
 RIKER / (unconvinced) The captain says Shelby reminds him of the way I used to be. And he's right. She comes in here, full of drive and ambition, impatient, taking risks... I look at her and I wonder whatever happened to those things in me? I I liked those things in me. (shakes his head) I've lost something.
 TROI / (suppressing a smile) You mean you're older, more experienced... a little more seasoned...
 RIKER / (grins) "Seasoned". What a horrible thing to say to a man.
 TROI / I don't think you've lost a thing... and you've gained a lot more than you realize. You're much more comfortable with yourself than you used to be...
 RIKER / Maybe that's the problem. Could be I'm too comfortable here.
 TROI / I'm not sure I know what that means. (But I do know that.. ) You're happy here... happier than I've ever known you to be. It really comes down to a simple question -- what do you want, Will Riker?
 TROI / What?
 RIKER / Stupid. An old song I heard when I was a kid. Keeps running through my mind... (off her look, he begins to sing) "Didja ever have the feeling that you wanted to go... still had the feeling that you wanted to stay... You knew it was right... wasn't wrong... still you knew you wouldn't be very long... it's tough to have the feeling that you wanted to go... "
 RIKER / (continuing) "... still had the feeling that you wanted to stay... start to go... change your mind... "
 RIKER / I play the trombone too...
 GEORDI / Might indicate high-output auxiliary generators kicking in.
 DATA / It is a reasonable conclusion. Borg technology has given each member of their society the ability to interface and function collectively. It is likely they would construct their ship with the same philosophy.
 WESLEY / (shakes his head) Knock out one generator and another takes over without interruption.
 RIKER / What kind of damage would we have to do to shut them down... ?
 WESLEY / (grim) And our best shot barely scratched the surface.
 GEORDI / From what I've seen, I can't believe any of your new weapons systems can be ready in less than eighteen months, Commander.
 RIKER / (looking at the designs) Is there anything here we can try to adapt to our current defense systems... ?
 GEORDI / (studying them intently) We'll have to look through the specs again. (sighs, tired) I don't know. My mind's turned to clay.
 WESLEY / Mine too.
 RIKER / Commander, I think we should call it a night.
 WESLEY / No, that's okay...
 GEORDI / Go ahead, Commander...
 RIKER / We'll break here. That's an order. We'll reconvene at oh five hundred...
 RIKER / You need rest, Commander.
 RIKER / If we have a confrontation, I don't want a crew fighting the Borg at the same time they're fighting their own fatigue... Dismissed.
 PICARD / How long to get there at warp nine, Mister Data?
 DATA / One hour, seventeen minutes, sir.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 PICARD / (dry) We'll try to occupy them pending your arrival, Admiral.
 RIKER / All hands will stand to battle stations...
 PICARD / Commander Shelby, status of defense preparations?
 GEORDI / At the same time, we're retuning phasers to higher EM-base emitting frequencies -- we'll try to disrupt their subspace field.
 PICARD / Your assessment of our potential effectiveness?
 GEORDI / Shot in the dark, Captain. Best we can do for now.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Dismissed.
 WORF / Sir, reading an unidentified vessel just entering sensor range, bearing two-one-zero mark one-five-one...
 PICARD / Hail them, Mister Worf...
 WORF / No response, sir...
 PICARD / Move to intercept.
 WORF / (beat, reacting to console) Sir, the vessel has already changed course to intercept us. Approaching at... warp nine point three... Entering visual range...
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson -- we have engaged the Borg.
 WORF / Captain, you are being hailed.
 PICARD / I am?
 WORF / Yes, Captain. By name.
 RIKER / Data, is it the same ship we faced at J-two-five?
 DATA / Uncertain, Commander. However, dimensions are precisely the same.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc...
 PICARD / You have committed acts of aggression against the United Federation of Planets. If you do not immediately withdraw...
 RIKER / (to Picard) What the hell could they want with you?
 PICARD / Their priorities seem to have changed. Open channel. (to the viewscreen) We have developed new defense capabilities since our last meeting and we are prepared to use them if you do not withdraw from Federation space. If you do so immediately, I will agree to arrange a conference of our peoples at a neutral location.
 GEORDI / (to comm) Shields are being probed... I'm modulating nutation...
 WORF / Sir, the Borg are attempting to lock on to us with their tractor beam...
 PICARD / Load all torpedo bays... ready phasers... target coordinates on the source of the tractor beam...
 RIKER / Status of shields...
 DATA / Holding...
 RIKER / (cautious) They have the ability to analyze and adapt, Commander...
 GEORDI / Shield modulation has failed... they've locked on...
 WORF / Shields are being drained... ninety per cent... eighty...
 GEORDI / Trying to recalibrate nutation... damn...
 WORF / Shields have failed.
 PICARD / Fire all weapons...
 GEORDI / Their subspace field is intact... new phaser frequencies had no impact...
 RIKER / Reverse engines...
 GEORDI / Full reverse... we're not moving...
 PICARD / Fire at will...
 WORF / Launching torpedos... phaser spread continuing...
 DATA / Still no damage to the Borg vessel, sir...
 WORF / They're cutting into the hull... Engineering section...
 RIKER / Geordi... evacuate Engineering...
 GEORDI / Computer. Evacuation sequence...
 GEORDI / Move it people!
 WORF / The tractor beam has been released.
 PICARD / Warp nine. Course one-five-one mark three-three-zero... engage...
 WORF / They are in pursuit, Captain.
 PICARD / Maintain course.
 RIKER / Damage report, Geordi.
 GEORDI / (still in shock) Hull rupture in Main Engineering... damage is heavy... (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / We lost a lot of good people down there.
 DATA / Eleven dead... eight more unaccounted for, Captain.
 RIKER / (to com) Repair teams to Engineering... seal hull breach...
 GEORDI / They didn't get to the core... I can control functions from here...
 WESLEY / Approaching the Paulson Nebula, sir...
 PICARD / Drop to impulse... take us in, Ensign...
 WESLEY / The field is getting too dense, sir...
 PICARD / Steady... Mister Data, analysis of the nebula cloud...
 DATA / Eighty-two percent Dilithium hydroxyls... manganese, chromium. It should provide an effective screen against their sensors, sir...
 PICARD / Prepare to take us in, Mister Crusher. Now. Mister La Forge, prepare to reverse engines, full stop.
 WORF / The Borg ship is continuing scans... attempting to locate us...
 PICARD / Good. As long as they're looking for us... they can't hurt anyone else.
 RIKER / Shut down all active sensors, passive scanners only. Deflectors to minimum emissions.
 PICARD / We'll maintain position. (looks at Riker and Shelby) Until we have a better idea.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / There's a two percent power drop, just for an instant... but it's system-wide... The phaser frequency spread was in a high narrow band.
 DATA / Conceivably, the ship's power distribution nodes are vulnerable to those frequencies.
 GEORDI / If we can generate a concentrated burst of energy with that same frequency distribution... I mean a lot more than anything our phasers or photon torpedos could provide...
 RIKER / How do we do that?
 WESLEY / The main deflector dish.
 GEORDI / It's the only component of the Enterprise designed to channel that much power at controlled frequencies.
 RIKER / (muses) But if we could get far enough away... increase the deflector range...
 RIKER / (acknowledges) Proceed. I'll inform the Captain...
 RIKER / (shakes his head) We may need power from the saucer impulse engines...
 RIKER / (beat) No, it's too great a risk...
 RIKER / (cool) I bring all alternatives to the captain's attention, Commander. (dismissing them) That'll be all.
 GEORDI / I'll need to install higher-capacity power transfers to the deflector dish, Commander...
 RIKER / How long...
 GEORDI / Better part of a day.
 RIKER / She gets a full head of steam up, doesn't she...
 GEORDI / Yessir... she's... a formidable presence to say the least. But I'm convinced she can help us here, Commander...
 RIKER / I am too, Geordi. Don't worry about it. I can handle Shelby.
 PICARD'S VOICE / Come.
 PICARD / Come in, Number One... Commander Shelby was just telling me of your concerns about her plan...
 RIKER / I'm sorry that she troubled you, sir... I already informed her...
 PICARD / Yes, I entirely agree with you. It's not the time. But I am afraid the time may eventually come when greater risks are required. I'd like you to consider her plan as a fall-back position and make the necessary preparations.
 RIKER / Very good, sir.
 RIKER / (to comm) Halt. (to Shelby) You and I have to talk, Commander.
 RIKER / You disagree with me, fine. You want to take it to the captain, fine. Through me. You do an end run around me again, I'll snap you back so hard, you'll think you're a first year cadet again.
 RIKER / By all means.
 RIKER / Really? How terrible for you.
 RIKER / When it comes to this ship, to this crew, you're damned right I'll play it safe.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise remains concealed in the dust cloud. And to my surprise, the Borg have maintained their position, waiting for us to come out of hiding. I have no explanation for their special interest in me or this ship.
 PICARD (V.O.) / We continue to prepare our defenses for the inevitable confrontation. But, I must admit, on this night I contemplate the distinct possibility that no defense may be adequate against this enemy...
 PICARD / Something of a tradition, Guinan... touring the ship before a battle...
 PICARD / Not necessarily. Nelson toured the HMS Victory before Trafalgar...
 PICARD / No, but the battle was won.
 PICARD / We may yet prevail. It is a conceit but a healthy one. (beat) I wonder if the Emperor Honorious watching the Visigoths coming over the seventh hill could truly realize that the Roman Empire was about to fall. This is really just another page of history, isn't it? Will this be the end of our civilization? (shrugs) ... Turn the page.
 PICARD / You say that with remarkable assuredness.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard, report to the bridge.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) On my way, Lieutenant.
 RIKER / They're some kind of magnetometric-guided charges.
 PICARD / Status of shields.
 WORF / Back to forty-eight percent, Captain.
 PICARD / (to comm) Mister La Forge, I may have to take us out of the nebula... I'll need all the power you can give me.
 GEORDI / Engines are ready, Captain. Recommend you adjust shield harmonics to favor the upper EM band when you proceed...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 WORF / Direct hit... deck nine...
 RIKER / Damage report...
 WORF / Structural latching system integrity breached...
 PICARD / Take us out of here, Number One...
 RIKER / Fire up the engines... half impulse until we clear the nebula... then punch it to warp nine.
 PICARD / Ready phasers... load forward torpedo bays...
 RIKER / Engage.
 WORF / Borg tractor beam is attempting to lock on...
 PICARD / Fire at will. Continue rotating shield frequ...
 WORF / Shields are failing...
 WORF / Tractor beam has locked on.
 RIKER / They're holding us...
 RIKER / It's no use... they've already adapted to the new frequencies...
 WORF / The Borg ship is disengaging... leaving at warp speed...
 RIKER / (to conn) Maintain pursuit...
 WORF / Borg vessel has reached warp nine... nine-point-four... nine-point-six...
 RIKER / Stay with them. (to comm) Riker to O'Brien. Can you get a fix on the captain?
 RIKER / Senior officers report to the bridge.
 WORF / Sir, the coordinates they've set... they're on a direct course... to sector zero-zero-one. The Terran system.
 RIKER / (reacts) Earth.
 PICARD / I have nothing to say to you, and I will resist you with my last ounce of strength.
 PICARD / Impossible. My culture is based on freedom and self-determination.
 PICARD / We would rather die.
 PICARD / What is it you wish of me?
 WORF / They're leading us into the heart of our own defenses...
 GEORDI / So far, they haven't had any reason to worry about our defenses...
 WESLEY / Commander, if the Borg stay at warp nine-point-six, we'll be forced to discontinue pursuit and power down in less than three hours.
 DATA / Two hours, forty minutes and three seconds.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) How soon before the deflector is ready?
 GEORDI / We're close. Few hours maybe... (before Riker has to tell him) I know I'll get it done in two... somehow... but Commander, I need serious power from the warp engines to make this weapon work. We're using all we've got just to keep up with them...
 RIKER / I'm leading an away team over there to get the captain back. We'll find a way to bring them out of warp... (orders) Ensign Crusher... continue to assist Mister La Forge... Commander Shelby, you will take the bridge and coordinate with Starfleet... Data, Worf, Doctor Crusher, you're with me...
 RIKER / (not now) Those are my orders, Commander.
 TROI / Commander Riker... (beat) It is inappropriate for you to lead the away team. Until the return of Captain Picard, you are in command of the Enterprise. We are in a state of war. Your place is on the bridge.
 RIKER / (softer) Commander Shelby, you will lead the away team.
 RIKER / Make it so.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, supplemental. Our pursuit of the Borg continues at high warp on a course that will take us to the very core of the Federation. The devastation they could bring is beyond imagination.
 WORF / These phasers have been retuned. Each has a different frequency spanning the upper EM band.
 BEVERLY / What kind of resistance can we expect?
 DATA / At our last encounter, the Borg virtually ignored us when we beamed aboard their vessel, Doctor. They clearly did not consider our being there a threat.
 RIKER / (to com) We've got fifty-eight minutes before we have to power down and disengage.
 RIKER / Proceed. (quick) Commander, no unnecessary risks. If it becomes clear you can't succeed, I want you back here, alive... I don't want any dead heroes. Clear?
 WORF / (checking tricorder) Tricorder functions are minimal.
 WORF / Inconclusive.
 BEVERLY / (awe) Look at this... this is extraordinary.
 DATA / (acknowledges) These appear to be some kind of power waveguide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions.
 DATA / (agreeing) The decentralized power system makes it virtually impossible.
 BEVERLY / (studying the configuration) What about looking at it... from the mosquito's point of view.
 DATA / (puzzled) An interesting metaphor, Doctor. What is your idea?
 BEVERLY / If we sting them in a tender spot... at least we might get them to stop a minute to scratch.
 DATA / Distribution nodes.
 WORF / The captain's communicator... it is still activated.
 BEVERLY / (keying insignia) Crusher to Picard, can you hear me, Captain...
 WORF / (checking) This way...
 RIKER / I strongly recommend redeploying all available defenses to protect sector zero-zero-one, Admiral...
 RIKER / Twenty-two minutes if they stay at current speed. If we can't bring them out of warp, we'll do as much damage as we can before we have to disengage.
 RIKER / Nothing yet, sir.
 WORF / In here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 RIKER / (to com) Stand by, Commander.
 WESLEY / We're in business.
 GEORDI / It'll burn out the main deflector... but it'll be one hell of a bang.
 RIKER / Radiation danger?
 WESLEY / We'll need to evacuate the entire forward half of the secondary hull. And the lower three decks of the saucer.
 TROI / I'll see to that.
 RIKER / (to com) Commander Shelby... we have only seventeen minutes of warp power left. Do what you can to get them out of warp.
 WORF / Wait! Look --
 WORF / Captain!
 WESLEY / Sir, they did it... the Borg ship is dropping out of warp...
 RIKER / Go to impulse.
 GEORDI / Diverting warp energy to main deflector...
 RIKER / Move us to within forty thousand kilometers, match velocity. Commence arming sequence... Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band...
 RIKER / The captain?
 DATA / Sir, Captain Picard has been altered by the Borg. We were unable to retrieve him...
 RIKER / Altered... ?
 WORF / He is a Borg, sir.
 GEORDI / Commander, reading subspace field fluctuations within the Borg ship. Looks like they're regenerating... restoring power. They could be capable of warp any minute.
 RIKER / Is the deflector ready?
 GEORDI / (registering import of the pending decision) Ready, sir.
 BEVERLY / Will, he's alive... if we get him back, I might be able to restore...
 RIKER / This is our only chance to destroy them... if they get back into warp, our weapon becomes useless.
 RIKER / (shakes his head) We can't maintain pursuit. We don't have the power. (beat) Prepare to fire.
 RIKER / Belay that order, Lieutenant. There's no time...
 WORF / Sir, we are being hailed by the Borg...
 RIKER / On screen.
 PICARD_BORG / I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you will service... us.
 RIKER / Mister Worf... fire.
 RIKER / 
 GEORDI / 
 GEORDI / Deflector power approaching maximum limits. Energy discharge in... six seconds...
 WORF / The Borg ship is undamaged.
 GEORDI / Can't maintain it much longer, Commander...
 RIKER / Cease fire.
 GEORDI / Shutting down warp engines.
 RIKER / (unbelievable) They couldn't have adapted that quickly...
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's Log, Stardate 43999.1. The Borg ship has resumed its course toward Earth. We are unable to pursue pending repairs to the Enterprise.
 RIKER / ... and as we anticipated, the blast burned out the main navigational deflector... we also have damage to shields and the reactor core.
 GEORDI / We should be back up in eight to twelve hours, Admiral.
 RIKER / The Enterprise will be there, sir. Maybe a little late. But we'll be there.
 BEVERLY / Then... we have abandoned all hope of recovering him.
 RIKER / Good luck, Admiral.
 RIKER / Come.
 RIKER / Hi.
 TROI / You wanted to see me?
 RIKER / How's the crew?
 TROI / Throwing themselves into the work to be done... the emotional impact hasn't been fully realized yet...
 RIKER / (understands) I guess Starfleet training kicks in and takes over...
 TROI / (acknowledges) We know the risks, tell ourselves we're prepared for the consequences... and yet, something like this cuts deeper than we can admit at first. He was our Captain. It's like losing the leader of a nation or the head of a family.
 RIKER / (a beat) He was more of a father to me than my own.
 RIKER / When I saw him like that... mutilated...
 TROI / You did what you had to do... nobody doubts your love for him...
 RIKER / Was there any part of him left, Deanna?
 TROI / (slow) Yes. I can still sense his humanity
 RIKER / (looks down) Then you must have sensed his pain...
 RIKER / I don't envy your abilities.
 RIKER / I'd better check on the progress of our repairs... (beat) There won't be any changes... as far as I'm concerned it's his ship, his crew... and everything we do, every battle we fight, it's for him. (beat, warm) I'm glad you're here to help me with this.
 TROI / Thank you, Captain.
 RIKER / (dismissed) Counselor...
 RIKER / ... and Mister Crusher has suggested a chip might be designed that will automatically retune phasers to a random setting after each discharge...
 WORF / That would be a great advantage.
 RIKER / We should also see if we can find some way to neutralize their forcefields, Worf... we've got to show them we can adapt too. (to com) Engineering. (continuing to Worf) We're not just fighting the Borg anymore... we're fighting the life experience they've stolen from Captain Picard... how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves... ?
 WORF / The Borg have neither honor nor courage... that is our greatest advantage.
 RIKER / I hope it's enough.
 GEORDI / Engine control processors are back up...
 GEORDI / Forward shields at fifty-eight percent... aft shields -- (reacts as he studies sensors) Sensors must be down...
 GEORDI / Just the man I need. (to Riker) We're having problems with the aft shields... generators are going on and off line... I could use your help, Worf...
 RIKER / How soon do we get underway, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Still a couple hours... Commander Shelby can fill you in...
 RIKER / The warp reactor core?
 RIKER / Good.
 RIKER / Yes. You did a good job on the Borg ship.
 RIKER / You stopped them. You gave us our shot.
 RIKER / Commander, we don't have to like each other to work well together. In fact, I expect you to continue to keep me on my toes.
 RIKER / Damn, you are ambitious, aren't you, Shelby...
 RIKER / You also have a lot to learn, Commander.
 RIKER / (beat) Almost as much as I had to learn when I came aboard as Captain Picard's first officer. He reminded me of that fact when I commented on what a pain in the neck you are.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to Riker. Message from Starfleet, Captain.
 RIKER / Go ahead, Data.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Starfleet reports it has engaged the Borg at Wolf 359.
 DATA / Admiral Hanson on subspace, Captain...
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / Admiral...
 RIKER (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44000.3. Repairs are complete. The Enterprise is warping to rendezvous with Starfleet at Wolf 359. Subspace communications from the site of battle have been cut off possibly by Borg interference.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Worf, everyone at this table shares my respect for your service to this ship. But right now, I need your experience at tactical... Mister Data, I realize that your very nature omits ambition. Nevertheless, I want you to know I thought seriously about you as first officer as well...
 DATA / Thank you, sir...
 RIKER / But this is not a time for change. I need you all where you are, where Captain Picard always relied on you. (with some tongue-in-cheek) I have been... reluctantly... forced to conclude that Commander Shelby, our expert on the Borg, is the ideal choice at this time for first officer.
 RIKER / Based on our last communication, we have to assume the Borg have survived the fleet's attack... your thoughts on our next encounter...
 GEORDI / I've gone over it four times... The local field distortion just wouldn't be strong enough to incapacitate them...
 DATA / Doctor Crusher and I have been working on an interesting premise...
 BEVERLY / With our recent experience in nanotechnology, we might be able to introduce a destructive breed of nanite to the Borg...
 DATA / Robots small enough to enter living cells.
 RIKER / How much time would it take to execute this...
 BEVERLY / That's the problem. Two, three weeks.
 TROI / In two or three weeks, nanites may be all that's left of the Federation.
 WORF / We have the new phaser adapters...
 GEORDI / (grim) Perhaps in concert with photon torpedoes... we can slow them down...
 RIKER / I'm sure Captain Picard would have something meaningful and inspiring to say right now. And to tell you the truth, I wish he were here to say it, cause I'd like to hear it, too.
 RIKER (O.C.) / (continuing) I know how difficult this transition is for all of you. I can take over for him, but I can never replace Captain Picard and would never hope to...
 RIKER / (a beat) Whatever the outcome, I know our efforts in the coming battle will justify the faith he had in all of us. (beat, bailing out) Dismissed.
 RIKER / What would you do?
 RIKER / Come in.
 RIKER / (reluctant) Well, actually Guinan... right now, I...
 RIKER / What's on your mind?
 RIKER / (defensive) I'm not sure anyone can.
 RIKER / (with an edge) I'll do the best I can.
 RIKER / (calmly angry) Maybe you didn't hear -- yesterday, I tried to kill him.
 RIKER / No.
 RIKER / It's not that simple... This was his crew... he wrote the book on this ship...
 RIKER / Yes...
 WESLEY / (on com) Captain, we're approaching the Wolf system.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / On my way.
 RIKER / Slow to impulse. Take us to the battle coordinates, Ensign... yellow alert...
 WORF / Sensors are picking up several vessels, Captain...
 RIKER / The fleet?
 DATA / (checking) There are no active subspace fields... Negligible power readings...
 RIKER / Lifesigns?
 DATA / Negative, sir.
 WORF / Visual contact.
 RIKER / On screen.
 WORF / Sir, sensors are picking up unusually strong magnetic eddy currents, bearing two-zero-zero, mark two-one-one.
 RIKER / Data, your analysis...
 DATA / It could indicate the course of the Borg ship...
 RIKER / Ensign Crusher, set a course that follows those currents...
 WESLEY / Aye, Captain.
 RIKER / Commander Shelby, you will prepare to initiate your plan of separating the saucer section when we find the Borg.
 RIKER / I'm aware of that, Commander. In fact, I'm counting on it.
 RIKER / Mister Data and Mister Worf, I have a special mission for you...
 RIKER'S VOICE / Locutus of Borg, this is Captain William T. Riker of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
 RIKER / We wish to end the hostilities.
 RIKER / We are prepared to meet to discuss your terms.
 RIKER / Come now, Locutus, if Picard's knowledge and experience is part of you, then you know I have never lied to him... in fact, you should implicitly trust me, is that not so?
 RIKER / Then trust me now. Meet with me to discuss terms.
 RIKER / Mister Gleason, can you pinpoint the Borg's source of transmission?
 RIKER / (to comm) Mister O'Brien, report...
 RIKER / (to comm) As expected. Mister Data and Mister Worf, you will proceed as we discussed...
 DATA / Aye, Captain...
 RIKER / We would like time to prepare our people for assimilation.
 RIKER / Does it involve a lot of needles... because I just hate needles...
 RIKER / Take your best shot, Locutus, cause we're about to intervene.
 RIKER / Reset subspace communications to scrambler code Riker One...
 RIKER / (to com) Commander Shelby, report...
 RIKER / Make it so.
 GEORDI / Docking latches clear, separation complete...
 WESLEY / Saucer velocity one hundred meters per second and increasing.
 RIKER / Open fire... all weapons...
 WESLEY / Borg tractor beam attempting to lock on, Captain...
 RIKER / Evasive manuevers... pattern Riker Alpha...
 WESLEY / Riker Alpha, confirmed...
 WESLEY / They're ignoring the saucer section completely...
 RIKER / (murmering toward the Borg ship) Just as you should, Captain... Ensign, evasive pattern, Riker Beta...
 WESLEY / Riker Beta, confirmed...
 RIKER / (to comm) Commander Shelby, proceed with second phase...
 RIKER / Launch shuttle...
 DATA / Shuttle launch sequence confirmed... departing Enterprise in three seconds...
 WESLEY / The Borg tractor beam has moved toward the anti-matter spread.
 RIKER / (to com) Data, cut your engines... take her in unpowered...
 WESLEY / They're gonna make it...
 WORF / Shuttle has penetrated the Borg electromagnetic field...
 DATA / (checking sensors) The shuttle escape transporter should provide adequate power to beam us onto the Borg ship from here, sir...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / And back, Mister Data?
 DATA / Yessir, there should be enough energy for two transports.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Proceed.
 WORF / Mission accomplished... we have him...
 DATA / Firing shuttle thrusters...
 RIKER / Beam them out of there, Mister O'Brien...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, we've sustained damage to the impulse drive... the saucer section is disabled...
 RIKER / Stand-by, La Forge...
 WESLEY / (to himself) The saucer section... it's a sitting duck...
 RIKER / Prepare to draw their fire...
 WESLEY / (surprised) Captain, the Borg ship... it's moving away...
 WESLEY / It's resuming its course to Earth, sir...
 RIKER / Rendezvous with the saucer section... lay in a course of pursuit...
 BEVERLY / There's extensive infiltration of microcircuit fibers into the surrounding tissues... his DNA is being rewritten...
 RIKER / Can you revive him?
 BEVERLY / (reluctant) I'd like more time to study the structural changes in the motor pathways...
 RIKER / Doctor, we don't have more time. Once he was wired into the Borg, they knew everything he knew. I'm hoping it goes both ways. If we're lucky, he had access to everything we need to know about them... especially their vulnerabilities.
 BEVERLY / Jean Luc... it's Beverly... can you hear me...
 BEVERLY / Yes... don't try to move...
 RIKER / That's right.
 RIKER / Locutus...
 BEVERLY / (to comm) Security...
 DATA / Using multimodal reflection sorting, I have been able to detect a complex series of subspace signals between Locutus and the Borg ship...
 BEVERLY / That's how they're controlling him?
 DATA / It is not just a matter of control, Doctor. The signals are interactive across a subspace domain similar to that of a Transporter beam. I would hypothesize that these frequencies form the basis of the Borg's collective consciousness.
 RIKER / Can't we block them?
 DATA / Possibly. But, as you will recall, on several occasions, we have witnessed the Borg removing key circuits from injured comrades... no doubt separating them from the group consciousness.
 RIKER / The injured Borg immediately self-destructed.
 DATA / That is correct, sir.
 BEVERLY / Cutting the link to Locutus might be fatal to Captain Picard.
 RIKER / We have to find a way to reach him... we must know what he knows...
 BEVERLY / Without these interactive signals, it would only be a matter of microsurgery... I could do it... but as long as those Borg implants are functioning, there's no way I can separate the man from the machine.
 DATA / (beat, an idea) Then perhaps... there is a way I can access the 'machine', Doctor.
 WORF / The Klingon Empire will never yield.
 WORF / I like my species the way it is.
 RIKER / (to Security men) Take him to Data's lab...
 RIKER / Go ahead...
 RIKER / Planetary defenses?
 RIKER / (interrupting) Mister Crusher, at their current speed, when will they reach Earth?
 WESLEY / Twenty-seven minutes...
 RIKER / The soonest we can intercept?
 WESLEY / (beat, grim) Forty-two minutes, sir.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to Data... your status?
 DATA / The initial cybernetic connection into Captain Picard's neural net pathways has been established... Mister O'Brien is ready to process the Borg signal through the transport pattern buffer.
 RIKER / Make it so. And with dispatch, Mister Data...
 DATA / Proceeding immediately, sir. Data out.
 DATA / The neural link will be established in three stages... Doctor, I suggest you closely observe Captain Picard's lifesigns while Chief O'Brien monitors my positronic matrix activity at each stage... Counselor, hopefully you will be able to determine if I am reaching Captain Picard.
 DATA / I do not know. I have never done this before. (touching a series of panels) Initating first neural link...
 BEVERLY / The Captain's vital signs are stable...
 DATA / First neural connection is confirmed... I cannot report any significant access to the Borg consciousness...
 WORF / It is confirmed... the Borg have broken through the Mars defense perimeter...
 WESLEY / Enterprise approaching the Terran system, sir...
 RIKER / Slow to impulse... time to intercept...
 WESLEY / Twenty-three minutes, fourteen seconds, sir.
 DATA / Second neural connection is confirmed... I still cannot report any significant access... proceeding with the final link...
 BEVERLY / Significant increase in premotor area and hypothalamus activity... his heartrate is accelerating rapidly...
 DATA / Neural connections are complete. I... have... access to the Borg subspace signals... Processing... processing...
 TROI / Data...
 DATA / Stand by... processing...
 DATA / Fascinating. The Borg group consciousness... is divided into subcommands... necessary to carry out all functions... communications, defense, navigation... they are all controlled... by a root command... implanted in each -- Suddenly...
 BEVERLY / Data, I'm picking up increased neural activity in Captain Picard... localized in the prefrontal and parietal lobes...
 DATA / Negative... subspace signal configuration is unchanged. The cause of increased neural activity is unclear...
 TROI / No, it's not... it's him...
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Troi to Bridge. Data has made first contact with Captain Picard...
 RIKER / Can you communicate with him, Data?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / I have been unable to create a neural path around the Borg implants, sir... it is Captain Picard himself who has somehow managed to initiate contact...
 WORF / Sir, the Borg have halted their approach to Earth...
 RIKER / Time to intercept... ?
 WESLEY / Two minutes, four seconds...
 RIKER / They're worried... they're worried that we've got access to Picard... we've got two minutes to figure out what we can do with it...
 DATA / Sir, it is clear the Borg are unable or unwilling to terminate their subspace links...
 BEVERLY / That may be their achilles heel, Captain... their interdependency...
 RIKER / What do you mean, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / He's part of their collective consciousness... Cutting him off is like asking us to disconnect an arm or a foot... we can't do it.
 RIKER / If one jumps off the cliff... they all jump off the cliff... (to com) Data, is it possible to plant a command in the Borg collective consciousness...
 DATA / It is conceivable, sir... it would require altering the pathways from the root command, to affect all iterative branchpoints in...
 RIKER / (interrupting) Make every effort, Mister Data...
 DATA / What command shall I try to plant, sir... ?
 RIKER / Something straightforward... like 'disarm your weapons systems'...
 WORF / Visual contact with the Borg...
 RIKER / Magnify.
 WORF / Sensors reading increased power generation from the Borg...
 RIKER / Red alert. Load all torpedo bays... ready phasers...
 WORF / Aye, Captain...
 RIKER / Status of the Borg weapons...
 WORF / Borg weapon systems are fully charged...
 RIKER / Data... ?
 DATA / Attempting to reroute subcommand paths, Captain... defense systems are protected by access barriers...
 WORF / Borg attempting to lock on tractor beam...
 RIKER / Rotate shield frequencies... (to com) Data, report...
 DATA / I am unable to penetrate defense systems command structure, Captain...
 DATA / Acknowledged... attempting new power subcommand path...
 GEORDI / Shields have failed...
 RIKER / Fire all weapons.
 DATA / I cannot penetrate the Borg power subcommand structure... all critical subcommands are protected, Captain...
 RIKER / Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship...
 RIKER / (quietly) You heard me. A collision course.
 WESLEY / Yessir.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, prepare to go to warp power...
 PICARD / Sleep.
 BEVERLY / Data, he's regaining consciousness...
 PICARD / Sleep.
 TROI / (reacts) It is Captain Picard speaking, not Locutus.
 PICARD / Sleep. Data.
 BEVERLY / He's exhausted.
 DATA / Yes, Doctor... but if I may make a supposition, I believe his message was not intended to express fatigue but to suggest a course of action.
 WORF / Borg cutting beam activated...
 RIKER / Mister Crusher, en...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to Bridge... stand by...
 RIKER / Stand by all stations...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / I am attempting to penetrate the Borg regenerative subcommand path... it is a low priority system and may be accessible...
 WORF / Sir... shall I execute evacuation sequence...
 RIKER / Negative, Mister Worf... Mister Data, your final report...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Stand by...
 RIKER / I can't, Mister Data...
 RIKER / Data? What the hell happened?
 DATA / I successfully planted a command in the Borg collective consciousness, sir. It misdirected them to believe it was time to regenerate. In effect, I put them all to sleep.
 RIKER / To... sleep.
 DATA / Yessir.
 RIKER / Status of Borg power drive... ?
 WORF / Minimal power...
 RIKER / Electromagnetic field?
 WORF / Nonexistent.
 RIKER / (reacts) Commander Shelby, take an away team and confirm that the Borg... are... asleep.
 RIKER / (keying insignia) Any indication to how long we can keep them like this...
 WORF / (to Shelby) Commander, tricorder readings are fluctuating rapidly...
 BEVERLY / There's no way to know what the destruction of the Borg ship will do to him...
 DATA / We should also consider the advantages of further examination of the Borg and their vessel, sir.
 RIKER / (beat) I don't think so. Mister Data, separate yourself from Captain Picard.
 RIKER / (keys insignia) Away Team, get yourselves home. Mister Crusher, upon their return move us to a safe position.
 BEVERLY / Life signs are stable... the DNA around the microcircuit fiber implants is returning to normal...
 TROI / How do you feel?
 PICARD / Almost human. (smiles slightly) With a bit of a headache...
 BEVERLY / We'll get you to Sickbay... (to Riker) We won't have any trouble getting these implants out now.
 RIKER / (to Picard) How much do you remember?
 PICARD / Everything. (beat) Including some brilliantly unorthodox strategy by a former first officer of mine.
 RIKER / ... and Earth Station McKinley has advised they're ready to begin refitting the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Have they estimated the time for repairs... ?
 RIKER / Five to six weeks...
 PICARD & RIKER / Come.
 PICARD / Permission granted. They picked a fine officer for the task force, Commander.
 RIKER / Everyone's so concerned about my next job. With all due respect, Commander... sir... (with a nod in Picard's direction) ... my career plans are my own business, no one else's. (beat) But it's nice to know I'll have a few options.
 RIKER / Course to Station McKinley is laid in and ready, sir...
 PICARD / Make it so, Number One.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44085.7. We have moved into Sector Two-One-Nine-Four-Seven in response to a distress call from a Talarian observation craft. The alien vessel appears adrift, and our initial probe has detected a life-threatening radiation leak within its propulsion system.
 To include MAIN VIEWER. PICARD, TROI, and RIKER in the Command Chairs. DATA at Ops, WORF at Tactical, WESLEY at Conn. / 
 WORF / Sir, I get no further response from the vessel.
 PICARD / Maintain an open channel.
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher and her assistants are waiting in Transporter Room Three, Captain.
 DATA / Sir, I must remind you that during the Galen border conflicts a common tactic of the Talarians was to abandon their observation craft, rig them to self-destruct...
 PICARD / (nods) ... and issue a general distress call, yes, I know...
 DATA / This particular guerilla maneuver resulted in two hundred and nineteen fatalities over a three- year period.
 RIKER / Data, is there any way to detect their self-destruct device?
 DATA / Negative, Commander. The Talarians employ a subspace proximity detonator. It would not be detectable to our scans...
 RIKER / (joining in) ... or the Away Team's tricorders. Right.
 WORF / Captain, the Talarian warship Q'Maire is responding to the distress call.
 PICARD / Position?
 WORF / Halfway through the Woden sector.
 WESLEY / It'll take them hours to get here, sir, even at maximum warp.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / There is life on board... but it's fading.
 PICARD / Number One, assemble the rest of your away team and prepare for immediate rescue operations.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 WORF / (checking tricorder) Ancilary power is failing, Commander.
 BEVERLY / They're nothing more than children!
 RIKER / I am Commander Riker of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We will evacuate you and give you medical care. You will not be harmed.
 BEVERLY / (keying insignia) Enterprise, prepping five Talarian males for transport directly to Sickbay... Trauma Team, stand by to receive injured... we have radiation burns, possible respiratory distress...
 BEVERLY / Stand by for my order.
 RIKER / Captain, it looks like this was a basic training ship. Five boys... in their teens... all in uniform...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Proceed with the evacuation, Number One.
 WORF / No other life signs on board, sir.
 BEVERLY'S (O.C.) / Commander! Quickly!
 RIKER / What is it?
 BEVERLY (O.C.) / Look... this boy... he's human!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental: We have completed emergency evacuation of four Talarians -- and one human. How this young man found himself in the custody of these aliens remains a mystery.
 BEVERLY / It's Jono, right? Is that what I heard them call you?
 BEVERLY / I'm Doctor Crusher. I'm examining you for radiation injuries. It won't hurt. (beat) I have a son not much older than you. Maybe you'd like to meet him.
 BEVERLY / (gamely) Well, Jono... you seem to have escaped radiation damage. Pretty lucky. (reacting to something on the tricorder) How did this happen -- ?
 BEVERLY / What is it?
 TROI / He's -- terrified.
 BEVERLY / They all just started up, Captain.
 PICARD / May I have your attention, please?
 PICARD / Please -- may I have your attention?
 PICARD / Stop that immediately!
 PICARD / Well. That's better. Now, what's your name, young man?
 TROI / He won't talk, Captain. We haven't been able to get through to him.
 BEVERLY / He managed to escape radiation trauma... but his scans showed something else...
 PICARD / What?
 BEVERLY / Two previously fractured ribs... a broken arm... a low-grade concussion. There may be neurological impairment... I'll have to examine him further. Jean Luc -- the Talarians have always been ruthless to their enemies... I think there's a real possibility they may have brutalized the child.
 PICARD / Isn't it possible he was injured prior to his captivity?
 BEVERLY / Not likely. He's been with them a long time... long enough to assimilate their cultural traits... and calcium trace patterns indicate the injuries occurred during the past seven years.
 PICARD / (frowns) But if they have... abused the boy... why would he devoutly wish to return to them?
 BEVERLY / That's not uncommon. It was identified centuries ago as the "Stockholm syndrome."
 PICARD / Now what?
 TROI / I suggested he take off his gloves... Suddenly he went out of control.
 BEVERLY / (hits insignia) Security, we need some assistance in Sickbay...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged, Doctor.
 PICARD / Jono -- !
 PICARD / She was trying to help you!
 PICARD / Jono -- I want you to stop this immediately!
 PICARD / That's better. Now, if we're to accomplish anything --
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (interrupting) Data to Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / We have received a subspace communique from Starfleet Command, regarding the young human, sir.
 PICARD / Very well. Doctor, Counselor... (join me)
 BEVERLY / Mister Worf, escort this young man to quarters... he's to be confined there until further notice.
 WORF / Yes, Doctor.
 WORF / They are not my captors. They are my comrades.
 WORF / (reacts) Doctor Crusher? She is my superior officer.
 WORF / You are human, and among humans, females can achieve anything males can.
 WORF / You are confused...
 WORF / Stop that!
 DATA / By matching DNA gene types, Starfleet was able to identify the young man as Jeremiah Rossa...
 RIKER / (recognizing the name) Rossa...
 PICARD / ... as in Admiral Rossa, Data?
 DATA / She is his grandmother, Captain.
 DATA / He was born fourteen years ago on the Federation Colony, Galen Four. His parents, Connor and Moira Rossa, were killed in a border skirmish three years, nine months later when the colony was overrun by Talarian forces.
 PICARD / I remember. There were no survivors.
 DATA / The child was listed as missing and presumed dead.
 RIKER / I knew another one of the Rossas who was killed in action at the Krasner outpost...
 PICARD / (nods) Tragedy, it seems, follows the Rossa Family... the Admiral has lost both her sons...
 BEVERLY / She'll have something to celebrate now...
 TROI / Captain... if Jeremiah were returned to his family in his present condition... it would be a wrenching experience for everyone. Especially for him. He needs to re-discover his identity. He has to make some connection with his roots.
 PICARD / I agree. Please take whatever means you need to accomplish that, Counselor.
 TROI / I don't think I can do anything, Captain.
 PICARD / Why not?
 BEVERLY / Troi's right. It's very clear that the boy does not respond well to women.
 DATA / The Talarians are a rigidly patriarchical society.
 TROI / Jeremiah needs to build a relationship with a man... a father figure... with whom he can explore his origins... and I think it should be you, Captain.
 PICARD / (over my dead body) Oh, no, Counselor! I don't think so. He needs someone who is -- trained in these things.
 TROI / But you are the only person on board to whom he has shown any connection. If Jeremiah is to find his -- humanity -- then you are the only one who can help him. It's up to you, Captain.
 PICARD / Jono... why do you make that noise?
 PICARD / Is it not also the custom of your people to listen to the wishes of their Captain?
 PICARD / Then, as Captain of the Starship Enterprise, I ask you not to make that sound.
 PICARD / Good. Well. Now that we have that cleared up... (tries to look cheerful) Let's... get acquainted, shall we?
 PICARD / (looking around) What do you think of your quarters? I know it's a bit -- sterile. But if there's anything you'd like... pictures, perhaps, or games...
 PICARD / Not at all. I thought you would be comfortable here --
 PICARD / (temporizing) We will rendezvous with the warship Q'maire at Oh-seven-forty. We are preparing to transfer the Talarians to Captain Endar.
 PICARD / We will... discuss... your situation with Captain Endar.
 PICARD / Well, we can find other quarters.
 PICARD / Ah. Yes, well... that won't work, here.
 PICARD / I'm sure you'll see... there's nothing here that would appeal to a young person.
 PICARD / Put that down, please.
 PICARD / Yes. Put it back where you got it.
 PICARD / Well. Here we are, eh, Jono?
 PICARD / I notice you haven't taken off your gloves...
 PICARD / Why not?
 PICARD / Jono... your Captain, Endar? Has he ever hurt you? (off Jono) Inflicted pain?
 PICARD / Then he has.
 PICARD / Is that what they are? Tests of pain?
 PICARD / It's true I don't fully understand Talarians. But... you are not Talarian.
 PICARD / Come.
 TROI / You wanted to see me, Captain?
 PICARD / Ah, yes, Counselor. Please -- sit down.
 PICARD / You may not be aware of this, but I have never been particularly comfortable around children.
 TROI / Really?
 PICARD / For some reason, they just don't seem to respond to me.
 TROI / I see...
 PICARD / Frankly, I think my time is best served carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a Starfleet Captain.
 TROI / Seldom have I heard an explanation so well rehearsed.
 PICARD / All right, Counselor... I just don't think I'm the right person for this job.
 TROI / Strange, isn't it? You'll travel light years, dodge asteroid storms, brave hostile aliens... but when asked to assume a parental role, you cringe. Why do you suppose that is?
 PICARD / I'm not cringing... I am simply acknowledging my limitations.
 TROI / (musing) When you were a child, did you have many friends? Other children you played with?
 PICARD / No, but I don't think that has anything to do with anything... (beat, pondering) Perhaps it's because... no, this is foolish. What does it matter?
 TROI / What were you going to say?
 PICARD / Just that... ever since I was a child... I knew exactly what I wanted -- to be a member of Starfleet. Nothing else mattered to me. Virtually my entire youth was spent pursuing that goal. In fact... (beat) I think... that I may have skipped my childhood.
 TROI / You know, Captain, almost no one is born being a good parent. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / Most people simply have to muddle through it, doing the best job they can.
 PICARD / And... that's what I'm going to have to do?
 TROI / Yes. And you might be surprised at how good you could be.
 PICARD / Computer, turn off that noise!
 PICARD / Computer, what was that?
 PICARD / Jono? Where are you?
 PICARD / Yes, I certainly did, and I expect it to stay turned off. Jono, would you come down from there?
 PICARD / (indicating room) I see you've made yourself at home.
 PICARD / Right... Jono, I want to show you something.
 PICARD / Those are Connor and Moira Rossa -- your parents. That baby is you... Jeremiah Rossa.
 PICARD / You were born Jeremiah, on Galen Four. Your colony was destroyed, later, during a border skirmish.
 PICARD / You knew how to laugh once.
 PICARD / Do you remember any of that? Your parents, your home?
 PICARD / Jono, your parents were killed by Talarians...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain?
 PICARD / What is it, Number One?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We have visual contact with the warship Q'Maire.
 PICARD / (warning hand) You stay put. (to Riker) I'm on my way.
 PICARD / Status, Mister Data.
 DATA / Q'maire at station, holding steady at bearing zero-one-three, mark zero-one-five. Distance five-zero-six kilometers.
 PICARD / Are its weapons systems active?
 DATA / Negative.
 WORF / Captain Endar requests an open channel.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We have rescued four crew members from your observation craft. They have received medical attention and are ready for transport.
 RIKER / (sotto) You're welcome, I'm sure.
 PICARD / One moment, Captain. We have also discovered a human among your crew.
 PICARD / Actually, his name is Jeremiah -- Jeremiah Rossa.
 PICARD / He was not wounded in the mishap...
 PICARD / But as a representative of the Federation I demand an explanation. Why has this child been held in your custody all these years?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental: Endar's claim that Jeremiah Rossa is his son is clearly unacceptable.
 PICARD (V.O.) / However, to avoid escalating tensions, I have extended an invitation to the Talarian leader to come aboard the Enterprise so that we may address the issue face-to-face.
 PICARD / Among them Connor and Moira Rossa.
 PICARD / And so, you -- kidnapped him.
 PICARD / You should have notified Federation authorities. To conceal him was a clear violation of our agreement.
 PICARD / What... tradition... is it that empowered you to capture a helpless child?
 PICARD / (weighing this) I understand your tradition, Endar. May I ask... does it extend also to brutalizing the surrogate son?
 PICARD / Our medical officer found evidence of injuries so severe that they might even be considered torture...
 PICARD / Then explain the fractured ribs! The concussion... the broken arm...
 PICARD / Doesn't he deserve to become more than that?
 PICARD / His heritage is human, Endar.
 PICARD / (an inner decision made) Captain Endar, while on board, you are welcome to supervise the return of your crew. But I cannot allow Jeremiah Rossa to be returned to your custody. His true family is waiting for him on Earth.
 PICARD / I have already reported our position and the nature of this violation to Starfleet.
 PICARD / (amazed) Are you saying you would be willing to go to war over the boy?
 PICARD / We have been at peace for years. Let us not rush headlong toward war.
 TROI / Those were your parents. Do you remember them?
 TROI / And who is your mother?
 TROI / And the men? What is their purpose?
 TROI / The tests... endurance, pain, determination... all so that you can excel at making war?
 TROI / And the females? Surely they are weak.
 TROI / I see.
 TROI / And when you look at this picture... of you and the human female who was your mother... how do you feel about her?
 PICARD / Then you think it would be unwise to let Endar see Jono.
 BEVERLY / I think it's dangerous. Abusers can have subtle but powerful influence over their victims.
 PICARD / (a beat) I'm not convinced he was abused, Doctor. I've talked to the man, and if I am any judge of character... I'd say he deeply cares about the boy's welfare.
 BEVERLY / Captain, we learned long ago always to err on the side of protecting the child. I think Endar should be kept away from Jono.
 TROI / I'm not sure I agree, Captain.
 TROI / I sense... awakening memories in the boy... this is a very fragile time for Jono, and if we send away the man he calls "father" without even letting them see each other -- how will we ever gain his trust?
 PICARD / Yes... There is also something else we should keep in mind. We are deep in Talarian territory. A semblance of diplomacy is called for. (beat) I shall allow the visit.
 BEVERLY / All I ask... is that the visit be supervised. Don't let them be alone together.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 WORF / Captain, sensors indicate two warships approaching from opposite directions along the border.
 PICARD / Their offensive potential?
 DATA / Talarian warships are limited to neutral particle weapons, high-energy X-ray lasers and merculite rockets. No match for the Enterprise, Captain.
 PICARD / The last thing I want is to be forced into destroying one of their ships.
 RIKER / They won't back off. They've been willing to fight to the death in past encounters.
 PICARD / (somber) The lines are being drawn... all this for a chosen son.
 WORF / Is it worth it, Captain? To go to war -- over a child?
 BEVERLY / You might not ask that, Lieutenant, if he were your child.
 PICARD / There must be a way to avoid this...
 TROI / If we can just reach Jono... help him to make some connection with his origins... then he may choose to come with us.
 RIKER / Do you really think Endar would go along with that?
 DATA / If Endar respects Talarian custom, he may have to. (off reactions) According to their tradition, a male child of fourteen has reached the age of decision. They undergo a ceremony of initiation and after that have the freedom to make their own choices.
 PICARD / (with hope) Endar's entire claim on Jono is based on Talarian custom... he'd have a hard time backing away from it now...
 WORF / Captain -- there's a subspace communication from Starfleet Command.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / Sir, the message is for Jeremiah Rossa.
 PICARD / Have the boy brought to my Ready Room.
 CONNAUGHT / Jeremiah... my name is Connaught Rossa. I am your father's mother. I wish we could talk in person, but that will have to wait. When I heard the miracle that you were alive, I wanted to reach out to you as soon as possible. (beat) I find myself wondering what you look like... and all I can do is imagine your father at your age. (MORE)
 CONNAUGHT (Cont'd) / You come from a family that would make you proud. Many of them have given their lives to bring peace to the galaxy. You are the last of the Rossas. I am so very thankful that you have been given back to us, to carry on the line. (beat) Your grandfather and I will greet you with all the love in our hearts. Have a safe journey home, Jeremiah.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / She is an Admiral.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / Jono...
 PICARD / Jono -- let me show you what I do when I get those feelings.
 PICARD / (demonstrating) I serve from here... like this... (serves) And you must hit it back before it bounces twice. Let's try it.
 PICARD / Not bad.
 PICARD / I can believe it. Well, shall we give this a try?
 PICARD / Jono? You all right?
 CONNOR'S VOICE / Take him and get to cover!
 PICARD / Jono -- what is it?!
 CONNOR'S VOICE / Take Jeremiah... get to the forest! I'll hold them off!
 CONNOR'S VOICE / Go!
 PICARD / It is part of being human, Jono. But as deeply as you can feel hurt -- you can also feel joy.
 PICARD / Jono -- are you tired?
 RIKER / Well, how was racquetball?
 PICARD / He gave me quite a game for his first time out.
 PICARD / I'm sure you do. sit down, Jono. What would you like?
 WESLEY / That's called a banana split and it's maybe the best thing there is in the universe. (pushes it forward) Here -- give it a try.
 DATA / It is called a spoon.
 WESLEY / Go ahead.
 DATA / I fail to see why this is amusing.
 RIKER / (still chuckling) Check your data banks on humor... subheading "Slapstick"...
 DATA / (inspecting Wesley) Comedy stressing farce and horseplay... ah, this no doubt is a variation on... "Pie in the Face"...
 RIKER / Now do you see why it's funny?
 DATA / No, I do not. But I will take your word. It is very amusing.
 WESLEY / Let's start over. A fresh banana split for me, one for my friend here.
 PICARD / Look at him. He's like a different person.
 RIKER / Who would ever have thought he could laugh out loud like that?
 PICARD / And half an hour ago he was crying in my arms like a baby.
 BEVERLY / Two bleeders... single-plane penetration... (calling out) I need the autosuture over here!
 BEVERLY / (continuing) It looks like the blade hit the sternum and was deflected... it could have been a lot worse.
 PICARD / Then it wasn't a dream...
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid not...
 BEVERLY / No vital organs were pierced... no major arteries...
 PICARD / Where is the boy now?
 BEVERLY / Worf has him in security. Hold still...
 PICARD / I want to see him. Here, now.
 BEVERLY / (firmly) He'll wait until I'm finished.
 WORF / Talarian warships converging, Commander, range five hundred kilometers.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / Any communication, Lieutenant Worf?
 WORF / No, sir. We have an open channel.
 WESLEY / Commander, the warships' closing velocities are decreasing... staggered approach vectors bearing zero, one hundred twenty, and two hundred forty degrees.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to La Forge.
 GEORDI / La Forge here, sir.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Geordi, the Talarians are moving into attack posture. Classic triangular envelopment.
 GEORDI / I've tapped the impulse engines for additional power to shields, Commander. We're ready.
 WORF / Commander, Captain of the Q'Maire requests communication.
 RIKER / Well, here we go. On screen.
 RIKER / This is Commander Riker. What are your intentions, Captain Endar?
 RIKER / (beat) He has been injured. I am in command now.
 RIKER / I'm afraid that's not possible. Last night, Jono attacked Captain Picard and tried to murder him. We are holding him in custody.
 RIKER / He'll have to come back with us now, Endar. It will be up to Starfleet to decide the consequences.
 RIKER / Red alert.
 WORF / Talarian vessels routing power to forward rockets...
 RIKER / (frowns, sighs) Ready all weapons, Mister Worf...
 PICARD / Jono... why did you do it?
 PICARD / I think it does. It matters to me.
 PICARD / You think you are to be killed?
 PICARD / Jono, you aren't going to die at my hands or anyone else's.
 PICARD / What I want to know is why? You seemed so happy just a few hours ago...
 WORF / Q'Maire is requesting communication on a secure channel, Commander.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / Our position has not changed. We are returning him to Starfleet.
 PICARD (O.S.) / One moment, Captain...
 PICARD / Captain Endar, last night Jono attacked me with a dagger.
 PICARD / (silencing hand) There was a crime committed on board this ship... but it was not Jono's -- it was mine.
 PICARD / (continuing) When we found Jono, it seemed so clear what had to be done. We knew if he could only be persuaded to make the decision to stay... you would most likely let him. So with the best of intentions, we tried to convince him... and, in so doing, thoroughly failed to listen... to his feelings, his needs.
 PICARD / (continuing) That was the crime, and it has taken a huge toll on a strong and noble young man. It must be rectified.
 PICARD / (continuing) Jono will return home -- to the only home he has ever known. To the father that he loves. To you, Endar.
 PICARD / Please transmit coordinates for his immediate transport.
 PICARD / Goodbye, Jono.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44143.7. Due to a medical emergency, we have been forced to cut short a two-day liberty on Ogus Two and set course for Starbase Four-One-Six.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) It seems a young man's practical joke has come dangerously close to a lethal conclusion.
 RIKER is standing alone at the window (with the ship / travelling at Warp speed) as Troi and Jake ENTER. Troi motions Jake to sit.
 RIKER / Well Mister Potts, why don't we start at the beginning?
 JAKE / (still trembling) It was a joke, sir. I just meant to scare him.
 RIKER / From the beginning, please.
 JAKE / (nervously and very quickly) We were at the arcade, sir. I brought this balloon with me, filled with red pillion dye. You see, Willie is always making fun of me. I figured I'd get him back. I only meant to scare him.
 TROI / Slow down, Jake.
 JAKE / (slower) We programmed the game for an ordinary laser duel. You know, twenty-one points. Four points for a...
 RIKER / (interrupting) I'm familiar with the game. Go on.
 JAKE / We went out to the forest behind the east arcade. I told Willie that his laser pistol looked kind of funny, almost like a real one. When I went behind the trees, I put the balloon into my vest, and then...
 RIKER / So you made your nine year-old brother think he killed you?
 JAKE / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / And then he ran away.
 JAKE / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / And while he was hiding he ate the fruit of a cove palm.
 JAKE / It was just a joke. I didn't...
 RIKER / I assume you are aware of the infectious nature of the parasites which inhabit cove palms?
 JAKE / I am now, sir.
 RIKER / Are you familiar with the condition upon which I agreed to allow you two boys to remain on the Enterprise when your parents went on sabbatical?
 JAKE / That we'd stay out of trouble, sir.
 RIKER / (keys insignia) Mister Data. (to Jake) Think about it Mister Potts. And while you're at it, think about what might have happened had we not been this close to a starbase medical facility.
 RIKER / Have you contacted the boy's parents?
 DATA / (nodding) They are fully aware of the situation, sir.
 RIKER / Good, escort this young man to the quarantine anteroom. Perhaps he'll be helpful in lifting his brother's spirits.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / (to Jake) Please don't think that you have heard the last of this, Mister Potts.
 JAKE / No, sir. I mean yes, sir.
 TROI / He's very frightened.
 RIKER / As well he should be. I've never been a proponent of practical jokes. More often than not, they have unfortunate results.
 TROI / I wouldn't be surprised if this was his last practical joke for a long while.
 RIKER / I'm more concerned with his brother's future at the moment, Counselor.
 DATA / Our Sickbay does have the facility to isolate parasitic proto-viruses but not in a favorable time frame for your brother.
 JAKE / (more to himself) He really could die.
 DATA / Fortunately we are only two days from Starbase Four-One-Six, and their laboratory can...
 JAKE / Can what sir?
 JAKE / Their laboratory can do what, Commander?
 JAKE / (continuing) Sir, I know I made a mistake... I can tell you're angry... but if you're not going to talk to me...
 PICARD, WORF, and WESLEY. SUPERNUMERARY at Ops. / FOLLOW Riker and Troi, as they ENTER from the Observation Lounge and cross to the Command Center. DATA descends the ramp toward Ops. / 
 RIKER / Back so soon, Mister Data?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to bridge.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Commander.
 GEORDI / We've completed our dilithium vector calibrations, sir. You're clear to increase to warp seven.
 PICARD / Very good, Geordi. Let me know if you...
 WORF / (cutting in) Captain, did you request a course correction?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Sir, I didn't say we could increase speed to warp nine-point- one.
 WESLEY / (surprised) New course set for heading three-four-one mark two-two-one.
 RIKER / Course set by whom?
 WESLEY / Not me, Commander.
 PICARD / (to Riker) What's going on?
 RIKER / (notices Data calmly working his panel) Data, who programmed the new coordinates?
 WESLEY / Warp nine-point-three, sir.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I don't advise this, Captain. If we're going to maintain the realignment progression we shouldn't be pushing more than warp eight for at least an hour.
 PICARD / (to Data, calmly) Commander...
 PICARD / Turbolifts Three and Four, gentlemen. (to com) Geordi, transfer helm to Engineering.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Reassemble in Engineering. (to com) La Forge, let's get a diagnostic sweep underway...
 GEORDI / Not yet. Computer, isolate cause of life support failure.
 GEORDI / (to Kopf) How could that be? There are seven independent safety interlocks to prevent that.
 GEORDI / Sir, I think we've found the problem, but it doesn't really make sense.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) It seems we have more than one problem. Bring the Enterprise to a full stop, Commander.
 GEORDI / Full stop, Ensign Kopf.
 PICARD / I ordered all helm control transferred down here, damn it!
 GEORDI / We did sir. We've been waiting for your instructions.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm going to have to do this at the manual input level, sir.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Wes...
 RIKER / (reading a wall panel) We're still on the altered heading, Captain, holding at warp nine point three.
 WORF / (at another panel) Force fields have been established on all Main Bridge turbolift doors and service crawlways, sir.
 PICARD / (putting it all together) Computer, locate Lieutenant Commander Data.
 RIKER / What the hell is he up to?
 PICARD / Number One, take a security team up to Deck Two. See if you can break through from below.
 GEORDI / Everything's locked up, Captain. No control of impulse or warp engines down here.
 WESLEY / Navigation doesn't respond either, sir.
 PICARD / Picard to bridge. Commander Data do you hear me?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I repeat.   Data, do you hear...
 DATA / Computer. Recognize Data, Lieutenant Commander. Alpha One clearance.
 DATA / Maintain minimum auxiliary power and disengage subspace communications.
 WESLEY / (studying a panel) He is on the Bridge, sir.
 PICARD / Commander La Forge, prepare for saucer separation.
 WESLEY / Sir, we're at Warp nine-three!
 PICARD / I'm aware of the risks, Ensign. (to Geordi) When the umbilical splits, we should regain primary control... do you agree?
 GEORDI / (getting the plan) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (to Worf) . Be prepared to sweep back and pull it in with a tractor beam.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Initiate auto sequence.
 DATA / (in Picard's voice) Computer, recognize Picard, Jean- Luc. Alpha Two clearance.
 DATA / (in Picard's voice) Cancel separation sequence.
 DATA / (in Picard's voice) Isolate all remaining command functions and accept related orders and inquiries from Main Bridge only.
 GEORDI / The separation sequence has been aborted, Captain.
 PICARD / Computer, recognize Jean-Luc Picard Alpha Two priority and re-establish separation procedures immediately.
 PICARD / And just what location are they accepted from?
 WESLEY / (to Picard) You're the only one who has clearance to localize command functions, sir.
 PICARD / (disgusted) It seems Mister Data has acquired them, as well.
 WORF / (studying a schematic on a panel below) The isolinear subprocessor extends three-point-five meters.
 RIKER (O.C.) / I've got a clear path to panel J14-Baker. What's that going to do for us?
 WORF / J14-Baker backs onto Science Station Two, Commander.
 RIKER (O.C.) / Have they reinverted the environmental control sequencer?
 WORF / Yes, sir. Life support has been re-established.
 RIKER (O.C.) / Then, you and Casey get up here. Let's get to it.
 DATA / Computer. Configure a perimeter field charge, sections Nine-K through Twelve-T.
 RIKER (O.C.) / What the hell was that?
 WORF (O.C.) / He's activated a force field, sir.
 RIKER (O.C.) / Great! Just great!!
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Chief O'Brien.
 PICARD / You had better disable the site- to-site transport function. When we get to wherever we're going, I don't want him beaming off the bridge.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Is your quarantine intact, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Sickbay force fields don't seem to have been affected.
 PICARD / The boy?
 BEVERLY / He's alright. But he's not going to stay alright. Sir, we need to get this ship to a starbase medical facility...
 PICARD / It seems, Doctor, that Mister Data has other plans for the Enterprise right now.
 BEVERLY / C'mon, I can't believe that! Everybody's played a practical joke at one time or another.
 BEVERLY / (continuing exam) Not even a little one? How about April Fools'? Are you telling me you've never tried to pull something on April Fools' Day?
 BEVERLY / Well, I'm sure your brother didn't intend this to get out of hand.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Certainly not to the degree it has. Take a deep breath.
 BEVERLY / A deep breath.
 BEVERLY / Have you been drinking all the water I asked you to?
 BEVERLY / Well, keep it up. We may have a short delay in reaching the starbase and I want you...
 JAKE / (to Troi) There! You see? How can I tell him if he's not going to listen to me?
 TROI / Why don't you try, Jake?
 JAKE / It's just a waste of time. He won't listen.
 DATA / Computer, prepare to transport me directly to the following coordinates.
 DATA / Can you override?
 DATA / Show me the shortest route to Transporter Room One.
 DATA / Computer, prepare to activate a cascade force field sequence in the following progression.
 GEORDI / No matter what we try, the computer will only acknowledge commands from the bridge, sir.
 WORF / (disgusted) He's blocked every subspace channel, Captain. We can't even call for help.
 PICARD / (to Wesley) Have you tried tracing back navigation inputs?
 WESLEY / (nodding his head) We don't even know what star system we're in, sir.
 RIKER / The only way we knew we'd come out of warp was by looking out a window.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Chief.
 PICARD / What now?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / How much further can you safely disable the ransporters, Mister O'Brien?
 PICARD / (to Worf) I want security teams along the main passageways and in every transporter oom, Lieutenant. See if the computer would be good enough to give you the specific stun setting to disable Mister Data.
 PICARD / Computer, estimate time from this location to Starbase Four-One-Six at warp nine.
 DATA / (in Picard's voice) Computer, establish a security code for access to all functions previously transferred to Bridge.
 DATA / (in Picard's voice speaking at a breakneck speed) Four, one, three, three, six, eight, Tango, one, eight, one, one, seven, one, Charlie, four, Victor, three... eight, eight, eight, zero, Foxtrot, six, one, five, three, three, five, nine, five, seven, lock.
 DATA / (in Picard's voice) Computer, initiate cascade sequence, accepting instructions from Commander Data en route, now.
 GEORDI / He's out. Security team approaching location.
 DATA / Intersection Eight-J. Aft-port. Establish.
 WORF / I order you to stop.
 DATA / Computer, begin scan-phase.
 WORF / No, it's too close.
 RIKER / This has gone far enough, Data.
 DATA / Computer, three-meter cross-seal.
 RIKER / What's he doing?
 RIKER / Does that mean he'll be able to...
 RIKER / Great!
 RIKER / Great!
 DATA / I fail to recall how I arrived here.
 DATA / Data to Enterprise.
 DATA / Enterprise, do you read me?
 DATA / (still standing) We were headed for a medical facility. I was taking the boy's brother to Sickbay and...
 DATA / I must find a way to contact the Enterprise.
 DATA / You do bear a resemblance to Doctor Noonian Soong, the cyberneticist who constructed me. But, Doctor Soong was killed shortly afterward by the Crystalline Entity.
 DATA / But the colony was destroyed, there were no survivors.
 DATA / It is really you.
 DATA / Perhaps you could help me contact my ship.
 DATA / (a bit confused by the quick change in subject) The moisture content of the ship's atmosphere is maintained at a moderate thirty-seven percent.
 DATA / I can differentiate between varying hygrometric levels.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Humid air feels different against my skin, sir. And it carries smells differently. I assume this is due to the fact that moisture...
 DATA / May I ask why you have brought me here?
 DATA / Your response refers to how you brought me here, not why.
 DATA / I assumed you dead, sir.
 GEORDI / The quarantine field in Sickbay, sir.
 PICARD / You have access to it?
 WESLEY / (nodding) When he transferred force field control to the Bridge he must have only specified fields he was planning to initiate. The quarantine field was already operating.
 GEORDI / Under normal circumstances, we could divert that field energy and use it to cancel the force field protecting the bridge... But we have to retain the medical quarantine.
 PICARD / Determine the absolute minimum field energy that Doctor Crusher needs... and use the rest to get me onto my bridge.
 BEVERLY / How are you feeling this morning?
 BEVERLY / You know the old story about the man who tells his doctor, "It hurts when I raise my arm like this?"
 BEVERLY / (continues, lowering her arm) The doctor says, "Then don't raise your arm like that."
 BEVERLY / Don't stand up.
 GEORDI / Okay Doc, we're ready. If all goes well you shouldn't notice a thing.
 BEVERLY / Make sure all goes well, Commander.
 BEVERLY / Your brother says you still won't speak to him.
 BEVERLY / This is very hard on him, too. He feels very guilty about what happened. He's your brother.
 BEVERLY / Nobody's going to die, Willie. Do you hear me? Nobody!
 WORF / (to com) Captain, we are in.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We're on our way, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Computer, restore Tactical Station.
 RIKER / Beverly thinks its going to be tight. Let's hope he didn't take us too far off course.
 PICARD / Let's hope.
 WORF / (to Picard) It won't answer to my clearance, sir.
 PICARD / (to Computer) Computer, this is Captain Picard. Return all command functions to stations.
 PICARD / (furious) Security code!?
 GEORDI / I was afraid of something like that.
 WORF / Sensors are operative.
 RIKER / Well at least that's something. What have you got?
 WORF / (checking his panel) No fix on Data. But I am picking up a single lifeform on the surface, sir. It appears human.
 PICARD / That's one human who's got the answers to a lot of questions.
 WORF / Something else, sir.
 PICARD / What is it?
 WORF / A small vessel... entering orbit. I detect no lifeforms aboard.
 DATA / Sir?
 DATA / It was Starfleet officers who rescued me.
 DATA / What choice of vocation would have met with your approval?
 DATA / To follow in your footsteps, as it were?
 DATA / May I ask you a question, sir?
 DATA / Why did you create me?
 DATA / Old things?
 DATA / There are many possible explanations.
 DATA / Perhaps, for humans, old things represent a tie to the past.
 DATA / Humans are mortal. They seem to need a sense of continuity.
 DATA / To give their lives meaning... A sense of purpose.
 DATA / I suppose it is a factor in the human desire to procreate.
 DATA / It is a reasonable explanation to your query, sir.
 DATA / Lore!!
 DATA / Doctor, I implore you, please do not reactivate him.
 DATA / But he admitted to an alliance with the Crystal Entity. To gain its favor he betrayed the colonists and would have betrayed the Enterprise as well had I not...
 DATA / And, as I have explained, it was I who was responsible for his reactivation. But it serves no purpose to make the same mistake twice.
 DATA / I had no alternative. You would have destroyed the Enterprise.
 DATA / (after a beat) Dying from what, sir?
 DATA / Dying from what, sir?
 WORF / We have control of sensors, life support and auxiliary power, Captain. Nothing more.
 PICARD / The code, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / (shaking his head) We can't even locate the file address. At least that would tell us how many digits we're talking about. Not that it would really help.
 PICARD / I want something that will really help.
 BEVERLY / And quickly. Willie Potts has twenty-four hours, thirty-six tops. If it goes longer than that, the only thing Starbase Four-One-Six will have left to do is a postmortem.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Geordi, if the computer's programmed to allow Data to transport down, it would figure that it would allow him to beam back up. Right?
 GEORDI / It would figure.
 RIKER / And Data left a trace imprint when he beamed down?
 GEORDI / (nodding) Everyone does.
 RIKER / So what would be involved in pulling that trace and finding a way to make the computer think someone else is Data? Maybe a few someone elses?
 GEORDI / We'd have to access the transport controller and reset it to a testing mode; convince it that it's back in school accepting simulated inputs. It's going to be tough without the main computer, but we could network a few tricorders together.
 PICARD / Try, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Lore told me the colonists became envious of him because you made him "so completely human."
 DATA / Lore also said the colonists petitioned you to replace him with a "less perfect" android?
 DATA / (to himself) It was a lie. Another lie.
 DATA / (to himself) I am not less perfect than Lore.
 DATA / (to himself) I am not less perfect than Lore.
 DATA / I question your sincerity, Lore.
 DATA / But sir, Lore was responsible for...
 PICARD / They're sure this is going to work?
 RIKER / Nobody knows the Transporters better than O'Brien and La Forge. They tell me they've managed more than a little sleight of hand with our authorization codes.
 PICARD / And they can insert them into the recall loop?
 RIKER / (nodding) The computer should think all three of us are Data.
 RIKER / (continuing; joking) Let's just hope we don't all beam back looking like Data.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Bring him home, Number One.
 PICARD / (cont'd) Energize.
 WORF / The human is there.
 RIKER / And Data?
 WORF / No way of knowing.
 RIKER / On stun.
 RIKER / Worf.
 RIKER / (comforting Soong) It's all right, take it easy.
 GEORDI / (stares at Soong and recognizes him) It's Noonian Soong.
 RIKER / That's impossible. Soong's dead. (he continues to check out Soong) I think it's okay to move him.
 GEORDI / (shaking his head) Look at this stuff. I'm telling you. It's Soong.
 RIKER / I'm Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
 RIKER / Here. Let me.
 RIKER / Do you mind telling me what's going on, here?
 DATA / (to Soong) He surprised me. He rendered me unconscious. What happened?
 RIKER / Who surprised you?
 RIKER / Who went back to his ship? Damn it, Data, what's going on?!
 DATA / (turning to Riker) Lore, sir. He was inadvertently summoned here by the same signal which activated my homing circuitry. It seems that after two years in interstellar space, he was...
 RIKER / (interrupting) Mister Data. We've got a very sick boy on the Enterprise who's not getting any better. And we're dead in the water until you get us out of here.
 DATA / (to Riker) I was unaware of the inconvenience I have caused, sir.
 RIKER / We'll discuss it later. (turning to Soong) You're coming, too, Doctor. You need to get to Sickbay.
 GEORDI / With all due respect, sir, you don't look fine to me.
 DATA / But sir, our medical facility could most likely...
 DATA / (whispers) May I say goodbye to Doctor Soong, sir?
 DATA / (whispering) Alone, sir?
 DATA / Do you believe... in some ways, we are alike?
 DATA / Then it is alright for you to die... because I will remain alive.
 DATA / (continuing) You know I cannot grieve for you.
 DATA / Goodbye.....Father.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44149.1. We have been at Starbase Four-One-Six for three days. Young Willie Potts is responding well to treatment and has been returned to the Enterprise.
 PICARD / The transfer went well?
 BEVERLY / (nodding) He'll remain in quarantine for another week or two, but he's out of the woods.
 DATA / Yes, Captain. The boys appear to have reconciled their differences.
 BEVERLY / They're brothers, Data. Brothers forgive.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 44009.3
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) The Enterprise remains docked at McKinley Station, undergoing a major overhaul and refit. I am confident that the ship... and crew... will soon be ready to return to service.
 RIKER is looking over a lot of reports and padds on / the desk. The door CHIMES.
 RIKER / Come in.
 WORF / Phaser upgrades are complete, Commander...
 RIKER / Already?
 WORF / (acknowledges) We have begun power supply calibration.
 RIKER / You're just too damned efficient, Lieutenant...
 WORF / Thank-you, sir.
 RIKER / At this rate, the refit will be done a week early and you and I might even be forced to get in some R&R before we leave Earth...
 RIKER / Proceed with the testing, Mister Worf... (hands him a padd) Here's the final schedule for shore leave and personnel transfers. By the way, I'm looking forward to meeting your parents.
 WORF / Sir?
 RIKER / They're on the visitors' list...
 RIKER / (continuing) You didn't know?
 WORF / No, sir. (beat as he struggles with answer) It is... inappropriate for a Klingon to receive his family while on duty. As humans, my parents do not understand.
 RIKER / Well, I'm not sure I would either, Worf... since this isn't a Klingon ship. If you don't want to see your parents, that's your business... but we don't get to Earth all that often.
 RIKER / I'm sure we can arrange for you to have more off-duty time while they're here.
 WORF / (too quickly) No... sir. That will not be necessary.
 RIKER / (a beat) Dismissed.
 RIKER / Worf, if you're worried they might learn about what happened on the Klingon planet...
 WORF / Not at all, sir. I have already informed them in correspondence of my discommendation. I do not believe any human can truly understand my dishonor.
 PICARD, in civilian clothes, is putting a few / belongings into a small rucksack.
 PICARD / (responding) France. Labarre, my home village...
 TROI / Really...
 PICARD / First time in almost twenty years...
 TROI / (beat) Interesting.
 PICARD / (Don't... ) Counselor...
 TROI / I just find it interesting... that Captain Jean-Luc Picard... the man who couldn't be pried out of his seat for a vacation for three years...
 PICARD / It's Earth... it's home... do I need another reason?
 TROI / I don't know. What do you think?
 PICARD / Counselor, your help has been invaluable during my recovery. I'm better... the injuries have healed...
 TROI / Those you can see in a mirror.
 PICARD / (insisting) The nightmares have ended. All I need is a little time to myself.
 TROI / I agree. In fact, I'm delighted you're going. But perhaps the choice of where you're going could stand some scrutiny.
 PICARD / If you wish to believe my going home is a direct result of being held captive by the Borg, be my guest...
 TROI / Is that what you believe?
 PICARD / I hate it when you do that.
 TROI / (with great compassion) Captain, you do need time. You cannot achieve complete recovery so quickly. Don't expect so much of yourself. It is perfectly normal, after what you've been through, to spend a great deal of time trying to find... yourself again.
 PICARD / (softly, finishing the thought) And what better place to find oneself than on the streets of one's home village.
 TROI / (nods, smiles) Interesting. (beat) Have a good trip.
 WORF / They still have not signalled?
 WORF / (growls) My mother is never on time. It is so... human... of her.
 WORF / I am not looking forward to this... I wish they would come so it would begin and end sooner.
 WORF / Unlikely.
 WORF / I am not concerned about my father chasing nurses.
 WORF / What are you waiting for?
 WORF / Hello, mother... father.
 WORF / No.
 WORF / Let me take you to...
 WORF / I'll show you to your quarters.
 WORF / We are in the midst of repair. I will not be able to give you a complete tour.
 PICARD / All right... whoever's there... I can hear you...
 PICARD / Good lord, a highwayman.
 PICARD / A highwayman is a robber who attacks travelers, but to my knowledge, none have been reported in this vicinity for centuries.
 PICARD / I am much relieved, sir.
 PICARD / Then, you have the advantage.
 PICARD / Then you must be my uncle Rene.
 PICARD / Too bad. I rather enjoyed the idea.
 PICARD / Well, Starfleet keeps me very busy...
 PICARD / I'm sure you misunderstood...
 PICARD / Ah well, Robert and I... we... (beat) Perhaps it's time to change all that.
 PICARD / Arrogant...
 PICARD / (overlapping) Let's talk about it later, shall we?
 PICARD / Marie...
 PICARD / (nods) Just fine.
 PICARD / I was just thinking that I really might be imposing... I could easily stay in the village...
 PICARD / No. In fact, the amazing thing is how little it has changed. Everything is exactly as I remember it... the hills, the house, every rock and stone looks untouched by the passage of time.
 PICARD / As it was to our father.
 PICARD / (grins) Even you, Uncle... you look so much like Robert when he was your age... (and this is more to himself) ... I half expect to see myself as a boy run out the door to play...
 PICARD / (dry) Yes. Rene already told me.
 PICARD / Where is he?
 PICARD / Hello, Robert.
 PICARD / No... I decided to walk. (long beat) I met Marie and Rene.
 PICARD / It's... good to see you.
 BEVERLY is getting a couple of drinks from the food / replicator. Troi is sitting on the couch.
 BEVERLY / Will you have a chance to get down to the surface?
 TROI / Maybe. Will and I have been talking about going back to Angel Falls...
 BEVERLY / Oh, Venezuela's beautiful...
 BEVERLY / Come in.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Oh great! I'll take that.
 TROI / Something from home?
 BEVERLY / (nods and opens the box) I left it here in storage a long time ago. After Jack died. (takes out an old book) Odds and ends mostly...
 TROI / "How to Advance Your Career through Marriage"?
 BEVERLY / (smiling at memory) It's a joke. He sent me that while I was still in medical school. It was his way of proposing.
 TROI / What is it?
 BEVERLY / It's for Wesley... from Jack. (beat) I'd forgotten about it... maybe I was trying to forget about it.
 TROI / Why?
 BEVERLY / Jack recorded a holographic message to Wesley just after he was born... it was a gift for when he grew up. Jack was going to make more of them... (beat) He never got the chance.
 TROI / Are you afraid of what it might say?
 BEVERLY / No... I just don't know if it will do more harm than good. He's managed to finally deal with his father's death, but...
 TROI / Wesley has a lot of questions about his father. Things that you can't answer for him. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / Perhaps seeing this will help him to understand the kind of man that Jack Crusher really was.
 WORF / The older boys were... disrespectful.
 WORF / We've taken enough of the Commander's time...
 GEORDI / No... no... no, we're way ahead of schedule...
 GEORDI / I'd be delighted...
 WORF / Commander La Forge, call me when you... when my father wishes to leave.
 GEORDI / The theta-matrix compositer makes the recrystallization process ten times more efficient than on the Excelsior-class ships.
 GEORDI / Sure, Chief.
 PICARD / Is he still trying to raise the ocean floor?
 PICARD / Oh, it's really quite exciting actually... when you understand the potential of exploring a new world on our own planet...
 PICARD / A parade... ?
 PICARD / No... no...
 PICARD / (a little sharp) No. I don't. I just want... to rest and spend some time with my family.
 PICARD / Thank-you.
 PICARD / (sampling the wine) Is this the forty-six?
 PICARD / Not at all. I believe synthehol heightens one's appreciation for the genuine article.
 PICARD / Leave it to Robert to find the best chef in France and marry her...
 PICARD / I can remember the same "discussions" between mother and father...
 PICARD / I don't see that you have to lose anything... just by adding a convenience...
 PICARD / I was astonished to see it here...
 PICARD / Good for you, uncle. You know what? I wrote a report about starships when I was about your age...
 PICARD / I don't recall...
 PICARD / No, I don't think so.
 PICARD / I am not encouraging anything... but if you weren't so narrow-minded, if you allowed him to see the real world...
 PICARD / Two men. Robert's. And my father's.
 PICARD / No, I was interested, Louis. And I was proud that my family helped to preserve the traditions. But I did not feel bound by those traditions... (beat) ... as they seemed to be.
 PICARD / There should be room for both in this life.
 PICARD / And you, old rascal, you've made quite a shift toward the future yourself...
 PICARD / (laughs) You should have listened to me from the beginning.
 PICARD / And broken your leg!
 PICARD / I hear you've been promoted to supervisor of the Atlantis project...
 PICARD / It's certainly exciting work. I've kept up with it in the journals...
 PICARD / There's only one thing I don't understand... (off Louis' reaction) It's just that you were such a desperately poor swimmer... thinking of you working on the ocean floor...
 PICARD / Seriously, how do you plan to accelerate the buildup on the underside of the mantle without increasing stress on the tectonic plates?
 PICARD / The Enterprise used harmonic resonators to relieve tectonic pressures on Drema Four... it's obviously not exactly the same problem but...
 PICARD / No, I'd never leave Starfleet.
 PICARD / (beat) All right.
 WORF / Mother, Father... I wish you would be a little more... reserved... while you're aboard.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / Go ahead.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I need to talk to you about the phaser test results...
 WORF / (rising) On my way, Commander. (to his parents) Have Guinan call me if you need anything...
 PICARD / Actually... I seem to have made a disturbing discovery...
 PICARD / Louis mentioned the Atlantis project needed a director... and I actually found myself thinking about it.
 PICARD / Do you think so?
 PICARD / Marie, I spent my youth doing everything I could to get away from home...
 PICARD / I can't argue with that.
 PICARD / Well, I already like his choice of wives. I haven't thanked you for your correspondence, it made me feel like part of the family.
 PICARD / Well, there's really nothing to talk about...
 PICARD / I've just really had a chance to glance at them... I have a few ideas but...
 PICARD / A meeting... ?
 PICARD / Preliminary to what?
 PICARD / I never said there was a prospect...
 PICARD / Fine. Good. I'll listen to them.
 WESLEY and Beverly sitting together. Beverly is keyed- / up and trying not to let her feelings show too strongly. Beverly holds the disk in her hand, gripping it tightly. She is positive, trying to be cheerful, but there is an undertone of worry in her voice. Wesley is excited.
 WESLEY / What kind of message?
 BEVERLY / I don't know exactly. Your father made it a few weeks after you were born.
 WESLEY / Why?
 BEVERLY / (hesitates) He thought it was important to say certain things... to make sure that he didn't forget to tell you later.
 WESLEY / Do you know what it says?
 BEVERLY / No. (smiles and gives him disk) He wanted you to have this when you turned eighteen... and I want you to have it too.
 WORF / Enter.
 WORF / No. I thought you were going to your quarters to sleep.
 WORF / When I heard you were on the visitors' list, I was... not sure I wanted you to come. (he looks up) I am glad you are here.
 WORF / My reasons can never be told.
 WORF / I must bear my dishonor alone.
 PICARD / That is so.
 PICARD / What's that?
 PICARD / I have nothing but pity for those who abuse any substance.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / Is that "brotherly" concern?
 PICARD / You know what happened.
 PICARD / I don't want to do this with you...
 PICARD / I'm tired of fighting with you, Robert...
 PICARD / That's right.
 PICARD / I am not a hero...
 PICARD / That isn't true.
 PICARD / I've never sought recognition...
 PICARD / Were you so jealous?
 PICARD / (scorn) A right...
 PICARD / Why didn't you break a few rules?
 PICARD / You were a bully...
 PICARD / Try it again.
 PICARD / You were asking for it, you know.
 PICARD / You don't know, Robert. You don't know. They took everything I was. They used me to kill and destroy. And I could not stop them. I should have been able to stop them.
 PICARD / I tried... I tried... so hard... but I just wasn't strong enough. Not good enough. I should have been able to stop them. I should have been able to...
 PICARD / You know, I think you were right. (off Robert's look) Maybe I did come back so you'd look after me.
 PICARD / It's entirely my fault, Marie...
 PICARD / We both fell together...
 PICARD / He'd probably send us to bed without our supper.
 PICARD / Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps it was. (beat) I'll contact Louis and cancel the meeting with the Board of Governors. It's time for me to be going...
 PICARD / The ship will be ready to leave orbit soon... and I belong on board. (beat, then to Robert) If I ever doubt that again... I know where to come.
 PICARD / I'm sorry. I must.
 WESLEY / Computer, load program, Crusher One.
 WESLEY / (softly) Run program.
 WESLEY / (a hoarse whisper) Good-bye, Dad.
 PICARD / Take care, Uncle.
 PICARD / (gently) There's plenty of time for that... keep your mind open... you may decide to do something else as you get older. (tinge of irony) Try not to be so... narrow-minded.
 WORF / No...
 WORF / (continuing) Perhaps some of your rokeg blood pie...
 WORF / (surprised) Captain... welcome back.
 PICARD / Thank you, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Captain, these are my parents. Sergey and Helena Rozhenko.
 PICARD / Delighted.
 PICARD / You got the full tour, I trust...
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Chief Medical Officer's log, Stardate 44161.2. We are docked at Starbase One-Three-Three for scheduled crew rotation. I look forward to welcoming aboard my mentor, and dear friend, Doctor Dalen Quaice, who will be traveling with us to his home planet, Kenda Two.
 BEVERLY stands waiting patiently. O'BRIEN is at the / console. A quite elderly man in a Starfleet uniform MATERIALIZES on the Transporter pad: DALEN QUAICE. He carries a small bag. As he steps slowly off the pad, Beverly moves to embrace him.
 BEVERLY / Dalen!
 BEVERLY / You look wonderful.
 BEVERLY / It's on our way. (to O'Brien) Thank you, Chief.
 BEVERLY / Dalen, I was sorry to hear about Patricia.
 BEVERLY / Is her death the reason you're giving up your post here?
 BEVERLY / Jack and I didn't have a lifetime, only a few short years. But I understand. When you realize someone you love is lost forever...
 WESLEY is immersed in work at a computer as GEORDI and / a couple of SUPERNUMERARIES make final preparations for departure.
 GEORDI / Wes, time for the experiment is over... I want my warp engines back. Now.
 WESLEY / (working furiously) Almost done, Commander.
 GEORDI / Almost isn't good enough. You want to explain when the Captain says "Engage," and we just sit here?
 WESLEY / Just a couple more minutes! I'm ready to try the new warp field! (sees Beverly) Mom?
 BEVERLY / (pensive) Don't let me interrupt.
 WESLEY / (on the fly) Hi!
 GEORDI / Wes!
 WESLEY / Right! Okay!
 GEORDI / Computer, level two diagnostic on warp drive systems.
 GEORDI / Talk to me.
 WESLEY / (stunned) That shouldn't have happened.
 GEORDI / Ensign Crusher --
 WESLEY / Why would there be any visible phenomena outside the drive?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Umbilical disconnect.
 GEORDI / Are you done?
 WESLEY / Uh, yeah...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Clear all moorings. Engineering, aft thrusters.
 GEORDI / Aft thrusters, aye. Impulse power to the helm.
 BEVERLY / Dalen? (no reply) Dalen, it's Beverly.
 BEVERLY / Computer, current location of Doctor Dalen Quaice.
 WORF / Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant Worf, yesterday, before we left starbase an old friend of mine came onboard: Doctor Dalen Quaice. I requested quarters for him. He was assigned here.
 WORF / I was not aware of this passenger.
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry. I thought it was standard procedure for you to be notified once Captain Picard approved passage.
 WORF / It is. Please proceed.
 BEVERLY / We were to meet for breakfast. But I can't seem to find him... or any of his things...
 WORF / Computer, where is Doctor Dalen Quaice?
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant, Doctor Quaice is very old, and rather frail. If he fell somewhere... if his communicator were damaged...
 WORF / I will order a search immediately.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 WORF / Even if Doctor Quaice had been injured... why would his belongings be missing?
 PICARD is seated at his desk. Facing him are DATA, / Worf and Beverly.
 WORF / Sir, I have several teams conducting a deck-by-deck search. It is not yet complete.
 DATA / I have scanned the entire ship, Captain. Other than the Enterprise's regular complement, I can find no one else onboard.
 BEVERLY / (fearing the worst) Your sensors wouldn't detect him... if he were dead...
 DATA / That is correct, Doctor.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Could your friend have returned to the starbase without telling you? An emergency of some sort?
 BEVERLY / There were a lot of people going back and forth between the ship and the starbase yesterday.
 DATA / We can easily check the transporter I.D. traces.
 PICARD / By all means check the trace log. But even if the results are negative, contact Starbase Command. We should leave nothing to chance.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Doctor, one moment please. (she turns back) I'm sure you are aware of procedures involving passengers.
 BEVERLY / Of course. I don't know why Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about Doctor Quaice.
 PICARD / I was not informed either.
 BEVERLY / (startled) But I sent in a request weeks ago.
 PICARD / I never received it.
 BEVERLY / I'm sure I had a confirmation.
 PICARD / Computer, search passenger requests. Doctor Dalen Quaice. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Point of embarkation: Starbase One-Three-Three.
 BEVERLY / Captain, I sent in that request. And it was approved.
 PICARD / Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me.
 BEVERLY / And someone else sent the approval? Why?
 PICARD / Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time?
 BEVERLY / Six years.
 PICARD / It might be prudent to find out if he'd acquired any enemies there.
 RIKER / On course for Durenia Four, sir.
 PICARD / Very good, Number One. Mister Data?
 DATA / Sir, Starbase One-Three-Three has no record at all of a Doctor Dalen Quaice.
 PICARD / I thought he was stationed there for six years.
 DATA / Not according to their computer. I have also accessed Starfleet records. There is no doctor currently serving in Starfleet named Quaice. In fact I cannot find any service record whatsoever. There are no birth records with that name. I find no --
 BEVERLY / Data, I interned with him on Delos Four. I've known him for fifteen years.
 DATA / I do not doubt you, Doctor. However I have tried one hundred seventy-three phonetic variations of the name, and --
 BEVERLY / His name is Dalen Quaice. Q-U-A-I-C-E. Whatever the records say, they're wrong.
 PICARD / Mister Worf?
 WORF / Captain, we have completed our search. We cannot locate Doctor Quaice.
 RIKER / You're not alone.
 BEVERLY / He was onboard. I met him in Transporter Room Three myself.
 PICARD / Then it appears, for reasons unknown, someone has gone to great pains to erase all traces of this man.
 RIKER / (to Beverly) Who was on transporter duty when he came aboard?
 RIKER / No. He's a friend of Doctor Crusher's.
 BEVERLY / Sixteen hundred hours yesterday.
 BEVERLY / Yes. I was here to greet him. An elderly man? Not in the best of health?
 BEVERLY / Was he invisible? Did I carry on a conversation with thin air?
 BEVERLY / I can't accept that Chief O'Brien might be lying...
 RIKER / He believes what he says. And there is no trace imprint for Doctor Quaice.
 BEVERLY / Will, I didn't conjure up one of my best friends from a test tube.
 RIKER / If the ship's records have been tampered with, then the transporter records could have been changed as well.
 BEVERLY / And with everybody coming and going yesterday, maybe O'Brien just doesn't remember, or...
 RIKER / Or?
 BEVERLY / It might be a good idea to run a diagnostic on him.
 RIKER / To make sure he hasn't been tampered with?
 BEVERLY / What do you think?
 RIKER / It's worth a try.
 RIKER / I'll check the replicator activity logs -- eighteen hours is a long time to go without food. Or without someone seeing him.
 BEVERLY / Chief, this examination should only take a few minutes.
 BEVERLY / (to Nurse) Things are awfully quiet around here. Is everybody really that healthy?
 BEVERLY / We should still have a full staff on duty.
 BEVERLY / Sit down, over here...
 BEVERLY / (indicates examination table) I'll be a little more comprehensive than that, Chief. (keys communicator) Crusher to Doctor Hill. (nothing) Respond please. Doctor Selar, what is your present location? (silence) Computer, current whereabouts of Doctors Hill and Selar.
 BEVERLY / Your husband: Doctor Richard Hill...
 BEVERLY / Of course you are. Your husband is my staff osteopath. You came onboard together six months ago.
 BEVERLY / Doctors Hill and Selar, and four other members of my medical staff have all vanished. All record of their ever having been on the Enterprise has been excised from the computer's memory.
 PICARD / Did they come aboard with Doctor Quaice?
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head) No. They've been here for months. But the two duty nurses don't remember them. Their families don't even remember them...
 PICARD / As O'Brien didn't remember Doctor Quaice... ?
 BEVERLY / (nods) I checked O'Brien thoroughly. I found no physiological abnormalities.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Ensign.
 WESLEY / I'm in Engineering, sir. I think there's something here you'd better see. It might be connected to Doctor Quaice's disappearance.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / On my way.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Number One, any progress?
 RIKER / (shakes his head) No one's seen him. The replicator in his quarters hasn't been used.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Check shield and hull integrity for any sign of intruders...
 WORF / Yessir... but I have been closely monitoring onboard sensors... there has been no indication...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Then give me a Level One diagnostic of all onboard sensors, and run a manual sweep for any anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. I want some answers.
 WESLEY / I've been experimenting with Kosinski's warp field equations... Trying to find a way to improve engine efficiency.
 PICARD / (nods) I've read your reports.
 GEORDI / We did a test run while we were at the starbase.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Here's what the computer recorded.
 WESLEY / This is the static warp field we created inside the warp drive. The experiment was designed to see if we could keep a bubble like this intact.
 GEORDI / As you'll see in a moment, we couldn't.
 GEORDI / There was a momentary flash of light. It was all over the spectrum.
 BEVERLY / I remember that.
 PICARD / Are you suggesting this bubble could have made Doctor Quaice disappear?
 WESLEY / If he were caught in it... yessir, it would seem to us like he'd disappeared.
 BEVERLY / Where would he go?
 GEORDI / (sighs) Who knows... he could even end up outside our space-time continuum...
 PICARD / Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering during your experiment?
 GEORDI / No, sir.
 PICARD / And this bubble never expanded beyond Engineering?
 WESLEY / Nossir.
 PICARD / Then how could it have trapped Doctor Quaice or the others?
 WESLEY / Other people are missing?
 BEVERLY / Yes, and they weren't anywhere near Engineering either.
 WESLEY / (shakes his head) It doesn't make sense.
 PICARD / And I doubt warp bubbles could alter computer records, or erase memories. (beat) Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La Forge. It's the only working theory we have for now.
 PICARD / Has something else happened?
 BEVERLY / Sickbay is totally empty. Apparently I no longer have any staff.
 RIKER / And that surprises you, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (stares at him) Surprises me? I'll say it surprises me! There should be at least four members of my staff on duty at all times.
 DATA / I am afraid the ship's records do not concur.
 BEVERLY / What are you talking about?
 DATA / You do not have a staff.
 BEVERLY / You're telling me I'm the sole medical officer on a ship with over a thousand people on board?!
 DATA / Excuse me, Doctor, but the entire ship's complement is two hundred thirty.
 BEVERLY / No. That's wrong! Whatever is happening is affecting your memories, too.
 PICARD / Doctor, may I see you in my Ready Room?
 PICARD / Beverly, you're saying this ship has lost nearly eight hundred of its personnel... ?
 BEVERLY / I know how it must sound...
 PICARD / None of the scans reveal any anomalies... there is no sign of an intruder... Wesley's experiment clearly did not have the scope to affect an entire starship...
 BEVERLY / The Enterprise is in serious danger. You must believe me...
 PICARD / I have no choice but to believe you. The safety of my crew is at stake. But I want to be sure...
 BEVERLY / That I haven't lost my mind?
 BEVERLY / I just examined myself... being the only doctor on board, I had to do it myself... there is no sign of dysfunction... yes, there's an elevation of adrenalin which I think is understandable...
 PICARD / Did you find anything that might suggest why you're apparently the only one among us unaffected by this... phenomenon?
 BEVERLY / No. (meets his eyes) I'll talk to Troi.
 PICARD / It wouldn't do any harm.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, please... return to Starbase One-Three-Three for a full diagnostic. I realize you have only my word to convince you...
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Mister Riker, set a course to return to Starbase One-Three-Three immediately.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Your word has always been good enough for me.
 GEORDI / I've had a team in Sickbay for two hours. We've run the mass spectrometer on all particulates... we've scanned the EM spectrum in case a wave guide was somehow leaking radiation... we've even crawled into the life support ductwork... Captain, I don't know what this vortex was that Doctor Crusher saw...
 BEVERLY / I didn't just see it. I felt it. I barely got away from it!
 GEORDI / Well, there's nothing there now. And no sign there ever was.
 PICARD / Is there any possible connection to Mister Crusher's experiment... could this warp bubble be... floating around the ship perhaps...
 GEORDI / No, sir. The bubble was definitely contained in Engineering. There's no way it could affect something up on Deck Twelve.
 DATA / Sir, I have completed level-1 computer diagnostics. There are no malfunctions.
 RIKER / Any other ships respond to our queries, Data?
 DATA / The Wellington is the only Federation vessel in this sector... it reports normal operations. A Ferengi ship within communications range also reports nothing unusual.
 RIKER / Have external sensors detected anything out of the ordinary?
 DATA / The interstellar medium in this sector is slightly denser than average. However, all readings are well within normal parameters.
 BEVERLY / Are all members of the crew accounted for?
 DATA / Yes, doctor.
 BEVERLY / How many are there?
 DATA / There are one hundred fourteen people on the Enterprise.
 DATA / That is the exact number there should be.
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head) There are now close to nine hundred missing.
 BEVERLY / (explodes) Deck after deck of this ship is now deserted. How do you explain all the empty rooms? If only a hundred fourteen people are supposed to be on board, why all the extra space?
 DATA / (rattling off logical explanations) Transportation of colonists... diplomatic missions... emergency evacuations...
 PICARD / (enough) Thank you, Mister Data.
 PICARD / Have security confine all nonessential personnel to their quarters. Computer, Red Alert.
 BEVERLY / Sir, I'd like Lieutenant Worf to program onboard sensors to monitor all personnel... if we can catch the exact moment someone disappears...
 PICARD / (gives her a blank stare) Whom did you say?
 BEVERLY / Worf... chief of security... the big guy who never smiles... Klingon?
 BEVERLY / Deanna?
 BEVERLY / I need you to tell me if I've gone completely mad.
 TROI / (smiles) If you can ask the question, I'd say no.
 BEVERLY / Don't evade the question.
 TROI / (sympathetically) Then ask me one I can answer.
 BEVERLY / Deanna, I've delivered babies who no longer exist! No one else remembers them. But I can close my eyes, and see their faces as clearly as I can see yours! What if it isn't some huge conspiracy?! What if it's just me?!
 TROI / What if it is just you?
 BEVERLY / Then, I've delayed a mission, scared a lot of people... including me...
 TROI / So what? (beat) Beverly, you've acted in the best interests of your ship and crew. What more could you ask of yourself? If it turns out to be a... mistake... we'll be a little late to Durenia Four... that's all.
 BEVERLY / It's not a mistake... I wish it were...
 TROI / When we reach Starbase, I'll order a complete workup: both physical and psychological.
 BEVERLY / If we reach Starbase. (beat) Wesley... where's Wesley... ?
 BEVERLY / Wesley!!
 WESLEY / Mom? You all right?
 BEVERLY / No. (beat) We may have very little time left...
 BEVERLY / You don't believe me...
 WESLEY / I don't know, Mom...
 BEVERLY / I don't have time to convince you. Hundreds of people are gone and your experiment is the only possible explanation we have to work on right now...
 WESLEY / There it is. I don't know what else to do...
 BEVERLY / Then find someone who does... someone who knows more about... about warp bubbles...
 WESLEY / (overlapping) I've already talked to Kosinski on subspace... he can't explain it either and it's all based on his equations. There is someone who might be able to help us, but I can't reach him.
 BEVERLY / Who?
 WESLEY / He was Kosinski's assistant... an alien from Tau Alpha C... He said he was a "Traveler"... somehow he combined warp technology with the energy of his own thoughts...
 BEVERLY / (thoughtful) Yes, I remember... he took us where thoughts and reality became indistinguishable... (beat) Wesley, is it possible you've accidentally re-created something he did? Something that could alter reality?
 WESLEY / I don't see how. But he's the only one who could tell us... I've sent a message by subspace, but Tau Alpha C is so far away, it'll take days to get there.
 BEVERLY / (pulling him along) Maybe the Captain can help us... We've got to find him. Come on...
 WESLEY / I don't even know if he's still alive. He was sick.
 BEVERLY / Wesley, it's a chance, we have to...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) -- try it...
 BEVERLY / Nooooo... !
 BEVERLY / (calm) They're all gone... ?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Riker, Troi, Data... let me guess -- you've never heard of any of them.
 PICARD / (anger growing) Doctor, I believe I have been more than fair. I have done everything I can to substantiate your... your perceptions --
 BEVERLY / Will Riker! Your First Officer. He's very good at poker, likes to cook, listen to jazz, plays the trombone...
 PICARD / I cannot find any evidence...
 BEVERLY / (not to be interrupted) ... Commander Data, the android who sits here at Ops, dreams of being human, never gets the punch line to a joke... ?
 PICARD / ... Beverly, we'll be arriving at Starbase One-Three-Three in a few hours...
 BEVERLY / ... Deanna Troi, you ship's counselor, half-Betazoid, loves chocolate, the arrival of her mother makes you shudder? And Geordi, O'Brien, Worf... Wesley, my son -- They have been the living, breathing heart of this crew for over three years. They deserve better than to be shrugged off... brushed aside... to be pinched out of existence like this! (a deep breath) They all do. All nine hundred. They deserve so much more...
 PICARD / Perhaps you should confine yourself to Sickbay until we arrive...
 BEVERLY / It's perfectly logical to you. The two of us roaming about the galaxy in the flagship of the Federation. No crew at all.
 PICARD / We've never needed a crew before.
 BEVERLY / I don't suppose you remember an alien from Tau Alpha C who was once onboard... called himself a Traveler... ?
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, I don't know how, but you and I must find this Traveler or another from his race... if anyone can help us...
 PICARD / You have my word... as soon as we return to the starbase, I'll make every effort to find him.
 BEVERLY / This isn't a delusion. It isn't a dream. There is a physical, measurable phenomenon at work. (beat, an idea) Maybe you can help me identify it...
 PICARD / How?
 BEVERLY / I'd like to use the ship's computer to monitor your life functions.
 PICARD / Until I disappear.
 BEVERLY / It will happen.
 PICARD / Very well. Computer, continuous scan: Captain Jean-Luc Picard vital signs. Audible readout. Begin now.
 BEVERLY / I promise you I'll continue to do whatever I can to figure out what's happening, and to bring you all back. (beat) I'm sorry I lost my temper. You do remember that?
 PICARD / Vividly. But if I have forgotten my closest friends and comrades, as you say, I deserved every word.
 BEVERLY / For quite awhile now there's something I've been meaning to say to you. I may not get another chance. Jean-Luc, you and I --
 BEVERLY / I won't forget. I won't forget any of you!
 GEORDI / I'll try the secondary equations!
 WESLEY / No, it's too late. Look.
 WESLEY / I've lost it.
 GEORDI / I'm sorry, Wesley.
 WESLEY / It's over. We'll never get her back.
 TRAVELER (O.C.) / It's not over, Wesley.
 TRAVELER / (continuing) There's still a way.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44162.5. Two attempts to retrieve Doctor Crusher have failed. And now the Traveler, a mysterious visitor from our past, has reappeared.
 WESLEY / And then I sent a message by subspace to Tau Alpha C asking for help... but I didn't think it would reach there for days...
 TRAVELER / Actually, it didn't reach me... not by subspace...
 GEORDI / Then how did you know about the warp bubble?
 TRAVELER / It would take too long to explain...
 PICARD / (impatient) Is she alive?
 TRAVELER / (reassuring, authoritative) As long as she thinks she is alive, she is alive.
 RIKER / What the hell does that mean?
 TRAVELER / (sighs with controlled frustration) Your species have very narrow perceptions of time and space and thought. (beat, trying to make it simple) When Beverly Crusher was caught in the static warp bubble, she created her own reality. Her thoughts at the precise moment she was trapped determined its shape and form.
 TROI / Can you go in and get her back?
 TRAVELER / No, it is her reality. I cannot enter it... any more than I can enter her thoughts.
 WESLEY / But you said there's still a way.
 TRAVELER / I can help, but I can't do it myself. Wesley, there is a power within each of us that most people haven't begun to realize... you have, or I would not have known to come here now... (beat, dramatically) Together, we may be able to open a gateway for her. But she must choose to walk through it.
 BEVERLY / Computer, we're going to apply precise diagnostic methodology. Once we've cataloged the symptoms, we'll proceed to determine the illness, and find a cure. (considers) We'll start with the assumption that I'm not crazy... if I am, it won't matter one way or the other...
 BEVERLY / Computer, read the entire crew roster for the Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / Have I always been the only member of the crew on the Starship Enterprise?
 BEVERLY / (not serious) If this was a bad dream, would you tell me?
 BEVERLY / What date did I report on board?
 BEVERLY / That sounds about right. (beat) Computer, is there more than one U.S.S. Enterprise?
 BEVERLY / What is the primary mission of the Starship Enterprise?
 BEVERLY / Do I have the necessary skills to complete that mission alone?
 BEVERLY / Then why am I the only crew member? (a beat) Aha, gotcha there...
 BEVERLY / Computer, are you familiar with the inhabitants of Tau Alpha C?
 BEVERLY / Are any presently located on a starbase or vessel within communication range?
 BEVERLY / Estimated time to Tau Alpha C at warp nine-point-five...
 BEVERLY / (beat, deciding) Lay in a new course for Tau Alpha C. And send them a subspace message advising our arrival.
 BEVERLY / Engage.
 BEVERLY / Computer, did you change course?
 BEVERLY / I stated it, dammit... Tau Alpha C...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44162.8. At the direction of the Traveler, the Enterprise is returning to Starbase One-Three-Three and the precise position where the subspace bubble was formed.
 TRAVELER / Our goal will be to create a stable gateway between our reality and your mother's reality...
 WESLEY / We've tried to stabilize it. The link won't hold.
 TRAVELER / Of course not. The equations are only the first step. We will be going beyond mathematics.
 WESLEY / Just tell me what I have to do.
 TRAVELER / It's nothing I can tell you, Wesley...
 WESLEY / (frustrated) Then how am I supposed to do it? (off the Traveler's even stare) You said you'd help.
 TRAVELER / You must allow me to help.
 WESLEY / I don't know how.
 TRAVELER / Begin by letting go of your guilt, Wesley.
 WESLEY / It was my fault. I should never have tried...
 TRAVELER / (interrupting) Focus on the present. You will have to be here... completely... to help her back. You must open yourself to time and space and the intricate threads that bind them.
 TRAVELER / Begin entering your warp field equations...
 TRAVELER / Close your eyes.
 TRAVELER / Continue to enter the equations...
 WESLEY / I don't have any more equations.
 TRAVELER / See past the numbers. Trust yourself...
 WESLEY / I can't. I can't do it.
 TRAVELER / When the time comes, you will, Wesley. You will. Now, begin again...
 BEVERLY / Starbase One-Three-Three, this is the Enterprise. (no response) Starbase One-Three-Three, this is the Enterprise. Please acknowledge. (beat) Viewscreen on.
 BEVERLY / It's not just people... Everything is disappearing!
 BEVERLY / Computer, what is that... mist... I'm seeing?
 BEVERLY / It surrounds the ship?
 BEVERLY / (to herself) If there isn't anything wrong with me... maybe there's something wrong with the universe... Computer, what is beyond the mass-energy field?
 BEVERLY / Computer, here's a question you shouldn't be able to answer... What is the nature of the universe?
 DATA / Approaching Starbase One-Three- Three, Captain...
 PICARD / Slow to ten meters per second.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, prepare for precision station-keeping.
 GEORDI / Acknowledged. Readying thrusters.
 TRAVELER / There... there it is...
 TRAVELER / We're moving into phase now (tech)... there's your warp bubble, Wesley...
 WESLEY / What? What's wrong.
 TRAVELER / It's collapsing.
 BEVERLY / Computer, give me a graphic representation of the universe.
 BEVERLY / (reacts) I've seen that before... (beat) Wesley's experiment... the bubble. Of course... But that would mean I'm the one trapped in the bubble...
 BEVERLY / Computer, what's happening?
 BEVERLY / Cause?
 BEVERLY / (this is a new one) Show me.
 BEVERLY / Analysis... ?
 BEVERLY / Superimpose the previous image over this one. Same scale. And continue to monitor.
 BEVERLY / (realizing) It's collapsing...
 BEVERLY / How long can life support be maintained?
 DATA / Sir, we have reestablished the exact coordinates and attitude.
 RIKER / (to com) Geordi, we're in position... your status?
 GEORDI / The warp bubble is contracting at a rate of fifteen meters per second... we'll lose it in about four minutes...
 TRAVELER / (calm) It's time, Wesley.
 GEORDI / (to com) We're ready, Commander.
 RIKER / Proceed.
 PICARD / I'll be in Engineering.
 TRAVELER / Let it go, Wesley... let go of the anticipation... the expectations... the demands upon yourself... let it all go... leave it behind.
 TRAVELER / Yes. The ability is there... inside you... you don't need to look for it...
 BEVERLY / (to herself, quick pace, pressing herself to complete equation) The Traveler used his thoughts to alter warp fields... and thoughts became reality... Now I'm in a warp field... (beat) Could my thoughts have changed this reality?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Come on, Beverly! What's the next step?! (an idea) What was I thinking at the moment Wesley's bubble formed? Dalen Quaice... He said... all the people he'd known were gone... I thought of Jack... I went to see Wesley... the flash in Engineering... And that's when it started... when I started losing everybody! (lightbulb) My thoughts created this universe. Can they get me out of it again?
 BEVERLY / I'm not talking to you. (beat) Click my heels together three times and I'm back in Kansas? Can it be that simple?
 BEVERLY / (continuing; frowns) No, it can't be that simple.
 BEVERLY / Computer, hypothetical situation... a person is trapped inside a static warp bubble. Determine a means of escape...
 BEVERLY / Can you describe this threshold?
 BEVERLY / Extrapolate from theoretical database. How might it manifest itself?
 BEVERLY / Disturbance? The vortex! They must have been trying to reach me! But how do I find it... ? Wesley, where do I go? Help me...
 BEVERLY / Stable threshold... They've been trying to create a stable threshold. Where are they trying to do it? (the final piece of the puzzle) Where did they do it the first time? Engineering!
 BEVERLY / Engineering!
 BEVERLY / Just get me anywhere on Deck Thirty-Six!
 GEORDI / We're losing the bubble...
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc... (sees the Traveler, reacts) You...
 BEVERLY / Do I have you to thank for getting me back?
 TRAVELER / No.
 BEVERLY / Captain, if I may ask: how many people are there onboard?
 PICARD / (surprised) One thousand fourteen, including your guest, Doctor Quaice.
 GEORDI / Is there something wrong with that count?
 BEVERLY / (smiles) No. That's the exact number there should be.
 RIKER, DATA, TROI and WORF are playing five-card draw / poker, Riker dealing. Riker and Data have similarly large piles of chips in front of them. It looks like Troi and Worf are down to mortgaging the farm. Worf stares at his hand -- his poker face leaves a lot to be desired.
 WORF / (scowls) One.
 RIKER / (baiting him) Worf. Are you trying to fill another inside straight?
 RIKER / (continuing) Don't say I didn't warn you.
 WORF / Pah.
 TROI / (to Riker) I fold.
 DATA / I will raise you three.
 RIKER / No cards?
 RIKER / (to others) Best poker face I've ever seen.
 RIKER / Dealer takes two.
 RIKER / (continuing) Raise you ten.
 DATA / I will see your bet, and raise you twenty.
 RIKER / Data. Are you sitting on a full house or a flush?
 DATA / It will cost you twenty to make that determination, Sir.
 RIKER / Dealer folds.
 TROI / (teasingly) You two have successfully split the evening between yourselves.
 WORF / I suspect conspiracy. But far be it for me to accuse my superior officers.
 RIKER / It's getting harder to bluff you, Data. You've learned this game well.
 DATA / Yes sir, I believe I have.
 RIKER / Tell you what.
 RIKER / (continuing) I'll bet you I can find a card that you bury anywhere in this deck. And furthermore, I'll make you help me do it.
 TROI / Careful, Data.
 DATA / Your guidance is much valued, Counsellor. However...
 RIKER / Don't let me see it.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Now lose it in the deck.
 RIKER / Cut the deck into two halves.
 RIKER / (continuing) Again.
 RIKER / (continuing) Once more.
 RIKER / (continuing) How many cards are left?
 DATA / Eleven.
 RIKER / Pick five.
 RIKER / (continuing) Throw them away.
 RIKER / (continuing) Choose three.
 RIKER / (continuing) Now pick one of those.
 RIKER / (continuing) Turn it over.
 RIKER / (knowing the answer) Is that your card?
 TROI / Incredible.
 DATA / You surreptitiously placed the edge of your left thumb onto the card immediately after I inserted it back into the deck. When you divided the deck to reshuffle, you kept that card on top. You thus were able to have me either discard or save depending on the card's location, which you followed at each step. Until we were left with one -- the card I originally chose.
 DATA / Sir, I think under the circumstances...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Riker.
 RIKER / (to com) Captain?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We've received a distress call. Changing course to intercept...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44215.2. The Enterprise has bypassed its scheduled archaelogical survey of Camus Two in response to a distress call from a Federation freighter. The Arcos has assumed an emergency orbit around Turkana Four, birthplace of our late comrade Tasha Yar.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF and TROI at their stations. / A supernumerary is at the Conn.
 DATA / We will enter the Turkana system in eleven minutes, Captain.
 PICARD / Engine status.
 DATA / Stable. But we have maintained warp factor nine for longer than is recommended.
 WORF / Subspace message from the Arcos. Their transmitter is failing, sir. Audio only.
 PICARD / Let's hear it.
 PICARD / Warp nine-point-three, Ensign.
 PICARD / How much time?
 DATA / Seven minutes and fifteen seconds will bring us within transporter range.
 PICARD / Go to warp nine-point-six.
 DATA / Entering the Turkana System, Captain.
 PICARD / (to com) Mister O'Brien, prepare to lock onto the two crewmen.
 PICARD / Drop to impulse.
 DATA / Visual contact.
 RIKER / (to com) Get them out of there, O'Brien.
 RIKER / O'Brien, status!
 DATA / I am reading an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod.
 WORF / (to Picard) Unable to establish contact.
 PICARD / It could have been damaged by the explosion. They may have been incapable of maintaining orbit.
 RIKER / Let's hope they stay clear of the colony.
 DATA / That is exactly where the ion trail leads, Commander.
 PICARD / Hail the colony.
 WORF / I've been trying to, Captain... No response.
 RIKER / (to Picard) There haven't been reliable communications since the government fell apart.
 DATA / The last Federation vessel to attempt contact was the Potemkin six years ago. They were warned that anyone transporting down to the colony would be killed.
 PICARD / Ready your away team, Number One.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit above Turkana Four, an Earth colony that severed relations with the Federation nearly fifteen years ago. I am concerned about sending an away team, but if we are to discover the fate of the two missing Federation crewmen, I see no alternative.
 DATA / The surface settlement appears to be all but destroyed. Sensors show that the colonists now live in structures that extend nearly three kilometers beneath the city.
 RIKER / Have you located the escape pod's landing point, Chief?
 WORF / (re: Beverly) Sir, we can anticipate a violent response to our presence. (MORE)
 WORF (Cont'd) / Perhaps the Doctor should wait here for our signal.
 BEVERLY / (an edge) I appreciate the concern. But I think it's exaggerated.
 WORF / Doctor, the colony is completely lawless. Lieutenant Yar spoke of rape gangs...
 BEVERLY / Mister Worf, I can handle myself.
 RIKER / (a decision) She's coming. The Arcos crewmen may require immediate medical assistance.
 RIKER / Phasers on maximum stun.
 RIKER / (continuing) Energize.
 DATA / The dispersion trail continues in this direction.
 DATA / (continuing) The concentration gradient definitely increases along this vector.
 DATA / (continuing) The escape pod was apparently moved into the tunnels ahead of us.
 RIKER / Not the response we expected.
 BEVERLY / Maybe things have changed here.
 RIKER / We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We tracked two crewmen to this area. Do you know anything about them?
 RIKER / What do you mean?
 WORF / (to Riker, re: the glow) Proximity detectors. I've seen them used on Manu Three.
 RIKER / Come on.
 RIKER / The Alliance?
 RIKER / Maybe it would be easier if I contacted the authorities.
 RIKER / Are you offering to help?
 WORF / That is no better than a ransom demand.
 RIKER / Everything we've seen suggests otherwise.
 WORF / Then why do you need more phasers?
 BEVERLY / You keep using the word "peace." We've heard a different version of life on Turkana Four.
 DATA / A former crewmember was born here.
 DATA / She was killed in the line of duty.
 RIKER / We'll return to the Enterprise and consider your proposal.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. Energize.
 RIKER / (re: the bottle) According to Hayne, the Coalition and the Alliance raid each other for supplies -- much of it non-essential.
 PICARD / Why?
 WORF / A battle exercise.
 RIKER / (nodding) Their defenses apparently prevent deep strikes into each other's territory. Minor skirmishes are all that's left.
 PICARD / "Coalition", "Alliance" -- it all sounds so reasonable. But you've described the behavior of urban street thugs. We certainly won't trade weapons for the crewmen. (beat) How do you suggest we deal with them?
 RIKER / We have to tell them something.
 WORF / No promises. No denials.
 PICARD / (nods in agreement) For now, Hayne's Coalition is our only safe access to the colony. Let's keep the door open and see where it leads.
 WORF / Captain. Transmission from Turkana Four. Coming in on a secure channel.
 PICARD / (surprised) On screen.
 PICARD / (to Hayne) I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / With nothing from us in return?
 PICARD / What do you propose?
 PICARD / One moment.
 WORF / Mute.
 PICARD / Reactions?
 WORF / I do not trust him.
 RIKER / She could be a fake. We mentioned that a former member of the crew had come from the colony.
 BEVERLY / (nodding) All Hayne had to do was search through whatever their database had on Starfleet to come up with Tasha's name.
 PICARD / Counsellor?
 TROI / He's being deceptive, and he's clearly hoping to manipulate us. As for the young woman's identity, I can't tell.
 PICARD / Regardless, this is an option we cannot neglect. We'll continue on other fronts as they present themselves. For now, let's see what she has to say.
 WORF / Open.
 PICARD / I've decided to accept your proposal.
 DATA / Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara. I am Commander Data.
 DATA / I am an android.
 DATA / (reacts) On what do you base that assumption?
 DATA / The Enterprise is not a ship of war. It is a ship of exploration.
 DATA / My orders are to escort you to the Observation Lounge. We will proceed from there.
 DATA / Your sister never spoke of you.
 DATA / It is surprising to me. Tasha and I spent much time together in the course of our duties. We had a considerable number of conversations.
 DATA / Only to say that she was lucky to have escaped.
 DATA / "Cowardice" is a term that I have never heard applied to Tasha.
 DATA / No. It is just that for a moment, the expression on your face was reminiscent of your sister.
 PICARD / We have considered that possibility.
 BEVERLY / Thank you, I will.
 PICARD / Please. Sit down.
 PICARD / Perhaps it would help if you gave us some idea of what we're dealing with on Turkana Four. Our last information describes a colony in complete disarray.
 RIKER / The Coalition and the Alliance are all that's left?
 PICARD / Apparently, that part of the plan didn't succeed very well.
 GEORDI / Tasha left you in the middle of all that?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Incoming transmission from the colony, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 BEVERLY / (to screen) Ask them if we can at least send a medical --
 GEORDI / If I could get to the myographic scanner...
 DATA / A sensing device on the escape pod. It monitors the bio-electric signatures of the crew. In the event they get separated from the pod.
 GEORDI / I could install a booster on the device that would relay its signals to the Enterprise. Then we could track the men from up here.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, we don't know where the escape pod is.
 RIKER / (pointing) We could transport an away team right into this intersection...
 WORF / We'll need a diversion.
 GEORDI / Transport a couple of photon grenades into the adjoining chambers. At minimum intensity it wouldn't kill anybody, just shake them up a lot.
 RIKER / That won't give us enough time. We need something that'll occupy them long enough for you to install the relay.
 RIKER / Too dangerous. We've seen what those tunnels look like. You could easily be cut off from the rest of us. (to Worf) Worf, if we --
 DATA / She would have to be armed, Commander.
 RIKER / I want to discuss this with the Captain. (to Data) Mister Data, take Ishara to see Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY / The ship's computer does. (re: Ishara's arm) There's always some differentiation in the somatic chromosomes -- but it's not enough to affect the results.
 BEVERLY / (to Data) It'll take me a few hours to run the isomorphic comparison.
 DATA / Tasha exists in our memories as well.
 DATA / Lieutenant Yar was killed on Vagra Two by a malevolent entity.
 DATA / No... she was killed as a demonstration of the creature's power. Without provocation.
 RIKER / The Captain approves. You're with us.
 RIKER / (touches insignia, quietly) Enterprise, we're in position.
 GEORDI / Damn!
 RIKER (O.S.) / Geordi -- what's taking so long?
 GEORDI / There's a lot of damage here... The myographic scanner is operational, but the power source is fluctuating.
 RIKER / Can you fix it?
 GEORDI / I can try to run a shunt from the convertor.
 RIKER / How long will that take?
 GEORDI / (shrugs) Ten minutes?
 RIKER / Do it.
 RIKER / (touches insignia) O'Brien! Lock onto Ishara and get her out of here!
 RIKER / (touches insignia) Standby! (to others) Stay here and cover La Forge.
 WORF / (concerned) Commander --
 RIKER / That's an order. Return to the ship when you're finished here. I'll signal for transport as soon as I can.
 RIKER / Energize!
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / (continuing) How is she?
 RIKER / A couple of cracked ribs, but she'll be all right.
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher just called me with the results of her DNA comparison. Ishara is Tasha's sister.
 RIKER / After what she did for us down there, I wouldn't doubt that for a minute.
 PICARD / (a beat) You took some unnecessary personal risks, Number One.
 RIKER / We lost Tasha on an away mission, under my command. The thought of the same thing happening to her sister...
 PICARD / That's an emotional response, Will. We can't afford that.
 RIKER / Understood, Captain.
 PICARD / Commander...
 PICARD / Well done.
 BEVERLY / I've fused the bone tissue along both fractures.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) The muscles around the area will be weak for a day or so -- but you shouldn't feel any pain.
 PICARD / I wanted to thank you personally for what you did for us down at the colony. It was... more than I expected.
 PICARD / Let me tell you about your sister. The first time I met Tasha Yar, she was making her way through a Carnelian mine field to reach a wounded colonist.
 PICARD / (continuing) Her ship had responded to their distress call, as had mine. When it was all over, I requested that Tasha be assigned to the Enterprise. (smiling) Her ship's captain owed me a favor.
 PICARD / (continuing) In the months that followed, Tasha never once failed to put the safety of the crew before her own. (beat) She died doing the same.
 PICARD / I'm sorry you never knew the woman Tasha became. I think you might have been proud of her. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) And she of you.
 DATA / What is this structure?
 DATA / The Tactical Station -- where Lieutenant Worf is now.
 DATA / Yes. She was especially close to Commander Riker and Lieutenant Worf. And to myself.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / Not as such. However, perhaps even among humans, friendship is sometimes less an emotional response, and more a sense of familiarity.
 DATA / Exactly. As I experience certain sensory input patterns, my mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs eventually are anticipated. And even "missed" when absent. When something once expected is no longer there.
 DATA / Yes. Like your sister.
 GEORDI / They've been moved so far underground that it took awhile to pinpoint their signatures.
 GEORDI / (continuing) The men are here. Next to one of the Alliance headquarters.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / (continuing) And that's about two kilometers of solid granite above them.
 RIKER / So much for the transporter.
 GEORDI / Not necessarily. We could use the ship's phasers to cut a shaft through the bedrock to this storage tunnel here.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / With a clear path through the rock, we'd be able to transport down to the tunnel. That would put us close enough to get to the crewmen.
 GEORDI / (continuing) It would take me a few hours to adjust the phasers for drilling.
 RIKER / It's a maze around there...
 WORF / We don't have much choice.
 DATA / We could remove the implant.
 DATA / A small force field containing xenon or another inert gas could be placed over the incision site. The explosive could thereby be safely disarmed at the same time it is removed.
 RIKER / It's more than just a tactical device to you, isn't it? It's part of your identity.
 RIKER / (continuing) This is something you'll have to decide for yourself, Ishara. Think about it while we're waiting for Geordi.
 DATA / And Tasha did not?
 DATA / You find that appealing?
 DATA / Thank you. I would like to consider you my friend, Ishara.
 DATA / Ishara is willing to have the implant removed.
 PICARD / Very good. You may inform Doctor Crusher.
 DATA / She also expressed a desire to leave the colony. She hopes to apply to the Academy and eventually join Starfleet.
 PICARD / Does she understand the magnitude of these decisions?
 DATA / She claims to, Captain.
 PICARD / Her courage certainly speaks in her favor. But Ishara's personal history concerns me.
 DATA / Did her sister not come from the very same environment, Sir?
 PICARD / Tasha never joined one of these gangs. Doesn't that suggest a fundamental difference between the two of them?
 DATA / I do not know. But I do know that often for humans, decisions made in youth only hold true for youth.
 TROI / I get a sense of ambiguity from her. Her loyalties are clearly divided, Captain, no matter what she may say.
 PICARD / Are you suggesting we deny her an escape from this environment, Counselor?
 TROI / No... I'm just not convinced she really wants to escape. It is the only way of life she's ever known.
 PICARD / Ultimately, it is her decision to make, not ours... (beat) Certainly nothing would please me more than to see another officer named Yar in the service of Starfleet... Mister Data, proceed with the rescue as discussed...
 TROI / Data?
 DATA / (turning back) Yes, Counselor?
 TROI / You seem so strong in your support. I'm curious...
 DATA / We must free the crewmen. She appears to be our best hope of doing so. Also, individuals worthy of Starfleet training are somewhat rare.
 DATA / (continuing) In addition...
 DATA / (continuing) I have become used to her.
 DATA / You are welcome. Doctor Crusher is expecting you in Sickbay.
 DATA / To what are you referring?
 DATA / But I do have something to gain. Your continued presence on this ship.
 DATA / (continuing) Is something wrong?
 DATA / If you desire privacy, you may use the observation lounge.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44225.3. Doctor Crusher has removed Ishara's magnetic implant, enabling the young woman to guide our rescue attempt.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Without my intending it, she has virtually become an active member of the crew.
 BEVERLY / Cardiovascular functions normal. Metabolism, immunity, all other vital signs excellent. (to Ishara) How do you feel?
 BEVERLY / You might want this... It was a part of your life for a long time.
 DATA / Have you reconsidered your decision to stay with us?
 WORF / I understand you wish to join Starfleet.
 WORF / On that day, it is we who will be "lucky."
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready?
 RIKER / (to com) Waiting for your signal, Captain.
 PICARD / Status, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Phasers in alignment and ready to fire.
 PICARD / How far must we penetrate to safely allow transporter function?
 GEORDI / One point six kilometers.
 PICARD / Fire phasers.
 GEORDI / Aye, Sir.
 GEORDI / One point three kilometers. One point four. One point five. One point six. (to Picard) Deep enough for transport, Sir.
 PICARD / Cease fire.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to O'Brien, Energize.
 WORF / Caution is indicated.
 RIKER / Ishara?
 WORF / Are you certain?
 RIKER / Hold out your hands.
 RIKER / Let's get moving.
 RIKER / Where is she?
 WORF / Commander, look.
 RIKER / What the hell happened here?
 WORF / She probably tried to draw their fire. It triggered the alarm.
 RIKER / (nodding) Worf, get these men back to the Enterprise. (to Data) Data, you're with me. She can't be far.
 DATA (O.S.) / Ishara.
 DATA / (continuing) What are you doing?
 DATA / (continuing) The fusion generator is overloading. (turns to her) You are attempting to disable the defense system. For what reason? We have rescued the crewmen.
 DATA / The Federation will be responsible for the resulting deaths. I cannot allow that.
 DATA / That is not true.
 DATA / (re: the generator) We will both be destroyed in the explosion.
 DATA / Was this your intention from the beginning?
 DATA / Our help was not deliberate. You deceived us.
 DATA / Your friendship with me was part of the deception, was it not?
 DATA / (continuing) You misled me at each step. And yet I was completely unaware.
 DATA / (re: the generator) My duty requires me to intercede.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Ishara!
 RIKER / What was she doing?
 DATA / Disabling the detection system so her forces could attack.
 RIKER / Set to kill.
 WORF / The Captain wants to see you on the bridge.
 WORF / That is Captain Picard's decision. (beat) If the captain were Klingon, you would be executed.
 WORF / Such a warrior must also be prepared to suffer the consequences.
 PICARD / Your strategy failed.
 RIKER / (angered) You're not in a position to dictate to anybody. She attacked two Federation officers.
 RIKER / Don't talk about legal rights. Your jurisdiction is based entirely on the threat of violence.
 PICARD / Commander Data, escort Ishara to the transporter toom.
 PICARD / Close the channel.
 RIKER / You're far more charitable than I would have been, Captain.
 PICARD / I understand your feelings, Number One. I share them. But perhaps the fault lies in ourselves. We were so eager to embrace her. Each of us, myself included, wanted to see something of Tasha in her sister. We saw more than what was there.
 DATA / What do you wish to talk about?
 DATA / (reminding her) I am an android. It is not possible for me to be injured in that fashion.
 DATA / Energize.
 RIKER / Come in.
 RIKER / (continuing) Data. Come in, come in.
 DATA / Commander.
 RIKER / What's on your mind?
 DATA / Recent events have left me puzzled, Sir. (off Riker's look) It has been days since Ishara left. And yet, my thoughts seem to dwell on her. Almost as if I were experiencing a feedback loop in my mnemonic network.
 RIKER / I know what you mean.
 DATA / It is curious that I was so easily misled.
 RIKER / Make that "we."
 DATA / Yes sir.
 RIKER / Data, in every trust is the possibility of betrayal. I don't think you were prepared for that.
 DATA / Were you prepared?
 RIKER / I'm not sure anybody ever is.
 DATA / Then is it better not to trust?
 RIKER / (continuing) Without trust, there can be no friendship, no closeness. None of the emotional bonds that make us what we are.
 DATA / And yet you put yourself at risk.
 RIKER / Every single time. Love itself is a leap of faith.
 DATA / So, a prerequisite for love is accepting the risk of betrayal.
 RIKER / That's an interesting point of view, Data. Maybe you're right.
 RIKER / (continuing) The emotions we experience when someone we believe in turns away -- they're the most painful a person can feel. (a beat) We believed in her, Data...
 DATA / Yes. Perhaps I am fortunate to be spared the emotional consequences.
 RIKER / (gently) Perhaps...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 44246.3 We are investigating radiation anomalies reported in the Gamma Arigulon system by the starship LaSalle. Preliminary readings are inconclusive.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WESLEY, and WORF at their / stations.
 RIKER / Mister Data?
 DATA / No change, Commander. I can detect no abnormalities in the star's radiant energy.
 PICARD / Prepare two class one probes.
 DATA / Probes ready, sir.
 PICARD / Initiate launch sequence.
 WORF / (reads console) Captain... Klingon attack cruiser decloaking, bearing zero-one-zero mark three-two-seven.
 PICARD / Belay that order, Mister Data.
 RIKER / Did Starfleet mention any Klingon ships in this sector?
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / We are being hailed.
 RIKER / All stop, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY / Aye, sir. All stop.
 PICARD / Open channel.
 PICARD / (surprised) Ambassador K'Ehleyr... This is an unexpected pleasure.
 PICARD / How may we be of assistance, Ambassador?
 PICARD / Granted.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, please receive our guest.
 WORF / Captain... I must request permission to... send another officer.
 PICARD / May I ask your reason?
 WORF / My... dishonor among Klingons... may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr.
 PICARD / (firm) You are a member of this crew, Lieutenant... and I will not have you go into hiding whenever a Klingon ship uncloaks.
 WORF / I withdraw the request, sir.
 WORF / Two?
 WORF / Energize.
 WORF / Bridge.
 WORF / Perhaps you are not aware of my dishonor. I have accepted... discommendation.
 WORF / You may not respect our traditions... I do!
 WORF / Must I ask the question?
 RIKER / War over what?
 DATA / The word "excuses" implies that there are ulterior motives for a conflict.
 PICARD / Do you believe there is a threat to the Federation in this... struggle?
 TROI / Now something has changed that.
 PICARD / I heard you were ill.
 PICARD / If the Enterprise medical facility...
 PICARD / What do you want of me?
 PICARD / I will?
 PICARD / K'mpec. You can't be serious. A Federation officer has no business...
 PICARD / On the contrary, I think it is very different. And I must respectfully decline.
 PICARD / (angry) You had no right to involve me without my permission.
 PICARD / This is not a case of simple mediation... you are asking me to choose the next leader of the Klingon Empire.
 PICARD / But you've just said there are only two challengers arriving. What is the point?
 PICARD / (dry) Interesting? Yes, I would say that, since he conspired to strip Worf of his good name and tried to have me killed...
 PICARD / Very well. I accept.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log: supplemental. K'mpec, who ruled the Klingon Empire longer than anyone in history, is dead. We await the arrival of Duras and Gowron... rivals for the leadership of the High Council.
 WORF / There is no honor in attacking the weak.
 WORF / You must earn victory...
 WORF / There are no others on board.
 WORF / The Federation and the Klingon Empire were enemies for many years. No other Klingons have asked to serve in Starfleet.
 WORF / (firm) A warrior does not ask so many questions.
 WORF / (angry) He knows nothing of our ways!
 WORF / He is Klingon!
 WORF / Why did you not tell me?
 WORF / You should not have kept this from me.
 WORF / I cannot... acknowledge my relationship to the boy.
 WORF / (continuing) It would only harm him.
 WORF / As my son, he would also bear my disgrace... as would his children.
 WORF / (quiet) My father was accused of collaborating with the Romulans at Khitomer...
 WORF / Yes... at first. Ultimately... I withdrew my challenge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge.
 WORF / (hits communicator) On our way, Commander.
 WESLEY / Klingon vessels Vorn and Buruk holding stations at thirteen kilometers.
 PICARD / Open a channel, Mister Data.
 DATA / (works console) Channel open. Vorn responding to hail.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / In good time, Duras.
 PICARD / (coolly) The Sonchi ceremony will take place in one hour aboard K'mpec's ship.
 PICARD / There is no delay. It is the time I have chosen.
 PICARD / (will not be pushed) Picard... out.
 PICARD / (to Data) Contact Gowron's ship, tell him to meet us aboard K'mpec's vessel. Ambassador, I'll meet you in Transporter Room Six in an hour. We'll begin the ceremony a little late. (moves to Ready Room) Mister Worf.
 PICARD / Worf, I know the next couple of days will be difficult for you...
 WORF / You have made it clear that I am to perform my regular duties, sir.
 PICARD / (beat) I want you to know I am aware of your... discomfort.
 WORF / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / Ambassador K'ehleyr will be preparing me for my role in the rite of succession. But I have no doubt that I will be calling upon you for assistance as well, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Permission to speak freely, sir?
 PICARD / Granted.
 WORF / Duras must not be allowed to lead the council.
 PICARD / He has a legal claim, Worf. Your personal feelings toward him...
 WORF / It is not personal, sir. His father betrayed my people to the Romulans. Duras is a traitor.
 PICARD / Klingon tradition may blame the son for the father's sins. I cannot, Worf. Treason was his father's disgrace. Duras' crime was to put that blame on your father... I will not forget that. But you should not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of that lie.
 WORF / (acknowledges) To preserve the Empire.
 PICARD / The issue now is whether or not he killed K'mpec.
 WORF / Sir?
 PICARD / He was murdered... poisoned.
 WORF / (shocked) A Klingon would not use poison... the murder would have no honor.
 PICARD / K'mpec believed the assassin to be either Duras or Gowron.
 WORF / (reacts) I know little of Gowron. Only that he is an outsider who has often challenged the council. But Duras... I know him... his heart is not Klingon.
 PICARD / (with distaste) I hope this is brief.
 PICARD / Qab... jIH... nagil (Face me if you dare!)
 PICARD / We will proceed according to the traditions and precedents set down in Klingon law.
 PICARD / We will reconvene on the Enterprise within---
 WORF / I... have not received your report on the explosion.
 WORF / As head of security... it is my duty to be concerned.
 WORF / (difficult) You know my... feelings.
 WORF / You were right... I would have insisted that we take the oath. But not just because of tradition...
 WORF / jIH dok (My blood)
 WORF / I cannot allow you to... suffer my humiliation.
 WORF / But what of the boy? He may want to live in the Empire someday. He would be an outcast... another traitor from a family of traitors.
 WORF / (quiet) Respect my wishes in this matter. I cannot take the oath with you... (very difficult) And I cannot claim your son.
 PICARD / (frustrated) We haven't completed our analysis of the bomb debris... and Doctor Crusher is still studying the remains of the two men killed in the explosion. (beat) We need more time.
 PICARD / Is there some way of stretching out the formalities once they arrive?
 PICARD / You said "modern Rite"... how was the ritual performed in the past?
 PICARD / Can the old form still be used?
 PICARD / I'm sorry... but I cannot discuss it.
 PICARD / mev yap! (Stop!)
 PICARD / (firm) Sit down.
 PICARD / (continuing) We will begin the ja'chuq.
 PICARD / I choose to respect the ancient ritual. Each of you must prove your worthiness to lead the High Council.
 WORF / Kathless... the Unforgettable... he united the Homeworld in the year...
 WORF / A tricorder... (takes device) It is operated by activating the...
 WORF / It is a bat'telh.
 WORF / (continuing) It belonged to my father... it has been in our family for ten generations.
 WORF / No. (takes the weapon) Do not think of it as a weapon... make it part of your hand... your arm... make it part of you.
 GEORDI and Data at the pool table. They are working on / one of the consoles. Riker ENTERS and goes over to them.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) We've completed our analysis of the bomb debris.
 DATA / The explosive was a triceron derivative.
 GEORDI / The entire device couldn't have been more than three cubic millimeters in size...
 RIKER / Then it could have been hidden anywhere in the room.
 GEORDI / (acknowledges) There's one other thing, Commander... The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator.
 DATA / Only one race uses that device, sir...
 RIKER / (nods) The Romulans.
 PICARD / How could Romulans have planted a bomb aboard a Klingon attack cruiser?
 WORF / It would be impossible.
 GEORDI / (with disbelief) Klingons and Romulans working together? They've been blood enemies for seventy-five years.
 PICARD / Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes to improve that relationship.
 RIKER / A new Klingon alliance with the Romulans?
 DATA / If true, it would represent a fundamental shift of power in the quadrant.
 PICARD / Indeed. (beat) It would put the Federation in a very uncomfortable position.
 RIKER / (a beat) Gowron or Duras?
 PICARD / (reacts) But does that suggest a Romulan connection?
 WORF / Captain... I disagree. It must be Duras.
 PICARD / We have had prior dealings with Duras that showed him to be... untrustworthy.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, we now have a conspiracy on our hands that could be a direct threat to the security of the Federation.
 WORF / Yes sir.
 PICARD / As Chief Security Officer, you will accompany me to the next transition proceeding.
 WORF / (reacts) Captain, they will be incensed. My presence will be... disruptive.
 PICARD / (nods, a beat) Yes. It will.
 WORF / Deck Twenty-Three.
 WORF / I cannot---
 WORF / I will not discuss this with you or anyone else.
 WORF / I am aware of what is at stake here!
 WORF / I am hiding nothing!
 PICARD / Both your claims have been properly made and recorded. We are ready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess while I review your petitions.
 PICARD / (beat) I know that you're as concerned as I am about the explosion aboard K'mpec's ship. I assume both of your investigations are continuing...
 PICARD / That's very interesting... because our analysis turned up some startling results. (keying insignia) Will you join us?
 PICARD / (final) It is my prerogative to investigate anything relevant to the Rite of Succession. Lieutenant Worf is my chief of security. His presence is required.
 PICARD / I will determine how we proceed. If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq... that is your option.
 WORF / What did your investigations reveal about the explosion?
 WORF / (to Gowron) Was your analysis just as... insightful?
 WORF / (impatient) What type?
 WORF / What about the detonator?
 WORF / Fortunately, our investigation was more... thorough.
 WORF / (continuing) The bomb used a molecular-decay detonator.
 PICARD / (nods) A Romulan device.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, please be sure to send a complete record of our findings to both vessels... and to the High Council. (beat) We are adjourned.
 BEVERLY / One of the Klingons who died in the explosion was with Duras... the other with Gowron. I've been examining the bodies... trying to get a clue to where the bomb was hidden.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) There's always a pattern to the lacerations and tissue damage. It would normally give us a clear indication of direction, distance, force of impact...
 RIKER / 'Normally'?
 BEVERLY / In this case, the pattern was virtually impossible to identify... I couldn't understand it until I checked the dynascans...
 BEVERLY / This wound is different from all the others... it was made from the inside out. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / (he reacts) The bomb was implanted in one of their forearms.
 RIKER / It is considered an honorable way for a Klingon to die, Doctor... a suicide that also takes an enemy. (beat) Which one of them was it?
 BEVERLY / Duras' man.
 WORF / When we have more time I will take you to the holodeck and demonstrate in more detail...
 WORF / (hits communicator) Medical Emergency, Deck Eight, Room one-four-two!
 WORF / Gowron... ?
 WORF / Duras?
 WORF / You have never seen death?
 WORF / Then look...
 WORF / And always remember.
 WORF / Stay with the doctor.
 BEVERLY / Worf, when did you... ?
 BEVERLY / Multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen... too much trauma to the internal organs. There wasn't enough time to get her into stasis.
 PICARD / Where's Worf?
 BEVERLY / I don't know... he left just after I got here.
 RIKER / (hits communicator) Riker to Worf. (beat) Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf.
 PICARD / Where is he?
 RIKER / On my way.
 WORF / K'Ehleyr... was my mate.
 DATA / And if Lieutenant Worf resists, sir?
 RIKER / He's coming back with us one way or another. Set phasers to maximum stun.
 WORF / (without hesitation) Then that is how it shall be.
 RIKER / Worf!
 PICARD / Lieutenant, you are a fine officer... your service aboard this ship has been exemplary... (beat) Until now.
 WORF / Sir, I acted within the boundaries of Klingon law and tradition.
 PICARD / The High Council seems to agree with you. They consider the matter to be closed. (beat) I do not.
 PICARD / The Enterprise crew currently includes representatives from thirteen planets, Mister Worf. They each have their individual beliefs and values and I respect them all. But every member of the crew has chosen to serve Starfleet. If anyone cannot perform his duties because of the demands of his society, he must resign.
 PICARD / Do you wish to resign, Lieutenant?
 WORF / (swallows hard) Captain...
 PICARD / I would hope you would not throw away a promising career.
 WORF / No sir.
 PICARD / (softer) I understand your pain... we all felt very close to K'Ehleyr. (long beat) A reprimand will be on your record. Dismissed.
 PICARD / Worf...
 PICARD / Isn't it time for the truth about your father's innocence to be told? After all, the reasons you accepted this dishonor were to protect the name of Duras, and hold the Empire together. Now that he's died in disgrace... where is the honor in further silence?
 WORF / Each member of the Klingon high council shared in that lie. They will not be so willing to admit their own dishonor. (beat) But the day will come when my brother and I will... "convince" them to speak the truth.
 WORF / My parents... my human parents will meet us at Starbase Seventy-Three. They will care for you.
 WORF / You deserve a home... a family. My parents can provide that... I cannot.
 WORF / (gently) I miss her too.
 WORF / Yes... I am your father.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44286.5. The Enterprise is conducting a security survey of the Onias Sector near the Neutral Zone. Despite being close to Romulan territory, our mission has been quiet and uneventful.
 Begin close on the mouth of a trombone... then reveal RIKER playing the horn to an appreciative audience made / up of GEORDI, TROI and several CREWMEMBERS. Riker finishes his recital with a flourish... and a flat note. As Riker grins good-naturedly, everyone laughs and applauds.
 GEORDI / Alright, Commander... you've got until your next birthday to get that right.
 TROI / Many things improve with age... maybe your trombone playing will be one of them.
 BEVERLY / It's candle time, birthday boy.
 TROI / What did you wish for, Will?
 RIKER / Music lessons.
 DATA is at Ops and various SUPERNUMERARIES are at the / other positions as PICARD steps out of the Ready Room.
 PICARD / Mister Data, we'd better hurry or we'll miss Commander Riker's party.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / I find it interesting how humans place so much importance on celebrating the day of their birth... a day one cannot possibly remember...
 PICARD / We had better take a look, Mister Data.
 DATA / It appears we are being probed.
 PICARD / Source?
 DATA / The third planet of the Alpha Onias system. Our reports list it as presently uninhabited. Perhaps the reports were incorrect.
 PICARD / Or perhaps the rumors of a secret Romulan base in this sector are true.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Commander Riker.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (continuing) I apologize for interrupting your celebration, but I need an Away Team.
 DATA / Although Alpha Onias Three is a Class M planet, our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable.
 RIKER / Any life signs?
 DATA / No, sir... but we have traced some residual energy readings... to a cavern two kilometers beneath the surface.
 WORF / Romulans?
 DATA / It is possible. But I cannot be certain.
 PICARD / I suppose you'll just have to go down there and find out.
 RIKER / Worf, Geordi... you're with me.
 PICARD / (half apologetic) Number One... Happy Birthday.
 GEORDI / I'm detecting high levels of volcanic gases... sulphur dioxide, methane, hydrogen sulphide...
 RIKER / Toxic?
 GEORDI / We're okay for now... But I wouldn't want to spend my vacation here.
 RIKER / What about energy readings?
 WORF / Magnetic clutter is increasing. I cannot make an accurate determination.
 GEORDI / Same here. I'm getting some very confused readings...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (breaking up, through static) Bridge to Riker. Report. Please acknowledge.
 RIKER / (keys insignia) This is Riker.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (breaking up, through static) We're having trouble reading you.
 PICARD / And we are having similar difficulties reading you, Number One. I am advising you...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / ... and your team to transport up... At once...
 GEORDI / Good advice, Commander. We've got a sudden build-up of gases here... especially methane.
 RIKER / Transporter Room, take us up.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF HUBBLE struggles with the / Transporter Scan.
 PICARD / Transporter Room... What's happening? Report!
 RIKER / Beverly?
 BEVERLY / (pleased smile) You remember me... that's good. What else can you remember, Captain?
 RIKER / (confused) Captain?
 BEVERLY / (to food slot) Water. Three Celsius.
 BEVERLY / How do you feel?
 RIKER / Confused.
 BEVERLY / (small smile) Understandable... considering what's happened.
 RIKER / What has happened... to this Sickbay... to you... to me?
 BEVERLY / Sit down, Captain.
 RIKER / I am not "Captain." I'm Commander... Commander Will Riker. What's going on here?
 BEVERLY / Sit... Please.
 BEVERLY / What is the last thing you remember clearly?
 RIKER / Alpha Onias Three. The Enterprise had been probed... Geordi, Worf, and I transported down to track the source.
 BEVERLY / But all you found was toxic gas. They barely got the three of you out in time. (a careful beat) Will... that happened sixteen years ago.
 RIKER / That's not possible!
 BEVERLY / With an Altarian virus, anything is possible. In fact, we expected this.
 RIKER / Could you be more specific?
 BEVERLY / That day on Onias Three you were infected with a strain of Altarian encephalitis. A retrovirus that incorporates its DNA directly into the cells of its host. It can lie dormant for years, then suddenly become active, as it did in your case ten days ago. (a beat) You've been in a coma, delirious... Your fever finally broke this morning...
 RIKER / But what happened to my memory?
 BEVERLY / This is a scan of your brain tissue. When the encephalitis became active... it caused widespread synapse degradation, interrupting the consolidation of memory...
 RIKER / (get to the point) Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Will... this virus invariably destroys all memory back to the moment of the original infection. In your case, all the way back to Alpha Onias Three.
 RIKER / I can't believe this... it's a dream... or...
 BEVERLY / Feel my hand... flesh and bone. This is not a dream... and you are Captain William T. Riker... in command of the Enterprise.
 RIKER / (almost afraid to ask) The Enterprise... for how long?
 BEVERLY / Nine years.
 RIKER / If I've lost my memory... how do I find it again?
 BEVERLY / Memory is formed out of association. Smells, sounds, and images in the present could possibly trigger them.
 RIKER / (seeing it) Like the way a song can remind you of... old friends...
 BEVERLY / Exactly. In associational therapy, we expose the patient to familiar surroundings. This could stimulate the brain's neural synapses into regenerating.
 RIKER / Then let's get started. There's nothing more familiar to me than the Enterprise. If anything's going to bring back...
 BEVERLY / Will... I said your memory could return. In many of these cases... the damage is permanent.
 RIKER / What about Geordi and Worf? Were they infected, too?
 BEVERLY / Thankfully, no. Geordi appears to have been immune and the virus has no effect on Klingons.
 RIKER / Speaking of Klingons...
 BEVERLY / There have been a lot of changes on the Enterprise in the last sixteen years.
 BEVERLY / Which is why we should begin the associational therapy in your quarters. Personal recollections are always the most vivid. (to Computer) Deck Eight.
 RIKER / Belay that.
 RIKER / My life is on the Bridge, always has been. If anything's going to jog my memory... (to computer) Main Bridge.
 RIKER / I said, Main Bridge.
 BEVERLY / The computer has been slow all morning. A processing accelerator is down. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / Commander La Forge is running a Level-1 diagnostic to isolate the problem.
 Riker steps out from the aft Turbolift, followed by Beverly. The first crewman they encounter is an older GEORDI standing at the aft engineering station... his / back to them. Riker is delighted...
 RIKER / Geordi...
 GEORDI / Good to see you up and about again, sir.
 RIKER / Geordi... your eyes... what happened to your VISOR... ?
 GEORDI / My VISOR? I... (catches self) Sorry, sir. Doctor Crusher warned us... you might not remember. (starts again) I don't need my VISOR, Captain... not since I got these cloned implants...
 WORF / (acknowledging Riker) Captain.
 DATA / Welcome back, Captain. We did not expect to see you on the Bridge so soon.
 RIKER / Commander Data... You are my First Officer?
 DATA / You remember, sir?
 RIKER / (after a pause) No, Data. Not a single day of the last sixteen years.
 WORF / Warbird Uncloaking.
 DATA / On screen.
 RIKER / Shields up. Go to Red Alert.
 DATA / Captain... we have been expecting the Decius. There is no need for alarm.
 RIKER / Cancel Red Alert. (to Data) Clearly, I need to be... briefed.
 WORF / The Decius is hailing us, Captain. The Admiral wishes to speak to you.
 RIKER / On screen.
 PICARD / Will!
 RIKER / (what's one more surprise?) Admiral... Picard. Deanna.
 TROI / How are you feeling?
 RIKER / I've felt better.
 PICARD / Not surprising. Altarian Viruses can be a nasty business.
 RIKER / That's... an understatement... I can't even...
 PICARD / (interrupting) We can discuss this... after we transport over. Picard out.
 RIKER / Transporter Room Six.
 BEVERLY / How are you holding up?
 RIKER / (after a deep breath) I could get used to the idea of a Ferengi Ensign... but Admiral Picard... on a Romulan Warbird? What is that all about?
 BEVERLY / I think I should leave the explanations to the Admiral.
 RIKER / Whenever you're ready, Chief.
 PICARD / Captain Riker... it's good to see you have recovered.
 RIKER / (quietly) I'm not exactly sure you can call it a recovery, sir.
 TROI / Then there was... a memory loss.
 PICARD / How much?
 BEVERLY / (after a beat) Everything... since Alpha Onias Three.
 PICARD / To lose sixteen years...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... that is almost beyond belief.
 RIKER / (quiet) I'm having trouble believing it myself, Admiral.
 TROI / (to Riker) It must be overwhelming to have so much of your life... missing...
 PICARD / And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. A few more days of relatively simple negotiations, and the treaty will be signed.
 RIKER / What negotiations? What treaty?
 PICARD / Sorry. I'll start at the beginning, which was four years ago. A Romulan battle cruiser strayed into Federation space. Its warp coils had collapsed, and its life support was failing.
 TROI / You saved them, Will. You and the Enterprise.
 PICARD / This impressed the Romulans, to say the least. After years of distrust and conflict, they started to talk. You have been our key spokesman...
 PICARD / ... in securing an alliance with the Romulans.
 RIKER / How far have these negotiations progressed?
 PICARD / The preliminaries are over. All we need do now is escort the Romulan Ambassador to the final session.
 TROI / Where you will help complete the negotiations and sign the treaty.
 RIKER / Captain, excuse me, sir, I mean Admiral... I am in no condition to negotiate with the Romulans or anyone else.
 PICARD / Will... you are of sound mind and body. If you were properly briefed, you could still fulfill your duties.
 RIKER / With a sixteen year gap in my head?
 PICARD / I know this has all been... a terrible shock... but we do need you.
 RIKER / (with difficulty) Sir, I'm not sure I'm... fit to resume command...
 PICARD / (gently) I appreciate your candor and your concern. But despite your... affliction... there is still no one better equipped to deal with these Romulans than you.
 RIKER / When do we leave?
 PICARD / (relieved) As soon as the Ambassador transports over from the Decius. I'll make the arrangements. (intently) We will get through this. As we have many times before.
 RIKER / I hope so.
 TROI / Let me take you to your quarters.
 RIKER / Good idea... I've had enough surprises for one day.
 RIKER / (what else can he say?) I'm... sorry.
 TROI / I need to talk to your father, Jean-Luc. Could you leave us alone... for just a moment?
 RIKER / Why didn't you warn me?
 TROI / Beverly hoped that meeting Jean-Luc like this might have an impact... help you remember.
 RIKER / It had an impact alright... (shakes his head)
 TROI / Give it time.
 RIKER / (reflective) Jean-Luc.
 TROI / (droll) The Admiral was very pleased when you chose that name. He is a wonderful boy.
 RIKER / (the next big question) Deanna... where's his mother?
 TROI / She died two years ago... a shuttle accident. I'm sorry, Will.
 RIKER / I have absolutely no recollection of her... what was she like?
 TROI / 'Min' was very beautiful, of course. And strong, intelligent, patient...
 RIKER / She had to be patient, if she was married to me.
 TROI / She was an excellent Captain's wife, and a very good ship's counselor. (to Riker's look) She took over after I left.
 RIKER / I can't imagine you leaving the Enterprise.
 TROI / Admiral Picard offered me a position at Starfleet Command. It was a tremendous opportunity... I couldn't refuse.
 TROI / Will... What's important is that today, right now, you have a son who needs you. Spend time with him... you may find part of what you've lost.
 RIKER / I've heard better.
 RIKER / You're putting too much pressure on the mouthpiece. Relax. Just use the muscles you need.
 RIKER / Okay. Left hand like this. Right hand... like this.
 RIKER / After sixteen years... you'd think I could get that right...
 RIKER / Computer. Summarize service record. Riker, William T., Captain. Beginning with... the Fornax Disaster.
 RIKER / Service record. Riker, William T.
 RIKER / Damn it.
 RIKER / That computer time lag. I can't believe Geordi's still running his diagnostic...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Captain Riker. The Romulan Ambassador is ready to transport over from the Decius.
 RIKER / On my way. (to the boy) I've got to go, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / (gently) Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc. How is my namesake holding up to all this?
 RIKER / Better than I am.
 TROI / We did our best to prepare him.
 RIKER / (sighs) I'm trying to catch up with all this. I've still got a long way to go. A long way.
 PICARD / Just follow my lead with the Ambassador. You'll do fine.
 RIKER / Beam him aboard, chief.
 PICARD / Ambassador Tomalak... Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
 RIKER / (what is this?) Ambassador... Tomalak? At Nelvana Three, he threatened to take the hull of the Enterprise home as a war trophy!
 TROI / That was a long time ago. Many things have changed. Including Tomalak.
 PICARD / I agree, Ambassador. All of the difficult issues have been resolved.
 PICARD / But we have come to an agreement both sides can live with. Thanks largely to Captain Riker.
 RIKER / As I hope it will benefit mine.
 RIKER / Main Bridge.
 PICARD / (smoothly) I assure you Captain Riker is quite well. He's looking forward to attending the final negotiations... as planned.
 RIKER / Thank you... Ambassador.
 RIKER / Admiral, Deanna... I need a moment with you... (to Data) ... Commander Data, if you will, please accompany the Ambassador on his... tour.
 DATA / Certainly, sir.
 RIKER / (to Tomalak) Excuse us, Ambassador.
 DATA / You may find this of interest, Ambassador... (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (points at tactical board) ... These newly refined sensors are capable of pinpointing the power emissions of...
 RIKER / Are you telling me you trust Tomalak?
 PICARD / I trust the process we have built with the Romulans over the past four years. They have nothing to gain by betrayal.
 RIKER / Are you sure? You yourself have said it's always like a chess game with the Romulans. Move and counter-move, guile and deceit --
 TROI / (gently cutting in) I sense no such dishonesty in Tomalak. He is sincere in his desire for peace. He wants this alliance. There is no cause for concern.
 RIKER / No cause for concern? We're talking about revealing the location of Outpost Twenty-Three, the key to all our Neutral Zone defenses.
 PICARD / Pardon my bluntness, Captain, but your information is out of date. The strategic importance of Outpost Twenty-Three is minimal. And has been for years.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Doctor Crusher to Riker. Are you there, Captain?
 RIKER / (keys insignia) What is it, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Your son has been injured. He's been taken to Sickbay. You better come down here right away.
 RIKER / Are you alright?
 RIKER / (to Beverly) What happened?
 BEVERLY / It's broken... But we'll have it all taken care of in a minute.
 BEVERLY / Now just take it easy on that arm for a while.
 RIKER / (to Jean-Luc) How did you do this?
 RIKER / (appalled) Parrises Squares... at your age... ? You could have broken your neck!
 BEVERLY / Continue the compression attenuator for two more minutes.
 BEVERLY / (to Riker) Can I talk to you for a moment?
 RIKER / (to Jean-Luc) I'll be right back.
 BEVERLY / Will... how old were you when you started playing Parrises Squares?
 RIKER / (thinks, sighs) Alright... I was probably younger than he is...
 RIKER / It's just that... For all practical purposes, this is my first day as a father... my son almost kills himself...
 BEVERLY / He didn't almost kill himself... he just broke a wrist... like a lot of other boys who fall down.
 RIKER / (acknowledges his over-reaction) You're right... But it's... difficult.
 BEVERLY / Difficult for you? What about Jean-Luc? Can you imagine how he must feel? (beat) You've lost sixteen years, but Jean-Luc has lost a lot more... his mother... and now his father.
 RIKER / Thanks.
 RIKER / How's the arm?
 RIKER / Nothing as important as this, son.
 RIKER / Halt.
 RIKER / I know this must be... very hard for you.
 RIKER / (takes a deep breath) Okay's not good enough.
 RIKER / When I was your age... my own father... he wasn't there for me. And I needed him. I really... needed him. (softly) I always wondered what kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. Maybe the idea even scared me a little.
 RIKER / Yeah. (beat, smiles) But I must have gotten over it, huh? You're here.
 RIKER / (to com) Resume.
 RIKER / It's just important to me... that I don't... let you down, Jean-Luc.
 RIKER / I'll have to take your word for that... because I don't remember any of it... Not your first tooth, your first step... nothing... And I want to remember.
 RIKER / Guess there's only one thing to do. We've got to make some new memories...
 RIKER / I don't know if it's still in the memory banks, but I used to have this great fishing program on the Holodeck...
 RIKER / You know it?
 RIKER / Want to go again?
 RIKER / Then as soon as the negotiations are out of the way, we're going fishing.
 RIKER / I'm almost glad I can't remember that!
 RIKER / (beat) What was she like... your Mom.
 RIKER / Computer. Display family record. Riker. William T. Limit to visuals.
 RIKER / Computer. Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T.
 RIKER / The computer's still not acting right. I'm having trouble finding a visual record of your mother.
 RIKER (OPTICAL) / 
 RIKER / (softly, to himself) 'Min... Minuet?'
 RIKER / (softly) Yes...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Riker.
 RIKER / (keying insignia) Riker here.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain... please come to the Bridge.
 RIKER / On my way.
 RIKER / What's the problem?
 GEORDI / I've had to shut down the warp engines, Captain.
 RIKER / Why?
 GEORDI / The antimatter containment fields were fluctuating. Nothing to worry about, though.
 RIKER / (oh, come on!) We're on the edge of the Neutral Zone on impulse power, and you're not concerned?
 GEORDI / I'll have the engines back on line in no time, sir.
 RIKER / (sarcastic) As fast as you tracked down that faulty processing accelerator?
 GEORDI / (defensive) I'm running a Level One diagnostic...
 RIKER / ... for thirty hours... ? It's never taken you more than four. You're not capable of that kind of incompetence, La Forge.
 GEORDI / But, sir...
 RIKER / Where did you get that scar?
 WORF / (proudly) In combat, sir.
 RIKER / What battle? When? Which unit, which sector?
 RIKER / If we left immediately, when would we arrive at Outpost Twenty Three?
 DATA / At Warp One, in three days, four hours...
 RIKER / How about at Warp Seven? (to Data's silence) At Warp Eight? At Warp Nine? What's wrong, Data? What happened to all those millions of calculations per second?
 DATA / Pardon me, sir... but I am receiving subspace interference which limits my abilities. I can't operate as quickly as...
 RIKER / What did you say, Commander?
 DATA / I said I cannot operate --
 RIKER / No. That's not what you said. You said "I can't." You used a contraction. Didn't you?
 DATA / Sir, I can explain --
 RIKER / -- No you can't. Don't even try.
 PICARD / Captain Riker, this is no way to act in front of Ambassador...
 RIKER / Shut up!
 PICARD / What did you say?
 RIKER / (hammering) Shut up, as in close your mouth, and stop talking.
 TROI / Will... I can sense how upset you are. You're angry, impatient --
 RIKER / Back off, Deanna.
 RIKER / Well... anyone else want to speak up. Or can we end this... charade?
 RIKER / (evenly) The Enterprise... my son... you created it all.
 RIKER / It wasn't. There was the computer time lag, for one thing.
 RIKER / To smash your house of cards? No, it was the visual record of my "wife," Minuet. Bad move.
 RIKER / Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet was nothing more than a computer generated fantasy I once experienced on another Holodeck.
 RIKER / She was part of a very special program.
 RIKER / If Outpost Twenty-three is what you're after... Why didn't you just use your neural scanners to probe my mind?
 RIKER / Gaps? After what I've just seen, I find that hard to believe. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / You recreated the Enterprise, the crew... every nuance, every sound, smell... perfectly accurate. I sure didn't notice any gaps... (beat) I don't buy it, Tomalak.
 RIKER / My colleagues... ?
 RIKER / My people won't stop looking for me, Tomalak.
 RIKER / (surprised) Jean-Luc?
 RIKER / What have you done to him?
 RIKER / (gently) What's your name?
 RIKER / Look... if we're going to get out of here, you've got to trust me...
 RIKER / Easy... I won't hurt you.
 RIKER / Who are you? How did you get here?
 RIKER / My name is Will.
 RIKER / (a gentle inquiry) Miridian Six... near the Neutral Zone? I thought it was uninhabited...
 RIKER / It's odd the Enterprise wasn't advised...
 RIKER / Where are your parents, now?
 RIKER / Do you know why the Romulans are keeping you here?
 RIKER / Ethan... I'll get us out of here...
 RIKER / You escaped?
 RIKER / Ethan... no!
 RIKER / This secret hiding place of yours... ?
 RIKER / Their sensors should have picked us up...
 RIKER / Heavy metals?
 RIKER / When you escaped last time... how'd you manage it?
 RIKER / (instantly intrigued) How many guards at the shuttle bay?
 RIKER / Stealing a shuttle would get us nowhere... too easy for the Romulans to track one of their own ships. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (points at map) But we could break into communications. Send a message to the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Do you know whose voice it accepts?
 RIKER / (reacts) Who?
 RIKER / Ambassador Tomalak.
 RIKER / Tomalak is a Romulan Captain. The only time he was called "Ambassador" was in their Holodeck fantasy. How would you know about that?
 RIKER / Who are you? What's your part in all this?
 RIKER / (calm) But you said their sensors didn't work in this tunnel.
 RIKER / And where will we go, Ethan?
 RIKER / No... I've had enough.
 RIKER / No more games. No more fantasies. I'm not going to play anymore.
 RIKER / It was never the Romulans... it was you all along, wasn't it?
 DATA / There is no question about it, sir. It is his signal.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Riker... can you read me?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (after a beat) Riker to Picard. I'm here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Are you all right?
 RIKER / Yes... What about Worf and Geordi?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We beamed them up an hour ago... They're fine.
 PICARD / But we lost you in mid-transport. Where have you been? What is going on down there?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I'm not sure, sir.
 RIKER / But I think I'm about to find out... stand by.
 RIKER / What should I call you? Ethan... Jean-Luc?
 RIKER / This room... it's more than just a Holodeck, isn't it?
 RIKER / What I wanted? You probed the Enterprise... lured us here... so you could play games with me. I didn't want any of that... you did. Why?
 RIKER / But they found her, didn't they?
 RIKER / Everything... then why kidnap me?
 RIKER / I have to return to my ship. (a beat) Come with me. You don't have to stay here anymore... you don't have to be alone anymore...
 RIKER / To me, you'll always be Jean-Luc.
 RIKER / Two to transport...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44307.3. I am preparing to leave by shuttlecraft for Pentarus Five, where I have been asked to mediate a dispute among the salenite miners -- a contentious group unfortunately prone to violence.
 PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA, WORF, and ENSIGN TESS / ALLENBY at their positions.
 PICARD (V.O.) / At the same time, I must deal with a situation of a far more personal nature.
 WESLEY comes bursting in through the Turbolift door, / out of breath and a little anxious. Everyone on the Bridge looks stern and a little disgruntled with him.
 PICARD / Ensign, I summoned you almost ten minutes ago!
 WESLEY / Yes, sir, I know, but I was in the middle of an experiment using some volatile compounds and I couldn't just leave them lying out --
 PICARD / Excuses, Mister Crusher?
 WESLEY / No, sir, not at all, it was more of an explanation --
 PICARD / Because I assure you that will not go over well at Starfleet Academy.
 WESLEY / I know, sir, but --
 WESLEY / The Academy?
 PICARD / I just got the message from Admiral Nsomeka. She expects you to report in two weeks.
 PICARD / A position has opened up in this year's class. You'll have to work overtime to catch up, but I have assured the Commander that you will be capable of that. Please don't make a liar of me.
 WESLEY / Oh, yes sir! I mean -- no, sir.
 PICARD / And as your final mission aboard the Enterprise... I'd like you to accompany me to Pentarus while I try to sort things out with the miners.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir...
 PICARD / Mister Riker tells me you've been studying the effects of outpost judiciary decisions on Federation Law. What better way to get first-hand experience?
 WORF / Captain, I am picking up a general distress signal from Gamelan Five.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Open channel. (to screen) I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / Mister Data, are we close enough for a scan?
 DATA / Nossir, we are out of range.
 RIKER / Any other ships near that system?
 DATA / Negative, Commander.
 PICARD / Very well. Chairman Songi, we will proceed immediately to your planet.
 PICARD / Mister Riker, take the Enterprise and investigate the problem. Ensign Crusher and I will proceed to Pentarus Five. (to Wes) The miners have sent a shuttle. We'll depart in ten minutes.
 GEORDI emerges from the miners' shuttle -- a small, / ragged vessel that looks like the space equivalent of "The African Queen". Its pilot, DIRGO, is a tough-looking humanoid who is weathered and worn enough to suggest middle-age. Though his appearance is feral, he will emerge as an intelligent, if inflexible, being.
 GEORDI / Your maneuvering thrusters are rigged in a configuration I haven't seen before.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) I've run operational and safety inspections, Captain. It checks out. I won't make any claims for comfort.
 PICARD / Ah -- Captain. Good to meet you.
 WESLEY / (sotto to Geordi) "Captain?" Of a mining shuttle?
 PICARD / It seems a very -- sturdy -- craft.
 PICARD / I'll let Ensign Crusher perform that task. I need to study up on Regalian law.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Bridge...
 RIKER / Go ahead, Mister Crusher.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Shuttlecraft Nenebek prepared for departure.
 RIKER / Acknowledged, Ensign. Begin launch sequence.
 WESLEY'S COM VOICE / Launch sequence confirmed...
 DATA / Shuttlecraft has cleared the bay.
 RIKER / Ensign Allenby, set a course for the Gamelan system... Warp Six.
 WESLEY / (dryly) Yes...
 WESLEY / Don't worry about Captain Picard -- he'll handle them.
 WESLEY / I've lost navigation --
 WESLEY / The port thruster module blew...
 PICARD / Is your navigational system functioning?
 PICARD / Estimated position... ?
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, scan for a class M environment...
 WESLEY / Aye, sir.
 WESLEY / (reading scanners) One of the moons of Pentarus Three... it's class M -- barely -- mean temperature fifty-five degrees Celsius...
 PICARD / Life forms indicated?
 WESLEY / Negative. But sensors are limited. There's an intense magnetic field near the surface.
 PICARD / Ensign, reconfigure the working thrusters to manual inputs.
 WESLEY / I'll try, sir -- but this grid looks about a hundred years old...
 WESLEY / (nods) We'll have to manually trip the bypass from the main engine to the thrusters...
 WESLEY / We've got power reconfigured, Captain.
 PICARD / Beginning braking maneuver.
 PICARD / Let's salvage what we can. (glancing upward) The first thing we'll need is shelter from the sun. In this heat, the shuttle will act like an oven.
 PICARD / We'll have to check the craft for something to protect our heads and eyes... and Captain, please recover your medical supplies... food and water rations...
 PICARD / But... food and water?
 PICARD / Surely... you have emergency supplies.
 PICARD / Are you telling me... that we have no water?
 DATA / Scanning. Vessel reads as an unmanned sublight freighter.
 RIKER / Origin?
 DATA / Indeterminate. Propulsion appears to employ a gaseous-core fission reactor, but it is not functioning.
 GEORDI / The radiation levels coming from that ship are off the scale.
 RIKER / Mister Data, could that be leakage from their engines?
 DATA / No sir. Engine reactor elements appear to have been inactive for approximately three hundred years. The vessel is carrying various unstable waste products.
 GEORDI / You mean... it's a garbage scow.
 DATA / Precisely.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. (beat) Chairman Songi, this is Commander Riker on board the Enterprise.
 RIKER / It appears you've inherited someone else's problem... It's an old waste vessel... caught by your planet's gravitational pull.
 BEVERLY / Have your people begun to suffer from radiation sickness?
 RIKER / We'll do our best to get it out of here as quickly as possible.
 RIKER / We're going to give that barge a push into the Gamelan sun.
 DATA / Sir, the Meltasion Asteroid Belt lies between here and the sun.
 RIKER / Then we'll have to take it ourselves and have our deflectors clear a safe path through the asteroids.
 GEORDI / I don't like the idea of getting close enough to that barge to tow it. The radiation levels are so high we'd be risking contamination of the entire crew.
 RIKER / Got a better idea, Geordi?
 GEORDI / We could send over a construction module to attach thrusters to it. Then we could direct it through the asteroid belt from a safe distance.
 WORF / Commander... a message from the mining settlement on Pentarus. The shuttle carrying Captain Picard has not yet arrived.
 BEVERLY / (surprised) They left here at oh-eight-hundred hours...
 WORF / They have asked if we will be starting a search.
 RIKER / Tell them we have an emergency situation here... we'll start a search after we've dealt with it.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, prepare to launch the construction module. Let's get this over with as fast as we can.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, any luck with that tricorder?
 WESLEY / I think so, sir. The scanning range may be limited, but it's better than nothing.
 PICARD / Excellent. Now -- (scanning the distance) Our communicators may not be able to get a signal through this strong a magnetic field... so I've fashioned an arrow. If a search party finds the wreckage, they'll know we've headed for those mountains.
 PICARD / We can't survive out here in the sun. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Where there are mountains, there is shelter.
 WESLEY / If you want to get out of this, I suggest you listen. Captain Picard is the one who's going to keep us alive --
 PICARD / (interrupting) Thank you, Ensign, that's enough.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Captain Dirgo, you're an able pilot and I welcome your input. Do you feel there's an alternative we're overlooking?
 PICARD / Very well. I suggest a steady pace, but not a brisk one. We need to ration our energy. Try to breathe through your nose, it will help prevent dehydration. I'll lead... Captain Dirgo, will you bring up the rear?
 WESLEY / And you were worried about how tough the Captain is?
 WESLEY / No... not yet...
 PICARD / Mister Crusher?
 WESLEY / I'm not sure, sir... an energy reading.
 PICARD / Energy reading? What kind?
 WESLEY / Low frequency E-M. It's been getting stronger... the closer we get to those mountains.
 WESLEY / I don't know what it is. It just registers as a repeating energy pattern...
 PICARD / Ensign, are you suggesting this energy is not naturally occurring?
 WESLEY / The readings could be indicating some electromagnetic property in the rocks... but I don't think so.
 PICARD / A life form?
 WESLEY / It's possible... the pattern's fairly organized...
 PICARD / We can't go back... and we can't stay here. We have to keep going to the mountains. No matter what's waiting there.
 PICARD / Not necessarily... they could have been created by volcanic activity -- lava flows. (turns from wall) These walls are dry... Mister Crusher, do you get any moisture reading?
 WESLEY / No, sir... But that E-M reading? The pattern has changed... and the frequency is peaking a lot higher...
 WESLEY / You have water!
 PICARD / Alcohol.
 PICARD / This won't quench your thirst... it will only make it worse.
 PICARD / I'm not going to let you waste this. It's more valuable to us as a coolant or a disinfectant.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher, stow this with the medical supplies and keep your eye on it.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Now we're going to explore this cave. Mister Crusher, look for any indication of water, no matter how faint. Captain Dirgo -- will you lead the way?
 BEVERLY / We're projecting that the bulk of the radiation will affect three small island groups.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Fortunately, they're sparsely populated. We'll start replicating hyronalin now and be ready to transport it to them if it becomes necessary. Please coordinate with the medical personnel on the planet.
 TROI / We've contacted the nearest Starbase for a search vessel... I'm afraid the closest one is almost a week away...
 BEVERLY / I see. Thank you.
 TROI / But we have asked the mining settlement to send out any vessels they might have.
 TROI / You know, there are many reasons why the shuttle might have been delayed...
 BEVERLY / Deanna -- thank you. But I'm all right. And for now, I have work to do.
 WORF / Commander... the miners report that they have very few operable shuttle craft. They want to know when we will be joining the search.
 RIKER / Tell them to stand by. If this works, we'll be on our way.
 GEORDI / Thrusters are attached and ready, Commander.
 RIKER / Initiate prefire sequence.
 GEORDI / Prefire command transmitted. Thrusters to standby.
 RIKER / Fire thrusters... gradual acceleration to forty percent power.
 GEORDI / We've lost one module. Correcting thrust vectors to compensate.
 DATA / Structural integrity of the barge has been compromised. Disintegration is continuing.
 RIKER / (standing) Shut down thrusters! Ensign, take us one thousand meters ahead of the barge and hold.
 DATA / External radiation levels are increasing.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, extend shields around the ship and lock on a tractor beam.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Allenby, set a new course. We're going to take it through the asteroid belt ourselves. One-quarter impulse.
 RIKER / (to comm) Doctor Crusher to the Bridge.
 RIKER / Data... I need a projection of the radiation impact on the crew... Worf... (beat) ... signal the mining settlement. Tell them -- we won't be joining the search for awhile.
 WESLEY / (re: the tricorder) Captain... water!
 PICARD / Mister Crusher... what was that?
 WESLEY / It seems to be some kind of tightly confined annular force field...
 PICARD / Put there to protect the water.
 WESLEY / Then there has to be a way to de-activate it...
 PICARD / I think it might be wiser if...
 WESLEY / (reading tricorder) The E-M pattern again -- the power level's really spiking now...
 PICARD / (warning) Dirgo...
 PICARD / Stop firing!
 WESLEY / Help me!
 WESLEY / Dirgo -- move!
 WESLEY / Keep pressure on that wound!
 WESLEY / This is the worst break... ?
 WESLEY / Keep the pressure constant.
 PICARD / Ensign... how bad is it?
 WESLEY / You have a broken leg... Your left arm is... I think there's a fracture there, too. And you took a bad blow to the head. But we're getting the bleeding under control.
 PICARD / (weakly) Good work... I'm going to be fine in a moment... just need to catch my breath...
 WESLEY / What truth?
 WESLEY / You don't know what you're talking about.
 PICARD / Mister Dirgo -- I'd appreciate it if you didn't bury me before I'm gone.
 PICARD / The trouble is... he may be right.
 WESLEY / No, he's not -- you're going to be fine...
 WESLEY / Captain... ?
 PICARD / (gently) For a moment... I saw your father's face in yours...
 PICARD / He wouldn't give up, either... even when things looked bleakest, even on that terrible afternoon...
 PICARD / Strange, I always remember it as night. Maybe... sudden, unnecessary death ought to happen at night... not on a bright cloudless afternoon...
 PICARD / Wesley... you're going to have to keep a rein on Dirgo... he's willful, stubborn... that could be dangerous...
 WESLEY / You'll handle him, sir.
 PICARD / (sharply) Listen to me. I have no feeling in my right leg. My vision is blurred... I'm going to get worse, not better. I won't be able to help you, Wesley. You'll have to stand up to him on your own.
 Wes stares at him, wishing he'd stop talking like this but -- WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Good man...
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, stardate 44307.6. Radiation levels on the Enterprise continue to rise. The ventilation system has started pumping hyronalin into our air supply to counteract the effects.
 DATA / At the rate the radiation levels are increasing, the hyronalin additive will only be effective for another thirty-eight minutes.
 BEVERLY / (to Comm) Crusher to Medical Unit One. Evacuate and seal off all non-operational areas. Group the crew and families in the interior corridors of decks nine and ten, radiation exposure protocol.
 RIKER / Data... at our current speed, how long will it take us to get through the asteroid belt?
 DATA / Fifty-one minutes, fourteen seconds.
 BEVERLY / We're going to have a lot of casualties if we can't get there any faster.
 RIKER / Geordi, how much more can the tractor beam take?
 GEORDI / We're already at the upper limit for towing speed, Commander.
 RIKER / Then let's see if we can establish a new upper limit...
 GEORDI / Aye, sir...
 GEORDI / Data, monitor the shearing effect on the beam... increasing to one-half impulse.
 DATA / Tractor beam is holding... shearing force eighty metric tons per meter...
 GEORDI / Increasing to three-quarters impulse.
 DATA / Shearing force ninety-two metric tons... ninety-three... tractor beam is destabilizing... we are going to lose the barge, Commander...
 RIKER / (no choice) Reduce power.
 RIKER / Geordi, you gotta stabilize the tractor beam...
 GEORDI / (mind racing) I can't divert any more power to the shields... we're already hitting maximum thermal limits... (beat) Only other choice is to bring some other fusion reactors on line... but we're running at peak coolant pressure...
 RIKER / Do it.
 WESLEY / How did this happen?
 WESLEY / Selenium fibers... electrically deposited.
 WESLEY / The E-M pattern is back down... it only surged when we tried to get to the water... (moves back toward Dirgo) Whatever it was we saw... it almost acts like a sentry. To guard the fountain. (checking tricorder) As long as we aren't moving toward the water, the wave pattern stays low... right between five and fifteen hertz... Dirgo, walk toward the fountain.
 WESLEY / That's it! The frequency went to forty.
 WESLEY / If I could find a way to manipulate the frequency, I might be able to control it. (beat, thoughtful) The Sentry appeared when we started using phasers. Maybe it responds to heat... or to collinated energy...
 WESLEY / Hold on... we need to figure out what it is, before we start doing anything to it.
 WESLEY / No, we can't...
 WESLEY / And how do you know it'll go for my phaser, not yours?
 WESLEY / There's no evidence that it responds differently to higher settings... we have to figure out our options before we --
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, supplemental. Mister La Forge has diverted power from auxiliary fusion generators in an attempt to stabilize the tractor beam. This is the only hope of increasing our towing speed so we can clear the asteroid belt before radiation levels become fatal.
 GEORDI / Ready, Commander. I'll be rotating the output of the auxiliary reactors, but it should still give us the power we need.
 RIKER / Proceed, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Increasing to three-quarters impulse.
 DATA / Shearing force at one hundred three metric tons... the tractor beam is stable...
 GEORDI / Full impulse.
 DATA / Tractor beam is holding.
 WORF / We are in visual range of the asteroid belt.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / Stand by to cut the barge loose...
 DATA / We have cleared the asteroids, sir.
 RIKER / Let it go.
 DATA / Radiation intensity is decreasing, Commander.
 RIKER / Cancel red alert.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, contact the mining settlement. Tell them we are joining the search for Captain Picard. (beat) Ensign, set a new course. Warp nine.
 PICARD / Cold...
 WESLEY / When the sun went down, the temperature really dropped. (indicating fire) This should help.
 PICARD / ... don't seem to be much good to you, Wesley...
 WESLEY / (hard for him to admit) Sir... Dirgo is dead.
 WESLEY / I should've tried harder to stop him...
 WESLEY / Sir?
 WESLEY / Captain? (no response; louder) Captain Picard!
 WESLEY / Sir... please... stay with me...
 PICARD / I'm... trying...
 WESLEY / Captain? Remember when we took the shuttlecraft to Starbase Five-One-Five? I was dreading it... six hours alone with you...
 WESLEY / But it didn't turn out the way I thought it would... you kind of -- opened up to me. I got to know you. (beat) Sort of.
 PICARD / (with great effort) ... it's my fault you're here... I shouldn't have asked you...
 WESLEY / I was honored you wanted me along...
 PICARD / ... I was selfish... knew I might not see you again... forgive me...
 WESLEY / Sir... the past three years... I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime...
 WESLEY / I think I've been pretty lucky... no matter what happens. How many people get to serve with -- with Jean-Luc Picard?
 WESLEY / You don't know this... nobody knows this, because I never told anybody... but a lot of what I've worked for... school, and science projects, and getting into the Academy... I've done it because... because...
 WESLEY / (quietly) Because I wanted you to be proud of me.
 WESLEY / One thing I learned from you... is that you never quit. And I'm not quitting now. I've seen you think yourself out of worse problems... and I'm going to think us out of this one.
 WESLEY / You're not going to die... I won't let you die. I'll get to the water and I'll keep you alive until they find us. I promise you.
 RIKER / Are you certain?
 DATA / It is definitely debris. The primary material is duranium, with smaller proportions of sonodanite and ermanium.
 GEORDI / Most shuttlecraft hulls are made of duranium.
 BEVERLY / Then, they're gone.
 DATA / Not necessarily, Doctor. There is far too little debris to account for an entire shuttlecraft.
 RIKER / So what is it?
 GEORDI / Dirgo had his maneuvering thrusters rigged in a funny way... he claimed it was more efficient. If one of them blew... it might have left debris like that.
 RIKER / If only one of his thrusters were out... he could still have put down somewhere.
 DATA / The only Class M planets in the system are Pentarus Two and Five... both have been thoroughly searched by the miners.
 RIKER / Then, we'll search them again.
 DATA / Sir... there are also four moons in the Pentarus system that might support life...
 RIKER / Have the miners searched them?
 WORF / Not yet, sir.
 RIKER / What's the closest one to the debris coordinates?
 DATA / Lambda Paz, one of the moons of Pentarus Three.
 RIKER / (to Conn) Set a course, Ensign.
 PICARD / Ensign... where are we?
 WESLEY / We crashed, sir... we're in a cave...
 PICARD / ... need water...
 WESLEY / We -- we don't have any water. Don't you remember? We tried to get to the fountain... and Captain Dirgo...
 PICARD / Yes... I remember...
 WESLEY / But I think I'm on to something. I've analyzed the sentry's electrical patterns.
 PICARD / Wesley... I may not make it...
 WESLEY / I'm going to get to the water... I took the transponder element from my communicator... used it to modify the tricorder...
 WESLEY / I think I can use it to interrupt the sentry's energy pattern... stop it. (beat) Or at least slow it down...
 PICARD / Listen to me...
 WESLEY / Yes, sir?
 PICARD / So much I've wanted to tell you. (beat) At the Academy, there is someone... who meant a great deal to me... he has been there "forever"... you must get to know him... his name is Boothby... tell him we were friends...
 PICARD / When I was there... he helped me... Listen to him...
 WESLEY / What does he teach?
 PICARD / He's the groundskeeper. One of the wisest men I ever knew... (beat) I envy you, Wesley... it is just the beginning of the adventure for you.
 PICARD / Go on, get the water, stay alive... they'll find you.
 WESLEY / I'll be back soon.
 PICARD / Wesley...
 PICARD / Always remember... I was... proud of you...
 WESLEY / (amazed) It worked... !
 WESLEY / Captain Picard? Wake up...
 DATA / There is an intense magnetic field, Commander. I am getting an anomalous reading... but it is not strong enough to interpret accurately.
 GEORDI / I can narrow the frequency range on the sensor array... and try to enhance the signal... (works for a beat) Any better, Data?
 DATA / Yes. The reflection signature now clearly indicates that it is metal... duranium. The probablity is quite high that it is the shuttlecraft.
 RIKER / Any life signs?
 DATA / It is impossible to determine. The magnetic flux would mask any bio-energy emanations.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, will that interference affect the Transporter Beam?
 WORF / Yes, Commander. An Away Team would have to take a shuttlecraft.
 RIKER / Assemble your team, Mister Data.
 BEVERLY / I'm going with you.
 DATA / Of course. Lieutenant Worf?
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Wesley?
 WESLEY / Mom!
 BEVERLY / Oh, Wesley... thank God...
 WESLEY / I'm sure glad to see you...
 WESLEY / How did you find us?
 DATA / We found the wreckage -- and the arrow which indicated your direction.
 BEVERLY / (to assistants) We'll take Wesley by stretcher, too.
 WESLEY / I can walk.
 PICARD / (weakly) Beverly...
 BEVERLY / We're on our way back to the Enterprise, Captain... we've stabilized your vital signs.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher...
 PICARD / A moment...
 PICARD / I want you all to know...
 PICARD / (to the others) He saved my life...
 PICARD / Wesley, know this... you will be missed.
 TROI / "Given in" to what?
 TROI / (gently) Or maybe some of us aren't really facing it at all.
 TROI / (continuing) Sometimes, we suffer more than our suffering requires.
 TROI / Recovery from a great loss involves a great deal of pain. If we try to avoid that pain we only make it harder on ourselves in the long run.
 TROI / Then why did you come to see me?
 TROI / Today would have been your husband's thirty-eighth birthday.
 TROI / They didn't take everything away.
 PICARD, DATA, RIKER, WORF at their positions. ENSIGN / ALLENBY is at Conn.
 PICARD / (rising) ... An ancient trail along the Kabul River in the Himalayas... it's a wonderful program... Will, it'll do you good to get a little fresh Holodeck air...
 RIKER / Thanks anyway, but my horsemanship is a little too rusty to take on the Himalayas.
 PICARD / (teasing) Nonsense. We'll program an appropriately docile steed for you and...
 WORF / (alarmed, interrupting) Captain! Sensors indicate a vast field of...
 PICARD / Of what, Lieutenant?
 WORF / (surprised) It's gone. But something did appear to be directly in our path.
 RIKER / A sensor echo, Data?
 DATA / Uncertain... I have no unusual readings, Commander.
 TROI / (disoriented) What... ?
 TROI / No, I'm okay. Very... tired, that's all.
 TROI / Yes... Will I see you tomorrow?
 TROI / Of course.
 DATA / An aggregate field of plane-polarized objects has just appeared... (puzzled) And disappeared.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Recommend we run a diagnostic on the forward sensor array. We don't want a ghost tailing us all the way to T'lli Beta.
 WORF / I'm not convinced it is a ghost, Commander. There may be something there...
 PICARD / Ensign Allenby, full stop. We'll investigate both possibilities.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44356.9. Sensor diagnostic has been completed and indicates that all systems are normal. There remains no explanation for the images which appeared in our path.
 DATA / I have completed another full scan of the area, sir. There is no further indication of the anomaly...
 PICARD / Prepare to resume course to T'lli Beta, Ensign. Mister Data, what velocity will put us back on schedule?
 DATA / An immediate resumption of our course at warp six will place us in the T'lli Beta system in six days, thirteen hours and forty-seven minutes.
 RIKER / What, no seconds?
 DATA / I have discovered, Sir, a certain level of impatience when I calculate a lengthy time interval to the nearest second. However, if you wish...
 RIKER / (sorry he asked) No, no. Minutes is fine.
 PICARD / Ensign, set course and stand ready at warp six.
 PICARD / Engage.
 RIKER / Riker to Engineering... what the hell happened, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Checking... looks like the field collapsed before we could enter warp...
 RIKER / Reason?
 GEORDI / Damned if I know. There doesn't seem to be any permanent damage to the nacelles. Recommend full stop while I check it out...
 PICARD / (nods) Back to full stop, Ensign.
 DATA / All decks reporting. Minor injuries only.
 PICARD / Damage?
 DATA / None.
 WORF / Weapons and shields normal.
 RIKER / Go to yellow alert.
 TROI / (touching insignia) Troi to Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Yes, Deanna?
 BEVERLY is in the midst of a Sickbay busy with / attendants preparing for the rush of patients.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Beverly, I'm feeling very... dizzy...
 BEVERLY / Did you hit your head... ?
 TROI / I'm not sure. I'm not sure what happened.
 BEVERLY / Lie down, breathe deeply, stay calm... we've got calls coming in from all over the ship. I'll be there as soon as I can.
 RIKER / Whatever's pulling us sure isn't in a hurry...
 PICARD / Picard to La Forge.
 GEORDI / Go ahead, Captain.
 PICARD / If your engines are functional, we'll attempt to break free.
 GEORDI / Everything down here seems normal enough, sir... but I suggest we take it a little slower this time...
 PICARD / Ensign, bring us around ninety degrees to starboard from our current heading...
 PICARD / One-quarter impulse. Engage.
 PICARD / One-half impulse.
 PICARD / Full impulse... rotate heading in five degree increments.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / La Forge?
 GEORDI / There's nothing wrong down here! The engines are fine!
 DATA / Integrity field stress now exceeding eighty-two million kilo-dynes. Recommend immediate shutdown.
 PICARD / Ensign.
 BEVERLY / (apologetic) I got here as quickly as I could. We've got a Sickbay filled with headaches. How are you?
 TROI / I was feeling intense pain when I first called you. Now it's gone. But I'm still a bit... foggy.
 BEVERLY / I'd like to take you to Sickbay and run an internuncial series. I'm getting some unusual readings. Can you walk?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / All senior staff report to the Observation Lounge.
 BEVERLY / Are you up to that?
 TROI / Yes, I think so.
 BEVERLY / Is something wrong?
 TROI / (shaking it off) No, I'm fine.
 RIKER / Could it be some sort of tractor beam?
 DATA / No other ship is indicated.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, your analysis.
 WORF / Tactical sensor readings were indeterminant.
 GEORDI / (agrees) They don't even give us enough for an educated guess.
 RIKER / (frowns) And yet all sensors are operating properly.
 PICARD / Can there be an intelligence at work here?
 PICARD / Counselor, do you sense a lifeform out there?
 TROI / I don't think so... No, there's nothing...
 TROI / (continuing) Nothing. (realizing) Strange, I sense... nothing.
 PICARD / It's alright, Counsellor. Perhaps there's nothing out there to sense.
 DATA / Indeed, there are many races that are not empathically detectable. The Breen, the Ferengi, the --
 TROI / -- No, you don't understand. I don't sense anything. Not out there, not in here. All of you, you're blank to me.
 RIKER / Deanna.
 BEVERLY / There's no indication of a concussion or a blow to the head... just a pattern of unresponsive neural cells throughout the cerebellum and cerebral cortex...
 TROI / Unresponsive?
 BEVERLY / (a beat, frank) There's brain damage. How serious... I can't tell yet.
 TROI / But I feel fine otherwise.
 RIKER / Can you treat it?
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure. I'll have to study up on Betazoid physiology.
 TROI / The Betazoid brain has a remarkable ability to heal itself... this condition could reverse itself over time.
 BEVERLY / It might. But you are half-human. That changes the map a little. I just don't want to offer you any false hope.
 TROI / It's just hope, Beverly. Not false hope.
 RIKER / What would cause something like this... ?
 RIKER / (I'm asking that question... ) ... because it happened to her at just about the same time we encountered the anomaly.
 BEVERLY / (nods) There may be a connection... I don't know. (beat, to Troi) If you were anyone else, you know the first thing I'd do? (off her look) I'd send you to Counselor Troi.
 TROI / Well, then I have an advantage, don't I... I see her quite often...
 BEVERLY / Deanna, it's no different than one of us suddenly going blind...
 TROI / (impatient) Doctor, you don't have to tell me... I understand the psychology...
 BEVERLY / You may understand it... but you've never had to live with it.
 TROI / I may be perfectly fine by tomorrow.
 BEVERLY / And you may not be. Now I'll do my homework... I'll see if there's anything we can do to regenerate those cells... but in the meantime, I want you to talk to someone... there are several people on board with degrees in psychology...
 TROI / (laughs, interrupting) Fine. Fine. Okay. If I need to. All I want to do now is go back to work.
 RIKER / Deanna...
 TROI / If there are no medical objections...
 BEVERLY / No... medical objections.
 TROI / Thank you, Beverly. (perfunctory smile) Will.
 TROI / Come in.
 RIKER / I don't have a psychology degree but if you want to talk...
 TROI / You know what the worst part of this is... and I've seen it happen with so many patients...
 RIKER / What?
 TROI / It's the way other people change. How they start to treat you differently.
 TROI / They walk on egg shells around you. Sometimes they avoid you altogether. Sometimes they become overbearing -- 'reach out a helping hand to the blind woman'...
 RIKER / I'm sorry if...
 TROI / Well, I won't be treated that way.
 RIKER / Hey, Imzadi...
 TROI / (give me a break) Oh, please...
 RIKER / (softly) I've never seen you... quite so scared.
 TROI / I'm fine. If I get better, I get better. If not, I adapt. Life goes on.
 TROI / I'm a little busy now.
 RIKER / Deanna --
 TROI / -- I really must finish this. I have some appointments this afternoon.
 DATA / Probe launch is successful. (beat) Telemetry transmissions are being received.
 GEORDI / Let's see what we've got.
 GEORDI / Nothing unusual here... same readings as the ship sensors.
 DATA / (touching controls) Expanding analysis parameters. Applying Bayesian functions... broad E-M and subspace spectrum polling...
 GEORDI / (nothing) Uh Uh... No change...
 DATA / I am now adding virtual particle trajectories...
 GEORDI / Whoa. What is that?
 DATA / Unknown. I am attempting to analyze motion patterns... results still inconclusive.
 GEORDI / Last time I saw anything like that, I was skindiving off the Coral Reef on Bracas Five.
 TROI (V.O.) / Counselor's personal log, stardate 44357.1. I hear their words, I see their faces, I know the techniques of therapy... and yet it all forms an incomplete equation. I am without insight. How do I help these people?
 TROI / You said you woke up 'a new woman' this morning.
 TROI / Tell me about her - this new woman...
 TROI / She's not?
 TROI / You feel different, now.
 TROI / Can I share something important with you?
 TROI / I'm having a very difficult time today. And I feel you need to know.
 TROI / I've temporarily lost my empathic sense. (smiles) It's kind of like having one hand tied behind your back.
 TROI / No, no, I'm fine. It's just... I feel before we continue it's important you know that. Okay... ?
 TROI / Because I can't tell how you feel this morning, but it... it seems to me... one night of crying can't make up for months of pretending.
 DATA / The probe's point of view reveals that the objects exist entirely in two dimensions. On a single plane.
 GEORDI / They have length and width, but no height. Virtually flat.
 DATA / That is why the ship's forward sensors did not detect them at first. We were looking at them along their edge. There was no surface to read. I will illustrate.
 PICARD / Are they a lifeform?
 DATA / (nods to screen) The movement pattern within the cluster is not a naturally occuring phenomenon in the Newtonian sense. The objects appear to be alive.
 RIKER / Can you explain why they're pulling us along with them?
 GEORDI / Somehow, they polarize the graviton field around them as they move. We're caught in the wake.
 RIKER / So how do we get out of it?
 GEORDI / We've processed the limited information from the probe... best idea for now is to try a controlled overload of the warp drive... jump directly to warp six. The laws of a three-dimensional universe say it should work. Not so sure about a two-dimensional universe though.
 PICARD / Fascinating. So many questions... how could a two dimensional entity have access to a three dimensional universe... and are they even aware of us... ? (moving back) Number One, if we can put off the T'lli Betans, I'd like to stay and investigate once we're free of this graviton field...
 GEORDI / It's too bad we can't tell if they're sentient.
 TROI / (defensively) What do you mean by that?
 TROI / (continuing) I'm doing the best I can.
 PICARD / No one has suggested otherwise, Counselor.
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister Data, try to isolate any signal patterns from the cluster. Perhaps we'll find a basis for communication. Commander La Forge, we'll attempt your warp jump as soon as you're prepared... (to everyone) That'll be all.
 PICARD / Counselor --
 BEVERLY / How are you feeling?
 TROI / Beverly, I can't do my job. I'm absolutely lost. You've got to do something.
 BEVERLY / I cross-referenced your scan results with the baseline files in the computer. Nothing helpful turned up. And so far the lab work is inconclusive.
 TROI / Inconclusive. What does that mean?
 BEVERLY / It means there's nothing I can do now. I'm still trying...
 TROI / (interrupting) How do you people live like this?
 BEVERLY / (beat) We get by pretty well actually. And so will you. In time.
 TROI / You have no idea. No idea what this is like. How can you know what it's like to lose something you've never had?
 BEVERLY / I don't claim to...
 TROI / But you're telling me I'm supposed to get used to it.
 BEVERLY / If our positions were reversed, what would you tell me?
 TROI / If our positions were reversed, I wouldn't have been in here treating skinned elbows while you were passed out on your office floor. I would have been there a lot sooner... maybe in time to prevent this before it ever happened.
 TROI / I've been working with Ensign Brooks since the death of her husband... she's avoided the reality of what happened... denied it to herself... and I realize I've been doing the same thing about my condition.
 PICARD / That's perfectly understandable...
 TROI / It's time I accept the truth, Captain. (beat) And resign as ship's counselor.
 PICARD / (reacts) Resign... ?
 TROI / I can no longer fulfill my obligations. What other option is there?
 PICARD / Deanna, I have been fortunate in having had access to your Betazoid abilities. Most starship captains must be content with human counselors. Empathic awareness is not a requirement for the position.
 TROI / (unyielding) It is for me.
 PICARD / I'm sure after awhile you'll be able to compensate. They say when one loses a sense, the other senses become stronger to help adjust... a blind man develops better hearing...
 TROI / With all due respect, Captain, you don't know what you're talking about.
 TROI / (continuing) That is a common belief which has no scientific basis... no doubt created by normal people who feel uncomfortable around the disabled. (beat) I am disabled. And I'm telling you I cannot perform my duties.
 PICARD / (a beat) There was a teacher of mine at the Academy who had been confined to a wheelchair since birth...
 TROI / (interrupting, softly) Spare me the inspirational anecdote and accept my resignation, Captain.
 PICARD / Counselor Troi has just resigned.
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / I really would rather be alone right now.
 RIKER / Too bad.
 TROI / (humor through tears) Is this how you handle all of your personnel problems?
 RIKER / Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi or Worf...
 TROI / Will, I don't know what to do.
 RIKER / So you resign, cut yourself off from all the people who care for you...
 TROI / I look around me and all I see are surfaces without depth. Colorless and hollow. Nothing seems real.
 RIKER / I'm real.
 TROI / No, you're not! You're a projection. With no more substance to me than a character on the Holodeck.
 RIKER / I don't believe that.
 TROI / You have no idea how frightening it is for me to just be here without sensing you, without sharing your feelings...
 RIKER / That's it, isn't it... we're on equal footing now...
 TROI / What do you mean?
 RIKER / You've always had an advantage... a little bit of control over every situation... it must have been a very safe position to be in.
 RIKER / (kidding on the square) To be honest, I always thought there was something a little too aristocratic about your Betazoid heritage. It's as if the human side wasn't quite good enough for you.
 TROI / That isn't true.
 RIKER / Isn't it?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Riker...
 RIKER / Go ahead, Geordi...
 GEORDI / We're ready to attempt a controlled overload jump to warp six.
 RIKER / Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge.
 RIKER / (to Deanna) I'll check in on you later.
 TROI / Really, you don't have to...
 RIKER / I'll check in on you later.
 GEORDI / Engaging impulse engines, now.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go to warp, Geordi.
 RIKER / Status?
 DATA / Integrity field pressure has increased by two hundred seventeen percent, Captain.
 PICARD / Disengage all engines!
 GEORDI / Engines disengaged, sir.
 RIKER / La Forge, report...
 GEORDI / The energy we wanted to transfer to the nacelles was absorbed by the graviton wake instead. It set up a torsional wave that rebounded back to the ship. We're lucky the hull is still in one piece.
 PICARD / This little nuisance is quickly losing its fascination.
 DATA / Sir, during our attempt to break away , I recorded a momentary alteration of the movement pattern within the cluster.
 RIKER / You think we got their attention, Data?
 DATA / Possibly. But only for an instant. The pattern immediately returned to its previous dynamic.
 PICARD / Follow up on it, Mister Data. Input your observations into the Universal Translator. Perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt at communication.
 DATA / Aye, Captain.
 TROI / That's alright. I'm getting used to it.
 TROI / (honestly) No.
 TROI / No.
 TROI / (smiles) You'd make a good counselor...
 TROI / (reacts) About what... you becoming a counselor?
 TROI / (awkward) Well, it's more than just letting them cry on your shoulder... it takes an enormous commitment...
 TROI / Guinan, people come to you to talk about things they want to reveal. A ship's counselor has to get people to talk about things they don't want to reveal.
 TROI / Guinan... what are you doing... ? (beat) You don't really want to be ship's counselor...
 TROI / I just know you're not serious.
 TROI / Well, not really, but...
 TROI / No. I suppose it's just... instinctive.
 TROI / Ah, I get it. You're trying to make me see that I have other abilities to draw on... human intuition, instincts... but those skills only develop with years of experience, Guinan... it's not so easy...
 TROI / So I'm discovering.
 TROI / Guinan...
 TROI / (not serious, 'thank-you') If you want, I'll put in a good word with the Captain about the job...
 RIKER / Problem, Data?
 DATA / Yes, Commander. Sensors are detecting highly accelerated interstellar gases...
 RIKER / Suggesting?
 DATA / Uncertain, Commander. The phenomenon is within visual range.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / Magnify.
 DATA / It appears to be a cosmic string fragment, sir. Only one hundred seven kilometers long.
 RIKER / They're no wider than a proton and have gravitational fields as powerful as a black hole.
 DATA / The two-dimensional beings seem to be caught in the gravitational pull of the string. Their course is taking them directly toward it.
 RIKER / And us right along with them.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44359.5. What began as a curious inconvenience has turned into a serious threat. At current speed, the two-dimensional beings and the Enterprise will be drawn into the cosmic string fragment in seven hours.
 DATA / The entities offer no indication that they are aware of the string fragment, Captain. Their course and speed remain constant...
 WORF / Sir, recommend we fire a spread of photon torpedoes into their field.
 PICARD / Must we destroy them to save ourselves...
 DATA / It is not clear what affect a photon torpedo would have on a two-dimensional being, Captain.
 PICARD / Nevertheless...
 GEORDI / We don't necessarily have to fire at them. Half-a-dozen photon torpedo bursts directly in their path could make them change course.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 WORF / Torpedoes armed. Fire distribution set. Detonation at seven kilometers ahead of the cluster.
 RIKER / Data, launch another probe and patch the monitor through to the main viewer.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Probe has been launched. On screen.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, proceed.
 WORF / Launching photon torpedoes.
 WORF / Five seconds to detonation... Three, two, one.
 DATA / No change in the graviton field. (looks up) The torpedoes are having no effect.
 PICARD / (frowns, no choice) Fire another volley directly into their field, Mister Worf.
 WORF (O.C.) / Launching torpedoes. (beat) Five seconds to detonation... Three, two, one.
 DATA (O.C.) / No affect, sir. Matter anti-matter explosions appear to be ineffective.
 TROI / Yes?
 TROI / (continuing; surprised) Janet. I'm sorry... I meant to cancel your appointment today...
 TROI / Janet, I've resigned as ship's counselor.
 TROI / (a beat) Well, I think it was fairly clear during your last appointment... it was obviously non-productive and...
 TROI / (reacts) But I couldn't sense what you were...
 TROI / You wanted to see me, Captain?
 PICARD / Sit down, please.
 PICARD / (continuing) Our situation has become critical. The cluster is still completely unresponsive. We have not been able to alter its course toward the cosmic string fragment.
 TROI / How much time do we have?
 PICARD / Less than five hours. That's why I've called you.
 TROI / Sir?
 PICARD / All that remains is the possibility of communication. There might be some way to warn them of their impending destruction.
 TROI / I thought Data already tried to establish communications through the universal translator.
 PICARD / He has tried every technical means at our disposal to reach them.
 TROI / Captain, I wish I knew how to help. But under the cirumstances...
 PICARD / If there is a psychology to these creatures, we must discover it... if there is an explanation to their behavior, we must know it...
 PICARD / Even in your current condition, you are the most qualified person aboard this ship to assist.
 PICARD / (continuing) Data is currently in Observation, attempting to formulate a strategy. I'd like you to join him.
 PICARD / Deanna. We need you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. If our speed and course remain unchanged, in one hour, the Enterprise will be torn apart by the gravitational forces of the cosmic string fragment.
 TROI / Are your signals reaching them at all?
 DATA / Possibly. However, the beings may perceive them as negligible noise rather than an attempt at communication.
 TROI / Is there any evidence at all that they're sentient?
 DATA / Negative. The nature of their movement suggests a simple order of intelligence.
 TROI / I'm sorry, Data... I don't seem to be much help without my empathic abilities... I just don't know how to draw on my human instinct...
 DATA / As I have no human 'instinct' per se, I cannot advise you, Counselor.
 TROI / Right now, I feel as two-dimensional as our friends out there... in this universe, but barely aware of it... (musing) ... just trying to survive on...
 TROI / Instinct?
 TROI / Data, what if they're simply acting instinctively... there are inherent, inborn forces that drive every species. What they need. What they fear. (beat) We've got to discover what drives this species?
 DATA / I do not believe there is any way to know for certain, Counselor.
 TROI / We can speculate based on the available evidence...
 DATA / The only evidence we have at present is the brief interruption in their movement pattern during our last attempt to break away...
 TROI / (mind working) Which may suggest some kind of awareness of our presence...
 DATA / Otherwise their course and speed have been constant.
 TROI / On a straight line to the cosmic string... (beat) You're convinced the string's gravitation is pulling them in.
 DATA / Since the cluster is two-dimensional, I have no direct evidence to support that assumption. But it is the most reasonable hypothesis.
 TROI / Why?
 DATA / It is unlikely they would intentionally move toward a destructive force...
 TROI / Moths fly toward a flame. Horses sometimes run into a burning barn. Data, don't you see, we've been thinking in three-dimensions. We have to get two-dimensional.
 DATA / Pardon me?
 TROI / Subspace signals, photon torpedoes, nothing's had an impact... it is reasonable to wonder if a gravitational pull... even as strong as a cosmic string's... would affect them.
 DATA / (curious where she's heading) Please continue.
 TROI / What if they've chosen a course to the cosmic string? A case of pure stimulus-response. Driven by instinct... just like the moth to a flame...
 DATA / If Counselor Troi's supposition is correct, Captain... a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could induce them to reverse course. Disrupting the graviton wake long enough for us to escape.
 RIKER / How do you simulate a cosmic string? It has the gravitational force of a hundred stars.
 DATA / I do not suggest we simulate the gravitational field of the string fragment, Commander. Rather the string's vibration.
 PICARD / Vibration. This isn't a violin, Commander.
 GEORDI / Data's right. The principle is the same. A cosmic string emanates a characteristic set of subspace frequencies as atomic particles decay along its event horizon. I could use the ship's parabolic dish to amplify and reflect those frequencies back toward the cluster. The Enterprise itself would echo the cosmic string.
 PICARD / (reacts) How much time do we have, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Twenty-three minutes.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / Frequency scan detectors engaged.
 GEORDI / Receiving...
 GEORDI / Data... we're picking up frequencies across the entire electromagnetic and lower subspace spectrum... trying to isolate...
 GEORDI / Can you focus the reflector field for me?
 DATA / Stand by... (working panels) I am differentiating particle emission signatures now.
 GEORDI / That's doing it... Patterns are converging...
 WORF / We are beginning to encounter the gravitational effects of the string. Impact is in four minutes...
 DATA / Sir, the shear force turbulence is impairing our ability to create an accurate simulation...
 RIKER / Geordi, fire up the impulse engines and activate the ship's stabilizers...
 GEORDI / Stabilizers on.
 DATA / Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization.
 WORF / Three minutes to impact.
 RIKER / Status?
 PICARD / Let's try to turn up the volume. Increase intensity, Mister Data.
 DATA / Increasing by fifty percent.
 GEORDI / Graviton wake field collapsing.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, take us out of here.
 GEORDI / My pleasure, sir.
 PICARD / Excellent work, Mister Data; (nodding to Troi) Counselor.
 TROI / (pleasantly surprised) It's all right. They're home. We were wrong. The cosmic string... it was never dangerous to them... it was the one place in the galaxy they most wanted to be.
 RIKER / ('you've recovered') Deanna... ?
 TROI / Yes... I sensed it...
 TROI / Such overwhelming intensity of emotion. When we first encountered them, it must have been more than my senses could process.
 RIKER / A short-circuit.
 TROI / Something like that. (apologetic) Beverly...
 BEVERLY / Apology accepted. (to Riker) Therapists are always the worst patients. Except for doctors, of course. Stop by and see me later, okay... ?
 TROI / I was so awful to her.
 TROI / I never fully appreciated how difficult... and rewarding... it is to be human... (to Guinan) I had a lot of help. Thank-you.
 TROI / It's been taken.
 TROI / And you, Will Riker... Thank you for making me face my other half.
 RIKER / (joking) Frightening, wasn't it?
 TROI / A little. (shrugs) You were right, though. Maybe there's something to be learned when you're not in control of every situation.
 RIKER / Welcome to the human race.
 TROI / By the way. The next time you call me aristocratic...
 DATA (V.O.) / Second Officer's Personal Log: Stardate 44390.1 Record entry for transmission to Commander Bruce Maddox, Cybernetics Division, Daystrom Institute. Dear Commander Maddox,...
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) In reference to your most recent letter, I agree that your study lacks sufficient primary source information on my programming. Therefore in response to your request, this correspondence will include a complete record of my activities during a normal day, focusing on my perceptions of friendship.
 RIKER, and THREE SUPERNUMERARIES ENTER from Turbolift. / Data stands.
 DATA / Good morning, Commander. You are fifteen minutes early.
 RIKER / Well, it's a special day. I thought the... father of the bride would enjoy being relieved a little early on the wedding day.
 DATA / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / Nervous?
 DATA / I cannot become nervous. However, I do sense a certain... anticipation regarding my role in the wedding. (beat) All systems normal, sir. Sickbay reported that Lieutenant Juarez went into labor at zero four hundred hours. We remain on station awaiting the arrival of the starship Zhukov and guest quarters have been prepared for Ambassador T'Pel.
 RIKER / Very well. I have the Bridge.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (to com) Begin day watch.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) Initially Commander Maddox, I found it difficult to maintain friendships since human emotions are often puzzling to me.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing over above action) Eventually, I developed a program enabling me to predict human emotional responses to specific actions.
 DATA / It is time for the wedding rehearsal.
 DATA / You do not wish to rehearse?
 DATA / May I ask why?
 DATA / Have your feelings for Chief O'Brien changed?
 DATA / Will cancelling the wedding make you happy?
 DATA / If you wish.
 DATA (V.O.) / I have often heard my friend Chief O'Brien say that above all else, he wants to make Keiko happy. Since cancelling the wedding will make her happy, I must conclude the Chief will be pleased at her decision.
 GEORDI, O'BRIEN, and SUPERNUMERARIES. The / Supernumeraries are putting up Japanese lanterns, decorations, etc. Geordi and O'Brien are standing around, waiting for the rehearsal. (The lounge is closed, no regular patrons.) Data ENTERS and goes directly to O'Brien.
 DATA / I have good news.
 DATA / Yes. Keiko has made a decision designed to increase her happiness. (beat) She has cancelled the wedding.
 GEORDI / Next time, maybe I should break the... good news.
 DATA (V.O.) / Commander Maddox, it would appear that my program designed to predict emotional responses needs... adjustment.
 DATA (V.O.) / Personal Log: Supplemental. This is the one thousand five hundred fiftieth day since the Enterprise was commissioned.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) Besides the arrival of Ambassador T'Pel, other events occurring today include four birthdays, two personnel transfers, a celebration of the Hindu Festival of Lights, two chess tournaments, one secondary school play, and four promotions.
 DATA (V.O.) / Overall... an ordinary day.
 DATA / Energize.
 DATA / Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador.
 DATA (V.O.) / Unlike my human friends, I am not affected by feelings or emotional considerations. In that sense, I am closer to being Vulcan than human, but I am not attracted to Vulcan philosophy. Their devotion to logic does have a certain appeal in its simple purity...
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) ... but I find theirs to be a somewhat... stark philosophy, lacking beauty... and joy.
 PICARD and Riker standing near the desk. T'Pel and / Data ENTER.
 PICARD / Ambassador T'Pel...
 PICARD / Your service honors us. (gestures) My first officer, Commander William Riker.
 RIKER / (annoyed, to Data) Charming woman.
 DATA (V.O.) / The tone of Commander Riker's voice makes me suspect that he is not serious about finding Ambassador T'Pel charming. My experience suggests that in fact he may mean the exact opposite of what he says. This is a form of expression I have not yet been able to master.
 GEORDI / (joking) Hey, I wouldn't be back here so soon if you'd done it right the first time...
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) When I have difficulty understanding human behavior I often turn to Commander Geordi La Forge. I consider him to be... my best friend.
 GEORDI / Just try to keep my ears on straight today, all right?
 DATA (V.O.) / Friendly insults and jibes... another form of human speech that I am attempting to master.
 GEORDI / (to Data) Hi... here for a trim?
 DATA / My hair does not require trimming... you peabrain.
 GEORDI / What?
 DATA / My hair...
 GEORDI / 'Peabrain'?
 DATA / I am experimenting with friendly insults and jibes. It was not meant as a serious disparagement.
 GEORDI / (laughs) Well... I wouldn't try it out on the Captain.
 DATA / Geordi, I am still confused about Chief O'Brien's reaction this morning.
 GEORDI / He was just surprised, Data. He didn't mean to blow up like that. He knows Keiko probably doesn't want to call off the marriage. (off Data's look) She's just getting cold feet.
 DATA / Cold feet... jitters... a nervous reaction to an impending event of great importance.
 GEORDI / Right. Don't worry, everything'll be fine. She'll change her mind again.
 DATA / (surprised) She will?
 GEORDI / Absolutely.
 DATA / Then you believe the wedding will still proceed?
 GEORDI / Trust me, they'll get married... so you better find a gift.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) I find Lieutenant Worf to be what is called a kindred spirit. We were both orphans and were both rescued by Starfleet officers. In many ways, we are both still outsiders in Human society. I do not fully understand why, but I find it... comforting to think that I am not alone in that regard.
 DATA / (to Worf) Are you here to find a wedding gift?
 WORF / Yes.
 DATA / I would appreciate your help in selecting an appropriate item.
 WORF / (a little proudly) Of course. I have attended human weddings before.
 DATA / This is a traditional gift?
 WORF / My adoptive parents often give these... things at family weddings. A human custom.
 DATA / It was my understanding that the item selected should reflect the personality of whoever is giving the gift. (looks at screen) This does not remind me of you.
 DATA / Have you ever been an actual participant in a human wedding?
 WORF / (with distaste) No.
 DATA / You would not consider it to be an honor?
 WORF / An honor, perhaps. But human bonding rituals involve a great deal of talking, dancing, and crying.
 DATA / (concerned) Dancing...
 BEVERLY is talking to a NURSE. They are in the / 'birthing area' of Sickbay, a semi-private area where a very PREGNANT WOMAN is lying on one of the biobeds, while her HUSBAND (non-Starfleet) sits next to her. Data's V.O. can be heard over the following...
 BEVERLY / Continue to monitor the contractions. I'd say she still has a couple hours to go.
 BEVERLY / (to woman) You're going to be just fine.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) I am rarely in need of Doctor Beverly Crusher's professional services as my biomechanical maintenance program (tech) is self-sufficient. But I often observe as she practices medicine on others and have learned a great deal about the human condition from her.
 DATA / Doctor, may I ask a favor of you?
 BEVERLY / Of course.
 DATA / Will you teach me how to dance?
 BEVERLY / What?
 DATA / I would like to learn how to dance.
 BEVERLY / Why me?
 DATA / It is in your service record. 'Awarded first prize in tap and jazz competition, Saint Louis Academy---
 BEVERLY / (trying to quiet him) Okay, okay.
 DATA / (puzzled) Have I said something to upset you?
 BEVERLY / It's just... that was a long time ago. (off his look) I'd rather not be known as... as the dancing doctor. Again.
 DATA / Then your answer is no?
 BEVERLY / (quietly) All right. But let's keep this between us.
 DATA / Of course, Doctor.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Data, please report to the Bridge.
 DATA / (hits communicator) Acknowledged.
 PICARD / Mister Data... I need a tactical projection of possible future Romulan deployments along the Neutral Zone. Access all Federation records on the subject and then report to my Ready Room.
 DATA / That is a very general request, Captain. Is there a more specific area you wish me to study?
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Set course one-three-zero mark two-four-six. Warp seven.
 RIKER / That course will take us very close to the Neutral Zone, Captain.
 PICARD / I'm aware of that. Proceed.
 RIKER / Lay in the course.
 DATA (V.O.) / It is fortunate that I am able to perform my duties without emotional distractions. If that were not the case, a sudden course correction toward the Neutral Zone would make me very... nervous.
 DATA (V.O.) / Personal Log: Supplemental. Commander Maddox, there are still many dynamics of social interaction which I do not understand.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing over above action) The belief among humans that a captain must remain distant from his crew is puzzling. Captain Picard and I have worked together closely for over three years...
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing over above action) ... and yet I cannot truthfully refer to him as my friend. I find that thought to be... disappointing.
 PICARD / Based on your analysis, what is the current Romulan strategy behind the deployment of their ships in this sector?
 DATA / Their ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontation designed to test Federation defenses along the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Do you predict any change in the near future?
 DATA / I project a ninety percent probability that they will continue to pursue this policy.
 PICARD / Are there any indications of a more conciliatory attitude on their part?
 DATA / (beat) No, sir.
 PICARD / Starfleet Command agrees with you, Ambassador. But I would feel better if you would consent to an escort or...
 PICARD / (reluctant) Thank you, Mister Data.
 DATA / Feline supplement seventy-four.
 DATA / Computer, run fluidic sensor diagnostic.
 DATA / Come in.
 DATA / No. (beat) Would you care to sit down?
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) When one of my friends is distraught, I know that I should attempt to make him more comfortable.
 DATA / May I offer you some refreshment, chief?
 DATA / There is no need to apologize. I was not offended. (beat) Perhaps you would like a pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit upon.
 DATA / Would you care to listen to music? Brahms? Aurelia? Mexler?
 DATA / Would Counselor Troi not be a more appropriate choice to speak with Keiko?
 DATA / I do not know what to say to her.
 DATA / Perhaps she has not fully analyzed her decision.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) Commander Maddox, I noted that Keiko was quite calm and rational when she informed me of her decision this morning.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) Therefore, I can predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of the situation based on the available facts.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing over above action) It is fortunate that she has not let emotional considerations cloud her judgement. It should make my task much simpler.
 DATA / Am I disturbing you?
 DATA / There is a high likelihood that your decision to cancel the wedding was an error.
 DATA / I believe you made an incorrect analysis of the facts at hand.
 DATA / You do not seem happy.
 DATA / Your decision was based on the assumption that cancelling the wedding would bring you happiness. That has proved to be incorrect.
 DATA / Since your action did not produce the desired results, the most advisable solution is to re-examine the decision-making process and look for errors.
 DATA / That fact is not in dispute. However, you may have acted with undue haste... and in doing so, you have unintentionally hurt Chief O'Brien's feelings.
 DATA / I am your friend.
 DATA / If I have offended---
 DATA (V.O.) / It is clear that I need guidance to resolve this situation. Counselor Troi's advice should be useful.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing over above action) In many ways, she is the friend that I understand the least. Her life and her duties are predicated on her understanding and perception of emotions. Since I have none, no doubt she finds me as much of a mystery as I find her.
 DATA / Chief O'Brien talks to me... Keiko talks to you... why do they not talk to each other?
 TROI / (smiles) That's a good question, Data. I wish I had a good answer for you. Perhaps when they're ready, they will.
 DATA / Many aspects of this situation are puzzling. I have been studying relevant texts on the subject of marriage, but I have not found a suitable guide.
 TROI / A suitable guide for what?
 DATA / In an effort to be helpful, I am trying to calculate the variables involved in a successful marriage.
 TROI / Good luck.
 DATA / There are many different opinions. On Galvin Five, a marriage is considered successful only if children are produced within a year of the wedding. Andorian marriages require groups of four people unless two---
 TROI / Data... would you like my advice on how to help them? (off his nod) Don't. This is something they need to work out for themselves now.
 DATA / But I am their friend. Should I not stand with them in a time of difficulty?
 TROI / There are many ways of helping a friend... sometimes the best way is to leave them alone.
 DATA / Do you believe marriage to be the right decision for them?
 TROI / I don't know. They are very much in love, but sometimes that isn't enough. Marriage is an agreement to share who you are with someone else... to spend your lives together... to grow old together.
 DATA / (concerned) 'To grow old together?' Is that an integral component of marriage?
 TROI / (cautious) Why do you ask?
 DATA / Although I am an android, I have not excluded the possibility that I too may someday marry.
 TROI / There's nothing wrong with that.
 DATA / I believe I have much to offer a potential mate, however we cannot grow old together, Counselor, because I will not grow old.
 TROI / (smiles) You do have a lot to offer, Data...
 DATA / (hits communicator) Acknowledged.
 DATA / That is correct, Ambassador.
 DATA / (processes for a second) That code is valid.
 DATA / May I ask what is the purpose for this request?
 DATA / I have the same safeguards as the ship's computer. Therefore, I must report any inquiry regarding restricted information to the Captain along with a report stating the nature and purpose of the inquiry.
 DATA / Your reaction suggests that you do not wish the Captain to be informed of your inquiry.
 DATA (V.O.) / Commander Maddox, I have often wished for the sense that humans call intuition or instinct. Since Vulcans do not lie, I must accept the Ambassador's explanation... but I still wish I could have a... gut feeling to back up this conclusion.
 BEVERLY / Hi. (re: the room) Whatta ya think? It's a recreation of the studio where I took my first dance lesson.
 DATA / It appears to be quite suitable, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / All right, then. Let's start with something real simple.
 BEVERLY / Go ahead, try it.
 BEVERLY / (surprised) Good! Now try this...
 BEVERLY / Wait a minute... (Data stops) Try it again, but watch my arms...
 BEVERLY / (shocked at his skill) And... you say you're never done this... ?!
 DATA / That is correct. Perhaps it would be beneficial to show me the final lesson.
 BEVERLY / Okay...
 BEVERLY / That was the easiest lesson I've ever given.
 DATA / Then I have succeeded in learning how to dance?
 BEVERLY / You seem to have... picked up the basics.
 DATA / Thank you, Doctor. I am now ready to dance at the wedding.
 BEVERLY / (reacts) Wedding?
 DATA / Keiko's wedding.
 BEVERLY / But you never... you didn't say it was for the wedding.
 DATA / Is that important?
 BEVERLY / Well... yes. They don't do a lot of tap dancing at weddings...
 DATA / Why not?
 BEVERLY / Because... well... actually I'm not exactly sure, Data. But we'd better try a style of dancing they will do at the wedding... Computer, run "Blue Moon".
 BEVERLY / Compared to what we were just doing, it's very simple. Just follow me. One, two, three, four---
 BEVERLY / No, no... you're trying to---Ow! Move more slowly... that's it... no, now you're--Ow! Stop music.
 DATA / I am sorry.
 BEVERLY / I don't get it... you picked up tap dancing so quickly...
 DATA / I cannot reproduce your performance if I cannot see your feet.
 BEVERLY / (now she understands) You need something to copy. You can't just... dance?
 DATA / No, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / All right... this time, watch my feet. Computer, start music. (the music starts) Don't try to imitate me. You have to lead.
 DATA / Lead where?
 BEVERLY / Indicate to your partner where you're going to step.
 DATA / How is this accomplished... ?
 BEVERLY / Watch me, I'll lead... (they switch arms) Notice I don't repeat the same pattern over and over... I improvise... Good... Now you lead... (they switch positions again) Look up... into my eyes... Good... You're holding me too tight, Data...
 DATA / This is a very complex set of variables to coordinate.
 BEVERLY / You're doing fine... now smile, like you're enjoying yourself...
 BEVERLY / (wincing, hits communicator) Is it Lieutenant Juarez?
 BEVERLY / I'm on my way. (to Data) Why don't you try it with an... artificial partner for a little while? Don't be afraid to experiment.
 DATA / I will. Thank you, Doctor.
 DATA / Computer, create dance partner, female.
 DATA / Begin music.
 RIKER / ... he still won't talk... so they put the Count's head on the chopping block... 'one more chance' says the Queen. 'No' says the Count. The headsman swings his axe and just as the blade falls, the Count says 'Wait, wait, I'll talk!' but it was too late. And the moral to the story is don't hatchet your counts before they chicken.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over the above) Commander Riker's easy-going manner and sense of humor is fascinating. It is one reason why he is so popular among the crew. I believe it may also be partly responsible for his success in matters of love. There may be a possible correlation between humor and sex... the need for more research is indicated.
 DATA / Commander, we have reached the designated coordinates.
 RIKER / All stop. (to com) Captain Picard to the Bridge.
 PICARD / Hold position. Long range scan.
 DATA / I have detected a ship in the Neutral Zone, Captain. Configuration... Romulan Warbird.
 PICARD / Yellow Alert.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, hail the Warbird.
 WORF / (works console) Aye, sir. (beat) They are responding... text only Captain. (reads message) We are to proceed to the agreed coordinates.
 PICARD / Set course zero three seven mark zero zero five, warp four. Take us into the Neutral Zone, Ensign.
 WORF / (reading console) Captain, the Warbird is holding position. In three minutes we will be within phaser range.
 PICARD / Red Alert.
 PICARD / My crew knows their duty, Ambassador. They will take no provocative action... without my order.
 RIKER / (glances at his terminal) Slow to half impulse.
 WORF / (works console) Open.
 PICARD / As are yours, Admiral.
 PICARD / (quiet) Ambassador, I must once again urge you to reconsider. The Enterprise can accommodate a Romulan delegation without sacrificing security or---
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge to Transporter Room Three.
 PICARD / Prepare to beam Ambassador T'Pel to the Romulan ship.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Maintain a lock on her signal once she's aboard their vessel. At the first sign of trouble I want to be able to bring her back.
 WORF / Understood.
 WORF / Transporter activated...
 WORF / Captain---!
 WORF / Boosting power to autosequencers.
 DATA / Engaging computer override.
 RIKER / (to com, urgent) O'Brien what's happening down there?
 DATA (V.O.) / (over the above) Personal Log: Supplemental. The risks aboard a starship are accepted by all who serve, but I have never failed to observe a deep emotional response to the loss of a comrade. It is at times like this that I greatly miss the ability to share human feelings.
 DATA / (to Picard) Captain, there is no prior record of this type of accident occurring on a starship. Back-up systems and safeguards are designed to prevent just such an occurrence.
 GEORDI / I can't find any system flaws in the unit, sir. All the Engineering status reports were normal. None of the backups were activated and the autosequencers all functioned normally.
 PICARD / Any prior malfunctions with this Transporter unit?
 RIKER / Could there have been some kind of interference from the Romulans?
 PICARD / (to Geordi) I want that unit pulled and its systems checked again. I also want a level one diagnostic performed on all Transporters.
 GEORDI / Aye, Captain.
 BEVERLY / Her molecular structure dissipated instantly once the pattern was lost. There were a few organic compounds left on the pad, but there's not enough material for an autopsy.
 PICARD / To die in a Transporter accident... Hardly a fitting end for one of the Federation's most honored diplomats.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain. Admiral Mendak wishes to speak with you.
 PICARD / There's been... an accident. Ambassador T'Pel... was killed in a Transporter malfunction.
 PICARD / We're investigating that right now. I'm sure that---
 PICARD / Admiral, I can assure you that the Federation places the highest priority on this mission and its goal.
 PICARD / You're mistaken. I am ready and willing to discuss the establishment of full diplomatic relations under the same terms as Ambassador T'Pel.
 PICARD / Set course for Federation territory, warp two.
 PICARD / (continuing) Engage. (to Data) Mister Data, take charge of the investigation. Study computer logs, sensor information... everything. I refuse to believe this was a simple malfunction.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA (V.O.) / Captain Picard was the person who first interested me in the works of Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) I have subsequently become a great admirer of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his ability to solve mysteries by careful examination of the available evidence.
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) I have found Holmes' methodology of deductive reasoning to be quite useful in performing my duties. One of his adages is that once you have eliminated the impossible...
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) ... whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid I can't give you another lesson right now, Data.
 DATA / That is not my purpose. I wish to examine the remains of Ambassador T'Pel found on the Transporter pad.
 BEVERLY / I'm working on my report right now.
 DATA / Have you compared the genetic code with the Ambassador's last recorded Transporter ID trace?
 BEVERLY / No... that's not part of the standard procedure. Why?
 DATA / (hesitates) I could be pursuing an untamed ornithoid without cause.
 BEVERLY / A wild goose chase?
 BEVERLY / Okay... let's see what happens... Computer, access Transporter ID trace of Ambassador T'Pel.
 BEVERLY / All right... there's the genetic record of the Ambassador when she beamed aboard the Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / Now, the breakdown of the organic material found on the Transporter pad should be identical. (beat as she reads screen) Mitochondrial structure fits all general parameters... no change in the nucleotide bases...
 BEVERLY / (frowns) There's a slight discrepancy in the base pair sequence.
 BEVERLY / (to Data) Chemically, these are identical... however, the organic sample from the Transporter is showing numerous single-bit errors... like replicated material.
 DATA / Can you postulate an explanation for the discrepancy?
 BEVERLY / I'd say the DNA was either mutated by the Transporter during the rematerialization process...
 DATA / (he expected this) A supposition not supported by the Transporter records.
 BEVERLY / Or these aren't the remains of the Ambassador.
 DATA / (to Picard) The only abnormality found during my investigation was a temporary increase in the matter to energy signal ratio. This fluctuation was well within operating parameters and would normally not invite further consideration. However, due to the circumstances, I decided to investigate the possibility that a second Transporter signal had caused the fluctuation. Although this was highly improbable, it was the only remaining theory.
 RIKER / A second transporter signal? From where?
 DATA / From the Devoras.
 GEORDI / Romulan transporters operate on similar subspace frequencies to our own. With minor adjustments they could be made to simulate our own transporter carrier wave.
 PICARD / So they beamed the Ambassador off our own pad.
 DATA / While simultaneously a small amount of genetically similar material was left in the Ambassador's place.
 RIKER / To make us believe she died as a result of the 'malfunction.'
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (hits communicator) Mister Worf, where is the Devoras?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / The ship is still in the Neutral Zone... (BEGIN DATA V.O.) ... on course zero seven nine mark one two five... speed warp two.
 RIKER / Heading for home.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) The safest and most logical decision in this situation is to contact Starfleet and await further instructions. However, based on past experience, I project only a seventeen percent chance Captain Picard will choose that alternative.
 PICARD / Red Alert. All hands stand to battlestations.
 PICARD / Lay in an intercept course to the Romulan ship.
 RIKER / Shields up, load all torpedo bays, stand-by phasers.
 DATA / Course laid in, Captain.
 PICARD / Warp factor eight. Engage.
 PICARD / Open a channel to the Devoras.
 WORF / Aye, sir. (works console) No response.
 DATA / The Devoras is dropping out of warp... their weapon systems are powering up.
 PICARD / Go to impulse power.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 WORF / Message coming in, sir.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / (firm) Admiral Mendak, you are holding our Ambassador captive.
 PICARD / We know about the Transporter 'malfunction' and that you are holding Ambassador T'Pel.
 WORF / Captain, Romulan Warbird decloaking to starboard!
 PICARD / It is my responsibility to protect the lives of Federation citizens. I will not permit this abduction to succeed..
 PICARD / (final) I am prepared to take whatever action is necessary to obtain the Ambassador's return.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over above action) In poker, there is a moment when a player must decide if an opponent is being deceptive or actually holds a winning hand. This decision is based not only on the odds, but also on an appraisal of the man. Is he bluffing or does he have the cards?
 RIKER / T'Pel?
 PICARD / A spy.
 WORF / Sir, long-range scanners show three more Romulan ships moving into this sector.
 RIKER / (quiet) Some days you get the bear, some days the bear gets you.
 PICARD / Reverse course... take us back to Federation territory, warp six. Engage.
 DATA (V.O.) / Captain Picard once drew an analogy between life and a chess game... he said that the loss of a single piece does not concede the game itself.
 DATA (V.O.) / The Captain has also said that out of the ashes of defeat rise the victorious dreams of men. I find that to be a worthy philosophy and I have incorporated it into my programming.
 DATA / Keiko, I need your help. (off her surprised look) I have offended you and need to find a way to rectify my mistake. I am not sure what to do.
 DATA / I should not have interfered. It would be best if I apologized.
 DATA / But...
 DATA / (to Keiko, as she leaves) I am not nervous. (beat, to himself) I am just... confused.
 PICARD / Since the time of the first wooden sailing ships, all captains have enjoyed the happy privilege of joining two people in the bonds of matrimony. And so now it is my honor to unite you Keiko Ishikawa, and you Miles Edward O'Brien together in marriage here in the sight of your friends and family.
 DATA (V.O.) / (over part of the above) There are still many human emotions I do not fully comprehend... anger, hatred, revenge...
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) But I am not mystified by the desire to be loved...
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) ... the need for friendship... these are things I do understand.
 DATA / (quietly) I was looking for Doctor Crusher. I wished to thank her for my...
 PICARD / (softly) She just left.
 DATA / The Juarez child?
 PICARD / (nods) A boy. (beat) At the same time we were facing destruction... this small miracle was taking place.
 PICARD / (softly) Welcome aboard.
 WORF / (stands) All systems normal, sir. We are on course for Adelphous Four. Engineering is realigning the main deflector dish, Sickbay reports Lieutenant Umbato broke two ribs during a Holodeck exercise, and sensors continue to gather long range information on the Murasaki Quasar.
 DATA / Very well. I have the Bridge.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 DATA / (to com) Begin night watch.
 DATA (V.O.) / If being human is not simply a matter of being born flesh and blood... if it is instead a way of thinking, acting... and feeling... then I am hopeful that one day I will discover my own humanity. Until then Commander Maddox, I will continue... learning, changing, growing... and trying to become more than what I am.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log: Stardate 44429.6. We are on a mapping survey near the Cardassian sector. It has been nearly a year since a peace treaty ended the long conflict between the Federation and Cardassia.
 PICARD, WORF, DATA, RIKER, TROI, SUPERNUMERARIES as / needed.
 DATA / Captain, we are nearing the periphery of Sector twenty-one-five-oh-three.
 PICARD / Be on the lookout for a Cardassian patrol vessel, Mister Worf. They should be hailing us soon.
 RIKER / Even with a treaty, they're skittish about protecting their borders.
 PICARD / Last time I was in this sector, I was on the Stargazer, running at warp speed ahead of a Cardassian warship.
 TROI / (amused) Running, Captain? You? That's hard to believe...
 PICARD / Believe it. I'd been sent to make preliminary overtures to a truce... I lowered my shields as a gesture of good will. But the Cardassians weren't impressed. They took out most of my weapons and damaged the impulse engines before I could regroup and run.
 WORF / The Cardassians have no honor. I do not trust them.
 TROI / They're our allies now, Worf. We have to trust them.
 WORF / Trust is earned, not given away.
 PICARD / Well, I hope their scout vessel makes contact soon. It's not a good idea to stay too long on a Cardassian border without making your intentions known.
 WORF / Cardassian ship preparing to fire again, sir!
 PICARD / Increase power to forward shields!
 PICARD / Hail them again, Mister Worf.
 RIKER / What is he doing? Damage report!
 WORF / Minor damage to secondary hull before we put our shields up, sir. No casualties, structural integrity intact.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Engineering to Bridge... starboard power coupling is down...
 PICARD / Evasive action -- Delta Sequence. Mister Worf, ready phasers.
 DATA / Delta Evasion Plan initiated...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, limit targets to engines and shields...
 WORF / Aye sir... ready...
 PICARD / Fire.
 DATA / Direct hit, sir. Moderate damage to their aft shield generators...
 PICARD / Continue phaser fire.
 DATA / Multiple hits. Power failure in forward shields...
 WORF / Cardassian ship is standing down, sir.
 PICARD / Let's see if they'll answer our hail now, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Frequency open, sir.
 PICARD / (stepping forward) This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / Why have you fired on us?
 PICARD / (perplexed) There is a treaty between our people...
 PICARD / A Federation starship... ?
 PICARD / Gul Macet... the Federation and the Cardassians have struggled too hard for peace to abandon it so easily...
 PICARD / Let me talk to my superiors... find out what's behind this. Give me one hour. The alternative is for us to continue firing at each other. In such a contest, you would be at a disadvantage.
 PICARD / Ben Maxwell... he's one of Starfleet's finest Captains... he must have had provocation.
 PICARD / Then he's still in Cardassian space.
 PICARD / Will the Cardassians cooperate... ?
 PICARD / ... there will be three Cardassians transporting on board... Their Captain, Gul Macet and two of his aides. (beat) My intention is to be as open as possible with them... allow them to share in our search for the Phoenix.
 WORF / Sir, it is necessary to assign them a security detail.
 PICARD / They will be our guests, Mister Worf. I don't want them to feel like prisoners.
 RIKER / I'm inclined to agree with Worf, Captain. I would limit their access while they're on board. They don't need the run of the ship.
 PICARD / I understand your concerns. And I realize... that we have had a long and difficult history with the Cardassians.
 PICARD / However... it is not an exaggeration to say that the difference between peace... and war... is up to us. And the way we treat the Cardassians may make the difference.
 WORF / At least let me post guards at some of the sensitive areas of the ship.
 PICARD / (considers) Very well, we will limit their access. But instruct your people... they are guests.
 PICARD / Counselor, stay close to the crew. Some of them might be uncomfortable with the Cardassians on board. I want no incidents.
 TROI / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Data, is there anyone on board who served previously with Captain Benjamin Maxwell?
 DATA / Accessing... (beat) Chief O'Brien served under his command aboard the Rutledge.
 PICARD / Very well. Mister Riker... Counselor... you will greet our guests in Transporter Room Three. And advise Chief O'Brien that I will be calling on him.
 RIKER / (rising) Yes, sir.
 RIKER / I believe you served under Benjamin Maxwell?
 RIKER / It seems Maxwell has taken it upon himself to destroy a Cardassian space station.
 RIKER / The Captain may want to talk to you about him. (re: Transport) Bring them aboard.
 RIKER / Welcome to the Enterprise. I am First Officer William Riker... this is Counselor Deanna Troi.
 RIKER / Our Transporter Chief, Mister O'Brien.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental: We have entered Cardassian territory, and are proceeding in our quest to locate the Phoenix.
 GEORDI / ... and with long-range sensors, we've been scanning a radius of ten light years. We can effectively scan one sector in a day.
 RIKER / We are scanning Sector twenty-one-five-oh-five now. So far... no sign of the Phoenix.
 RIKER / (right back at him) In fact, we don't have any idea where it is. But the last known co-ordinates seemed like a reasonably good place to start.
 PICARD / (jumping in to keep it smooth) We would welcome any additional intelligence your forces could provide.
 PICARD / Of course you would have concerns, Gul Macet. It is precisely because of that fact that I am including you in every aspect of our effort. (gesturing) You are here, with my staff, hearing reports as I hear them. Nothing is edited... nothing withheld.
 PICARD / Please. Let us continue.
 PICARD / Our Transporter Chief, Mister O'Brien, has served with Benjamin Maxwell. I thought he might provide some insights.
 PICARD / Mister O'Brien... I believe Captain Maxwell lost his family... during a raid on an outpost.
 PICARD / Gentlemen, please. Let us avoid speculation, and confine this discussion to facts. Now, Mister O'Brien --
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Yes, Lieutenant.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain -- long range sensors have located the Phoenix.
 PICARD / Will you join me on the Bridge?
 DATA / We have located the Phoenix in Sector twenty-one-five-oh-five.
 PICARD / Ensign, set a course -- warp six. Mister Worf, send a message by sub-space. Tell them to prepare to rendezvous with us.
 WORF / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Yes?
 PICARD / I'm sure that's true. However, given the circumstances, I'd prefer to make the initial contact myself. As I'm sure you would if the situation were reversed.
 PICARD / At the moment, we have an isolated incident. If I reach him first, diplomatic efforts can still prevail. (beat) But if one of your ships decides to retaliate against the Phoenix... we risk losing control of the situation.
 PICARD / No. I will not.
 PICARD / The pursuing ship is the Phoenix.
 DATA / We believe it to be a Cardassian supply ship.
 PICARD / We... are able to make that determination.
 PICARD / What is important at the moment is that your ship may be in jeopardy. Mister Worf -- any answer to our communications?
 WORF / No, Captain.
 PICARD / Put a repeating message on all sub-space channels. Make it a Priority One communique -- break off pursuit immediately. (turns to Macet) Gul Macet... as you can see, we are doing everything in our power to reach the Phoenix.
 PICARD / Mister Data.
 PICARD / Mister Worf -- has there been any response to our hails?
 WORF / No, sir.
 PICARD / Very well... prepare to relay the transponder code of the Phoenix to the Cardassian warship.
 WORF / Sir -- ?
 PICARD / And then send a message to Captain Maxwell... advise him that we have relayed his location to the Cardassians.
 RIKER / Begging your pardon, Captain... the transponder code will allow them to track all our ships.
 PICARD / I'm aware of that. Mister Worf -- any response from the Phoenix?
 WORF / No, Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Data, any change in their their course?
 DATA / Nossir. The Phoenix is continuing on its bearing toward the supply ship.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... relay the prefix codes of the Phoenix to the Cardassian warship.
 WORF / (stunned) Sir, they'll be able to dismantle its shields! The Phoenix won't have a chance.
 PICARD / I cannot allow Maxwell to ambush that supply ship. Mister Worf -- now.
 WORF / Yes, Captain.
 DATA / Sir, the Cardassian warship is moving on the Phoenix.
 PICARD / Mister Data, overlay weapon ranges of the two ships...
 DATA / The warship is three hundred thousand kilometers from the Phoenix. It is opening fire. The Phoenix has taken a direct hit.
 DATA / The Phoenix is beginning evasive maneuvers. (beat) It has positioned itself outside the weapons range of the opposing ship. (beat) The Phoenix has powered up with both phasers and photon torpedoes. (beat) The Phoenix is firing photon torpedoes.
 PICARD / (to Macet) Does the supply ship carry any weapons?
 DATA / Sir...
 PICARD / Mister Data... estimated time until we intercept the Phoenix.
 DATA / At our present speed of warp four, sixteen hours, forty-four minutes.
 PICARD / Ensign, increase to warp nine.
 PICARD / I wanted to... chat with you.
 PICARD / Ben Maxwell must be quite a man.
 PICARD / Then... from your knowledge of the man... what has gone wrong?
 PICARD / How did he take it... when his family was killed?
 PICARD / I see...
 PICARD / You don't care for the Cardassians...
 PICARD / Within the last hour... Benjamin Maxwell has sent over six hundred of them to their deaths.
 PICARD / I think... when one has been angry for a very long time... one gets used to it. Then it becomes comfortable... like old leather. (beat) And finally, it is so familiar that one can hardly remember feeling any other way. (beat) But in the long run, we are the ones who are damaged by that kind of anger. We are. Not them.
 WORF / Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, you may release the man.
 WORF / (letting go) He was found at a computer station on Deck thirty-five, attempting to access information on our weapon systems.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, please accompany him.
 WORF / Gladly.
 PICARD / You have the Bridge, Number One.
 PICARD / (conciliatory) You may take whatever action against him you feel is appropriate. I consider the matter closed.
 PICARD / If there is to be a lasting peace, Gul Macet, neither you nor I must allow any one man to undermine our efforts...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain.
 PICARD / Picard here.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / We have located the Phoenix, Sir. We will intercept in twenty-two minutes.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44431.7. We have established communication with Captain Maxwell, and he has agreed to come on board.
 RIKER / Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander Riker, First Officer.
 RIKER / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Captain... Gul Macet. He and his aides are guests on the ship.
 RIKER / Captain Picard is waiting in his Ready Room. This way.
 RIKER / Captain Picard... Captain Benjamin Maxwell.
 PICARD / Captain...
 PICARD / Sit down, please. (to Riker) That will be all, Commander.
 PICARD / The thought has occurred.
 PICARD / I know of nothing out here that could justify what you've done.
 PICARD / How do you know this?
 PICARD / From whom? Where is your documentation?
 PICARD / In other words, you have no documentation...
 PICARD / Whatever circumstances you believed you encountered, why didn't you notify Starfleet?
 PICARD / You weren't under fire.
 PICARD / Whose lives?
 PICARD / Why?
 PICARD / You have killed nearly seven hundred people... taken us to the brink of war...
 PICARD / And so you alone simply decided to dispose of the treaty...
 PICARD / 'What had to be done'? For whom, Maxwell? (beat) Why does a man with your long, brilliant service suddenly abandon the fundamental principles that he has believed in, even fought for, all his life... ? I'll tell you what I believe... it was because of what they did to your wife... and your children...
 PICARD / ... to avenge their deaths.
 PICARD / I'll accept the judgement of history.
 PICARD / What the Cardassians have or haven't done is irrelevant...
 PICARD / We are not going after any more Cardassian ships, Captain Maxwell... you are going to return to your bridge and set a course for Starbase Two-one-one... the Phoenix and the Enterprise will return to Federation space together. I will permit you the dignity of retaining your command during our voyage. My only alternative would be to put you in our brig, while we tow your ship back to starbase in disgrace.
 PICARD / You understand your orders?
 PICARD / Mister Worf, report to my Ready Room. Our guest is departing.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental: With the Phoenix in close formation, we are proceeding directly to Starbase Two-one-one.
 PICARD / Mister Data, how long before we clear Cardassian space?
 DATA / At our present speed, three hours and twenty minutes.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, send a message to Admiral Haden at Starfleet. Inform him of our projected time of arrival.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Captain... the Phoenix is changing course.
 PICARD / (to Conn) Ensign, change course to pursue. Mister Worf, hail Captain Maxwell.
 WORF / No response, sir.
 RIKER / Data, project his new course.
 DATA / Sir, the Phoenix is heading directly for a Cardassian vessel... point-one-two light years from our location.
 PICARD / Continue your hail, Lieutenant, Priority One message. (to Macet) Do you know what that vessel might be?
 WORF / The Phoenix still does not respond.
 PICARD / Ensign, warp eight. Overtake him.
 DATA / Sir, the Phoenix has accelerated to warp nine. We will not be able to reach him before he intercepts the Cardassian ship.
 PICARD / Warp nine, Ensign. Mister Worf, arm phasers... continue hails...
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Captain, Chief O'Brien was Maxwell's Tactical officer...
 PICARD / Get him up here.
 DATA / Sir, the Phoenix has dropped out of warp. They have reached the Cardassian vessel.
 RIKER / Slow to impulse.
 WORF / Vessels are in visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / (to Data) Has the Phoenix activated its weapon systems?
 DATA / Negative, sir. Phaser banks are not armed...
 RIKER / What about the Cardassians?
 DATA / (checking) Our sensors are unable to determine status of the Cardassian defensive systems... Their ship is running with a high-powered subspace field.
 PICARD / Mister O'Brien... your former Commander is about to place me in the unenviable position of having to fire upon another Federation ship. I will need to draw upon your knowledge of the man... how he thinks... what he is capable of doing...
 WORF / Sir, Captain Maxwell is hailing us.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Captain Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order...
 PICARD / The Cardassian ship will not be boarded. You will transport yourself aboard the Enterprise...
 PICARD / And I will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you from taking that action, Captain.
 DATA / Captain, the Phoenix is transferring power to its shields...
 WORF / They're arming phasers... loading forward torpedo bays...
 PICARD / Red alert. It appears you are correct, Mister O'Brien.
 PICARD / Ready phasers... load torpedoes...
 WORF / Phasers ready... loading forward and aft torpedo bays...
 RIKER / He'll never drop his shields to let you transport on board.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 GEORDI / I'm not so sure it's going to work this time. Can you get an accurate enough fix on his shield modulation to get through?
 GEORDI / So you'll sync up the beam...
 GEORDI / But if there's any phase error... you could materialize outside the ship... we'd never have a chance to correct.
 GEORDI / And I guess we could increase the pattern buffer cycle to give us a little more margin for error...
 GEORDI / Okay, Chief -- let's do it.
 GEORDI / Stand by... five seconds... here we go... two... one...
 GEORDI / Good luck, Chief.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental: Captain Maxwell has turned his ship over to his First Officer and transported aboard the Enterprise. I have confined him to quarters for the return voyage.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Well done. That'll be all.
 PICARD / The loyalty you would so quickly dismiss does not come easily to my people, Gul Macet. You have much to learn about us. Benjamin Maxwell earned the loyalty of those who served with him. In war, he was twice honored with the Federation's highest citation for his courage and valor. And if he could not find a role for himself in peace, we can pity him, but we shall not dismiss him.
 PICARD / Oh, one more thing, Macet. Maxwell was right. Those ships weren't carrying scientific equipment, were they?
 PICARD / A 'research' station within arm's reach of three Federation sectors... ? Cargo ships running with high energy subspace fields that jam sensors?
 PICARD / I was here to protect the peace, a peace I firmly believe is in the interests of both our peoples. But if I had attempted to board that ship... I am quite certain that you and I would not be sitting here now. And that ships on both sides would be arming for war.
 PICARD / (interrupting) Take a message to your leaders, Gul Macet. We know. We'll be watching. We'll be ready.
 DATA_SCROOGE / I don't.
 DATA_SCROOGE / I don't know.
 DATA_SCROOGE / Because a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are. Humbug, I tell you humbug!
 PICARD / Freeze program.
 PICARD / Very nicely done, Data... your performance skills really are improving...
 DATA / I have taken your advice, Captain. This time I have not imitated another actor's rendition. It was my own interpretation...
 PICARD / And a very interesting one... you should be congratulated...
 DATA / Your courtesy is appreciated. But I am aware that I do not effectively convey the fear called for in this scene.
 PICARD / Well, you've never known fear. But as an acute observer of behavior, you certainly should be able to approximate...
 DATA / (interrupting) Sir... That would not be an appropriate basis for an effective performance. Not by the standards set by my mentors.
 PICARD / Your mentors... ?
 DATA / Yessir. I have studied the philosophies of virtually every known acting master, but I find myself particularly attracted to Stanislavsky, Adler, Garnav... proponents of a performance technique known as "The Method."
 PICARD / "Method acting?" Yes, I'm vaguely familiar with it... why would you choose such an old-fashioned approach...
 DATA / Perhaps because the technique requires an actor to seek his own emotional awareness to understand the character he plays...
 PICARD / But that would seem an impossible task for you, Data.
 DATA / I have modified the method for my own use, sir. Since I have no emotional awareness to create a performance, I am attempting to use performance to create an emotional awareness. I believe if I can learn to duplicate the fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, then I will be one step closer to being truly human.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard, please report to the Bridge...
 PICARD / On my way, Number One... (to Data) Data, the moment you decided to stop imitating other actors and to create your own interpretation... you were already one step closer to being truly human.
 WORF, RIKER at their positions. As Picard ENTERS... / 
 RIKER / We've received an emergency transmission from the Ventax Two science station...
 PICARD / Nature of the emergency...
 RIKER / Uncertain... the signal was interrupted by...
 WORF / (interrupting, adjusting his controls) Contact reestablished with Ventax Two, Commander.
 RIKER / On screen.
 The viewscreen shifts from the starfield to the image of a wispy-haired, nervous and extremely harried man, DR. HOWARD CLARK. He is standing in a small, / equipment-filled room; behind him are several TECHNICIANS, who are racing about frantically, gathering books, ledgers and other effects. The picture on the screen is filled periodically with bursts of static; every now and then the screen goes blank and then flickers back to life.
 PICARD / (continuing) I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Please identify yourself.
 DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN) / I am Doctor Howard Clark, director of the science station here on Ventax Two. Thank you for responding.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, can you improve our reception?
 WORF / The trouble is at the transmission source, sir.
 PICARD / Doctor Clark, we can barely maintain communication with you. Can you boost the level of your power source?
 DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN) / I'm afraid not, Captain. It's under attack.
 PICARD / Under attack?
 DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN) / There is a mob outside, trying to break into the station. The planet is in chaos. Looting. Fires...
 PICARD / Ensign, set a new course for Ventax Two...
 PICARD / Doctor Clark, what has caused the riots... ?
 DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN) / Mass hysteria... it's impossible to explain... these people are all convinced their world is coming to an end... tomorrow. Please, we must have your immediate...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44474.5. We have reached Ventax Two and are attempting to contact the Federation science station, which at last report was under siege by a mob.
 WORF / They are transmitting again.
 PICARD / On screen, before we lose contact.
 DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN) / Enterprise, Enterprise! Do you read me? Emergency! We need help!
 PICARD / Doctor Clark, this is Captain Picard. We are ready to beam you and your staff on board the...
 DR. CLARK (O.C.) / (crying out) They're in! They're in!
 PICARD / Transporter Room Three! Lock onto the station team and beam them aboard.
 PICARD / Beam up Doctor Clark by himself... Mister Worf, escort him to my ready room...
 WORF / (exiting) Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Number One, try to make some sense of this "mess."
 DR. CLARK / The people of Ventax Two live in an agrarian society. At least, they do now.
 PICARD / What do you mean, "now?"
 DR. CLARK / It's an interesting anthropological question. One we were studying before the... trouble began. In their distant past the Ventaxian culture had achieved an extremely advanced scientific level, but a millennium ago they turned their backs on technology.
 PICARD / Be careful, it's hot...
 PICARD / So they reverted to a simpler existence... ?
 DR. CLARK / And have remained that way for centuries. First contact was made by a Klingon expedition seventy years ago. Since then, new technology has been available to the Ventaxians. They simply have no interest in it. There have been virtually no social problems to be found on this planet... in fact, I would have described their society as idyllic until...
 PICARD / Until what, doctor?
 DR. CLARK / It's hard to believe... (beat) Several years ago, Acost Jared, the Ventaxian head of state, began to grow increasingly obsessed with the legend of "Ardra." With each passing day, he grew more anxious, until he talked about little else. "Ardra is coming back. Ardra will be here soon. We must all leave before Ardra returns."
 PICARD / And who is Ardra?
 DR. CLARK / (shakes his head in disbelief) For all intents and purposes... (beat, sighs) ... the devil. (off Picard's look) Captain, these people actually believe they've sold their souls to the devil.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Have you located the science team, Number One?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Evidently they're being held hostage.
 DR. CLARK / (horrified) Hostage...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (continuing) We have a Ventaxian leader on the viewscreen, name of Acost Jared.
 DR. CLARK / Jared, you must secure the release of my people. I can't believe you would allow this.
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Is there nothing you can do... ?
 DR. CLARK / (to Picard) I've tried to explain to them that there is no evidence, no proof this... this mythic creature ever existed... let alone was about to return to enslave them...
 PICARD / (to Clark) Prophecies?
 DR. CLARK / Ardra's arrival is supposed to be heralded by the "shaking of the cities"... there have been a series of geological tremors on the planet... minor quakes... nothing extraordinary...
 PICARD / But poorly timed...
 PICARD / Visions? Do you mean dreams?
 PICARD / Jared, tell your people if our hostages are released, I am prepared to offer you Federation assistance should this Ardra return.
 TROI / This situation is deteriorating, Captain... people are approaching levels of anxiety that could lead to suicide...
 PICARD / Mister Data, what do we know about this Ardra figure?
 DATA / She is a cornerstone of Ventaxian theology. It seems that Ardra came to Ventax Two and promised one thousand years of peace and prosperity. As her price, she would return and enslave the entire population. In the Ventaxian culture, it is considered bad luck to speak her name out loud. The threat "may Ardra come to your door" is considered a most insulting epithet.
 DR. CLARK / I've often puzzled over this dark legend. It simply doesn't fit in with the rest of Ventaxian mythology... which is sunny and joyous.
 BEVERLY / Perhaps the Ardra myth is a result of their contact with the Klingons.
 GEORDI / (joking) Are you implying Klingons are not sunny and joyous?
 DATA / Ardra predates the Klingon influence on Ventax Two.
 DR. CLARK / There are ancient scrolls concerning Ardra that are stored in the Atheneum vaults... scholars study them... they have been of little public interest until recently...
 PICARD / I think I should meet with Acost Jared... he's still our best hope for the release of the hostages.
 RIKER / (rising) I'll arrange to have him transported aboard...
 PICARD / No... I'm going down to the planet...
 WORF / Sir, you risk being taken as an additional hostage...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Mister O'Brien can stay locked on our communicators and pull us out, if necessary. Mister Worf and Mister Data, you will accompany me... I'm hoping the hostages have not been moved far... if the opportunity presents itself we will move quickly...
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Counselor, I'll want you with me too...
 PICARD / Jared, you must attempt to calm your people. There is no reason for panic.
 PICARD / If the tremors have frightened people... leading to this hysteria over Ardra... allow us to reassure them... (looking to Data)
 DATA / We have scanned the tectonic stress patterns of your planet's crust... there is no evidence that the quakes pose any kind of threat...
 PICARD / If you can at least help us locate our people...
 PICARD / Nonsense... it is only...
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / Who are you?
 PICARD / If your intent is intimidation, madame, you are not succeeding.
 TROI / An entire planet has been terrorized because of the suggestion that you are going to enslave the population...
 DATA / So, you do purport to be the mythic figure Ardra?
 WORF / You are not Fek'lhr.
 PICARD / I have encountered many with a more credible claim to being the devil than you, madame.
 PICARD / You claim you were here a thousand years ago and negotiated a contract... ?
 PICARD / I'd like to see that contract...
 PICARD / (challenging) You won't mind if we don't take your word for it... ? Jared, with Your permission, Mister Data will review the documents... thoroughly.
 PICARD / I only remain here to secure the release of Federation hostages.
 PICARD / Enterprise, advise Doctor Clark that the hostages are being released...
 DR. CLARK'S COM VOICE / This is Clark. You did it, Captain, thank goodness...
 PICARD / (mostly to himself) Goodness... had nothing to do with it. (to Com) Enterprise, three to beam up. Mister Data will remain on the surface... (to Data) I want a complete report on the contents of these scrolls. I will not abandon this planet to that woman. (MORE)
 RIKER / Could she be another refugee from the "Q" continuum?
 BEVERLY / For that matter could she be Q?
 PICARD / Q would never bother with contracts.
 TROI / Or be interested in economic forecasts...
 PICARD / Yes, I noticed that too, Counselor... I had the distinct feeling we were in the presence of a flim-flam artist...
 WORF / But her powers...
 PICARD / Her powers are at best unclear. Think about it, Worf... Transporter technology can make things appear and disappear... the illusion of turning into a Klingon creature could be accomplished by a holographic projection...
 DR. CLARK / And creating a minor tremor could be the result of a low-frequency tractor beam projected against the tectonic plates.
 PICARD / We're capable of recreating any of these events but she dresses them up and delivers them with a dramatic flair...
 BEVERLY / Like a magician.
 PICARD / Exactly.
 TROI / She has an incredibly focused mind... it was virtually impossible to sense any deception... or anything else for that matter...
 GEORDI / The best magicians won't ever let you see what's up their sleeve, Counselor...
 RIKER / There must be a power source she's tapping into to produce all these effects... she's not hiding that up her sleeve...
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Number One, you and Worf will run high-resolution scans of this star system. Look for a ship or a base of operations -- anything large enough to generate that power... Mister La Forge, accompany Doctor Clark back to the science station... see if you can trace the origin of the tremors...
 PICARD / Madame, you will either leave my Bridge or I will remove you by force...
 PICARD / Mister Worf...
 PICARD / Transporter Room Three, lock on to the intruder and transport her to the planet surface...
 PICARD / Ensign, I want shields up until further notice.
 RIKER / We're not impressed by your magic tricks.
 DATA / (to Picard) I have, sir.
 PICARD / Report, Data.
 DATA / The contract does agree to deliver the people of Ventax Two into the personal servitude of Ardra at the end of one thousand years of peace. I have compared the terms to the body of laws which govern the planet. The language of the agreement is correct in every detail.
 DATA / I am an android.
 RIKER / Bonus?
 DATA / I'm afraid one could interpret the contract that way, sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The claim this woman, who calls herself Ardra, has made upon my ship is clearly an empty threat. But she has further inspired my determination to expose her for the fraud she is.
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / You asked to see me, sir?
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Mister Data... A wise man once said there's a sucker born every minute.
 DATA / Barnum, P.T., sir.
 PICARD / I have been examining the dynamics of what used to be called the confidence game... it is really quite fascinating and worthy of your study...
 DATA / Do you believe Ardra is, to use the vernacular, a "con artist", sir... ?
 PICARD / I do, Mister Data... and our job is to find a way to out con the con artist...
 DATA / Sir, if I may point out, the Ventaxians did have a thousand years of peace and tranquility... as Ardra promised...
 PICARD / We can only speculate about what occurred on this planet a thousand years ago, Data... Maybe a Ventaxian leader saw the destruction of his society at hand and conceived this Contract of Ardra to motivate change. Or maybe there really was an Ardra of some sort who was the basis of this myth. (shrugs) Who knows? The point is -- somehow a fundamental theology was created that transformed this society. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / But along with all the benefits of change, came a latent fear that has been passed down through generations...
 DATA / A fear that someday Ardra would return for remuneration.
 PICARD / (nods) And now we are asked to believe she has. (beat) As you may recollect from your performance as Ebenezer Scrooge, Data, "fear" can be a powerful motivator.
 DATA / Indeed, Captain, in the story, the spirits used fear to motivate Scrooge to reform his character.
 PICARD / In the hands of a con artist, fear can be used to motivate obedience, capitulation... to exploit innocent people. That is what I believe is happening here.
 DATA / Is there no possibility at all she is the same Ardra who was here a millenium ago?
 PICARD / I appreciate the fact that we have encountered species that live that long... so I will admit the possibility. But I do not believe this woman is the devil or had the powers to create harmony on this world. These people made massive changes that improved their quality of life... they did this on their own. And I intend to prove it. But I need a loophole... something I can use to challenge the validity of the contract...
 DATA / The language seems carefully chosen to avoid any loopholes, sir...
 PICARD / Check it again... and check every Ventaxian legal precedent for the last thousand years...
 PICARD / (continuing) We'll talk first thing in the morning.
 DATA / Sir, I feel I should point out one possibly incongruous aspect of your Scrooge analogy.
 PICARD / What's that, Data?
 DATA / The spirits that frightened Scrooge turned out to be quite real...
 PICARD / Bah. Humbug.
 PICARD / (to com) Security to Captain's quarters...
 PICARD / Picard to Lieutenant Worf!
 PICARD / I'm growing tired of your games, madame...
 PICARD / I find nothing tantalizing in your garish display... on the contrary, I find it obvious and common...
 TROI_ARDRA / (continuing) ... someone close at hand and yet unattainable... I can do anything for you, Captain. Anything you could ever imagine.
 PICARD / You shallow, pathetic woman.
 PICARD / Easily.
 PICARD / I think not.
 GEORDI / Captain, we weren't expecting you here.
 PICARD / Neither was I.
 GEORDI / (to communicator) La Forge to Enterprise.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / Worf, the Captain's here... You better beam him back on board...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / The Captain! But I have no...
 PICARD / (interrupting) It's all right Worf. Ardra somehow transported me down here. Beam me directly to my quarters.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We've locked on to you. (pause) Transporters are malfunctioning, Captain... some sort of interference... checking...
 PICARD / Just have Mister Data fetch me in a shuttle and have him bring along a uniform...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Did you say a uniform?
 PICARD / I did.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / (beat) Aye, sir...
 PICARD / (frustrated) La Forge and Doctor Clark have made no headway... Worf and Commander Riker have not picked up anything on their scans...
 DATA / Sir, I have found one obscure precedent in Ventaxian law that might be of interest.
 PICARD / Yes?
 DATA / It is noted as Akul K'Ton versus Garv Etes... dated Ventaxian year nine-three-one, A.A.... a dispute was registered in the township of Tau Velor...
 PICARD / Summarize the pertinent points, Data...
 DATA / In effect, it was a contract dispute over services rendered by a Klingon craftsman on the construction of a Ventaxian home. Because the dispute involved an alien culture, the parties decided that arbitration rather than the courts would resolve the issue. Both sides were required to agree on an arbiter and the case was decided in favor of the Ventaxian. It is the only known case involving an alien claimant.
 PICARD / That's exactly what I needed... good work, Data...
 DATA / But, sir, why would Ardra agree to an arbitration in this matter...
 PICARD / I intend to play a confidence game of my own on our new landlord...
 DATA / (reacts) How, sir?
 PICARD / The same way any confidence game is run... by making her believe she is getting something for nothing...
 DATA / (to communicator) Shuttle One to Enterprise... prepare for docking sequence...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Proceed, Shuttle One.
 PICARD / Enterprise. Enterprise. Do you read me? Enterprise, come in.
 DATA / I cannot locate the Enterprise anywhere within one lightyear of the planet.
 PICARD / I don't believe Ardra is capable of transporting the Enterprise a lightyear away. Continue hailing them, Mister Data... repeat on all frequencies...
 GEORDI / Hey, I think we've found something.
 GEORDI / A sudden jump in Z particle readings, right around the time the Enterprise disappeared.
 PICARD / Where did it originate?
 DR. CLARK / It was too brief to pinpoint.
 GEORDI / But it could suggest a hidden power source...
 PICARD / Gentlemen, I need to find that source in order to defeat this woman...
 GEORDI / Well, if you can get her to perform a few more magic tricks like that one we might be able to track it down...
 PICARD / What have you done with my ship, Ardra?
 PICARD / I do not recognize your claim on the Enterprise or on this world for that matter... and in accordance with Ventaxian legal precedent I call for an arbitration...
 PICARD / But there is, madame, for you are a fraud and I intend to prove you could not have affected the changes that took place on this planet...
 PICARD / An illusion. Magicians have been making all sorts of things disappear for ages.
 PICARD / If you are who you say you are, you have nothing to lose in an arbitration.
 PICARD / I am prepared to offer you a further incentive... if you win, I will take you to the ruins of Ligillium...
 PICARD / I do.
 PICARD / And what would that be?
 PICARD / I agree to your terms.
 PICARD / We must agree on an arbiter.
 PICARD / Mister Data? He is a member of my crew.
 DATA / Ardra, before he responds, may I have a word in private with Captain Picard?
 DATA / Sir, I request that you reject me as arbiter.
 PICARD / Why?
 DATA / Ardra is right. If I am chosen, I will perform my duties without bias or sentiment. I cannot guarantee that I will deliver a verdict in your favor.
 PICARD / Data, where else on this planet will I find someone that she cannot intimidate. You are incapable of fear... in this play, you are the perfect choice for the role.
 DATA / Sir, I will have to precisely follow the rules of conduct for a ventaxian jurist.
 PICARD / I understand. You'll make a fine judge.
 PICARD / I accept Data as arbiter.
 PICARD / Objection. The witness has no personal knowledge.
 DATA / Overruled. He is qualified to present an historical view. Answer the question.
 PICARD / Objection. There is no conclusive evidence that this woman visited the planet a thousand years ago...
 PICARD / (dry, to Ardra) That would be quite acceptable.
 DATA / (a beat, considering) Captain Picard, my interpretation of Ventaxian law suggests under these circumstances, this is acceptable... your objection is overruled.
 PICARD / (rising, aghast) But your honor... !
 DATA / Sir, I have ruled. Sit down.
 DATA / (to Ardra) You may proceed.
 PICARD / I must object! The answer would be pure speculation.
 DATA / The question is phrased correctly. Please answer.
 PICARD / Objection!
 PICARD / Your honor, nothing in this testimony proves that Ardra herself had any power to affect the lives of the Ventaxians. My opponent has failed to prove her case and I therefore move that her claim be summarily dismissed.
 DATA / I find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time. The arbitration will continue.
 DATA / It is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate but I see no reason to deny it. Proceed...
 PICARD / Objection.
 DATA / Sustained. The advocate will refrain from expressing personal affections for her opponent.
 PICARD / No, I don't.
 DATA / You are out of order...
 DATA / The advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear.
 DATA / Any further disruption and I will rule you in contempt of court. Is that understood?
 PICARD / (beat) No.
 DR. CLARK / The decay rate of these Z particles makes it almost impossible to trace the source...
 GEORDI / I'm correlating particle trajectories... they're starting to align... wait a minute... (reacting) I have coordinates... thirty-four degrees north, sixty-two degrees east, at an altitude of two hundred ten kilometers.
 DR. CLARK / That would put it in orbit... (checking) ... above the western magnetic pole... running visual scan...
 DR. CLARK (O.C.) / Nothing.
 GEORDI / Uh uh... this time, I don't buy the magic... something's gotta be there... (thinks a beat) Let's run a wavelength stretchout and bring it down into the ultraviolet... check intervals of half an angstrom...
 PICARD / Jared, you have described quite thoroughly the history of your people before and after Ardra's first visit. But I am a little unclear on the change itself. Did Ardra simply snap her fingers, transforming Ventax Two into paradise?
 DATA / Overruled. The opposing advocate's job is to mock your argument.
 DATA / Please answer the question.
 PICARD / Did she personally form the government that has peacefully ruled Ventax Two for a millennium?
 PICARD / I see. So Ardra advised this council...
 PICARD / Well, then she must have destroyed all weapons on the planet...
 PICARD / Which Ardra wrote, I assume.
 PICARD / Well then, let's move on to the environmental gains made on Ventax Two. How were those accomplished...
 PICARD / But Ardra must have at least purified the polluted water and air...
 PICARD / Did Ardra pick up even one piece of trash?
 DATA / To what?
 DATA / Overruled.
 PICARD / Excuse me, but it sounds as though with a great deal of hard work and courage, your ancestors changed this world all by themselves.
 DATA / Sustained. (to Picard) I will draw my own conclusions, if you do not mind.
 PICARD / No further questions.
 DATA / (to Ardra) Rebuttal?
 DATA / Captain Picard, do you have any further evidence to present before I render judgment?
 PICARD / I believe my associate, Mister La Forge is bringing me that very information... If I may have a recess...
 GEORDI / Hi, Data.
 DATA / Hi, Geordi. A one hour recess is granted.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, my reputation as a litigator, not to mention my soul, is in serious jeopardy...
 GEORDI / Well, whatever's been going on over here gave us exactly what we needed...
 PICARD / You've identified her source of power... ?
 GEORDI / (nods) It's a cloaked ship...
 PICARD / She has a Romulan cloaking device?
 GEORDI / More likely, a bad copy of one. We picked it up through a wavelength stretchout...
 PICARD / And the Enterprise?
 GEORDI / Exactly where it's supposed to be. Ardra extended her cloaking shields around it... set up a subspace damping field to interfere with normal operations. I've isolated the frequency spread and penetrated the field.
 PICARD / Can you make contact?
 GEORDI / Already have...
 PICARD / Good... here's what I want to do... but we have less than an hour...
 PICARD / Jared, you are a wise and experienced leader, I would guess you trust your senses...
 PICARD / And all your senses tell you this woman here is the most powerful force on this planet, don't they...
 PICARD / Jared, what would you say if I told you that Ardra has no powers whatsoever?
 PICARD / Ah yes, Ardra's magic. Jared, would you believe me if I told you that I could steal Ardra's powers and perform the same magical acts as she?
 PICARD / That is true. I am not Ardra. And yet, I can create a tremor just as she did.
 DATA / I think he deserves some leeway... overruled... but we have seen enough, Captain.
 PICARD / Agreed. Ardra, if you would do the honors and stop the tremors...
 PICARD / What's the matter?
 PICARD / Well, I don't.
 PICARD / (continuing) Recognize the old bag of tricks? How about this one?
 PICARD / Come back if you can, Ardra. No... ? Fine, allow me...
 PICARD / Impudence?
 PICARD_FEK'LHR / Impudence is pretending to be Fek'lhr of Klingon...
 DATA / Captain, your leeway has run out.
 PICARD / Your honor, I appreciate the court's indulgence... allow me to explain. A team from the Enterprise has taken control of this woman's ship in orbit around Ventax Two. Thank you for your help, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Glad to be of service, sir.
 PICARD / They have been monitoring me on my communicator... and executing a prearranged program on her ship's computer... a fairly ingenious combination of force field projection, holography, and transporter effects. Ardra controls her magic literally by the blink of an eye... centuries old technology -- an implant that allows her eye movements to choose and activate each illusion. (beat) She once told us she is known by many names. At least she was honest about that. Her crew has admitted that she has in fact used twenty-three aliases in this sector alone...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... deceiving innocent people in petty schemes for years.
 PICARD / Ventax Two offered her the greatest opportunity of her nefarious career. She learned about the myth of Ardra, studied it... and expertly played on your fears until your people were ready to virtually surrender to her.
 DATA / With the advocate's withdrawal, the contract is hereby dissolved.
 DATA / This arbitration is adjourned.
 PICARD / No, Jared... as I've tried to tell you, you saved your own lives a long time ago...
 DATA / Congratulations, sir.
 PICARD / (nods) Your honor.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44502.7. Early completion of our mission at Harrakis Five has allowed me to grant extra personal time for many of the crew.
 WORF, dressed in a Klingon robe is leading several / others, including TROI, RIKER and GEORDI in a set of slow exercises, that might be described as Klingon Tai Chi.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Given our recent tight scheduling, this has come as something of a relief.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) Our diplomatic assignment in the Evadne system is a ten day journey past the Ngame Nebula, and I expect it to be uneventful. I personally am using the time to fulfill a promise to a colleague.
 PICARD / She's my cousin.
 PICARD / Sorry, Gloria -- I didn't want to get you involved. She has nothing to do with this, Johnny.
 PICARD / He's lying, Gloria -- don't listen to him.
 PICARD / It's a mystery, Guinan... Who was this man? Who killed him? Where's the money he was talking about? A mystery. Now, we begin the search for clues.
 PICARD / That's fun.
 PICARD / A forty-eight Packard with whitewalls... I couldn't catch the license plate...
 PICARD / (reacts) It's all right. I'll take it, Madeline.
 PICARD / (a little ruffled) What is it?
 DATA is at the helm. / 
 DATA / Please excuse the unusual interruption, Captain. I thought that patching communications through the holodeck program would be less obtrusive.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (a smile) I appreciate the consideration, Commander. What can I do for you?
 DATA / Long range sensors have detected a T-tauri type star within a pocket of the Ngame cloud.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Nothing unusual about that.
 DATA / No, Sir. However, the star's single planet falls within the M-Class range. It is capable of supporting life.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Now that is unusual.
 DATA / Highly, Sir.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes, thank you, Data. Procedures require us to investigate. Recall the bridge crew and set a course.
 PICARD / I'm afraid I have a twenty-fourth century mystery to deal with, Gloria. You're welcome to carry on if you'd like.
 DATA / Sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path. Source unknown.
 WORF / Still picking up energy distortions -- but fading. It seems to be gone.
 PICARD / A wormhole?
 DATA / Very likely. Small and extremely unstable wormholes have been mapped near thirty-nine T-tauri systems in the last one hundred years alone.
 RIKER / Captain, I suggest we move to a safer location. It could reappear at any moment.
 PICARD / Agreed. Ensign, take us --
 DATA / -- Captain!
 DATA (O.S.) / Captain?
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / Careful, Captain. The stun-effect from the wormhole was relatively severe.
 PICARD / Apparently so. How long were we unconscious?
 DATA / Approximately thirty seconds. I have scanned the ship and detected no life-threatening injuries to the crew.
 PICARD / You were not affected?
 DATA / No. My positronic system is immune to the effect. This is the third unstable wormhole I have passed through during my time in Starfleet. The first, on-board the U.S.S. Trieste --
 PICARD / -- Thank you, Data.
 PICARD / (continuing) Well, where the hell are we?
 RIKER / (checking instruments) Point five-four parsecs from our previous position. Almost a day's travel... in just thirty seconds.
 DATA / Sir, I should re-align the ship's clock with Starbase Four-ten's subspace signal to adjust for the time distortion.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Captain, Sickbay here.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / I'm getting scattered reports of minor injuries. What happened?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / The Enterprise just jumped through a wormhole. (MORE)
 PICARD'S COM VOICE (Cont'd) / We were all unconscious for about thirty seconds.
 BEVERLY / Everybody okay up there?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (glancing around) Little or no damage on the Bridge, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Acknowledged. Crusher out.
 PICARD / Ship's status?
 RIKER / Reports coming in now. Nothing serious so far.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Impulse engines and warp drive are unaffected, Captain.
 WORF / Shields and weapons systems are fully functional.
 PICARD / Counselor? Are you alright?
 TROI / Yes... I think so... Excuse me, Captain, but I feel a bit... unfocused... (a deep breath) It will pass.
 PICARD / Not too bad, all things considered.
 RIKER / (agreeing) We're lucky we didn't end up half-way across the galaxy and in the middle of next week.
 DATA / I do not believe that was ever a possibility. The wormhole's small size and extremely short period indicate a relatively local phenomenon.
 RIKER / I didn't mean that literally, Data.
 PICARD / There's still the anomalous M-Class planet we were going to investigate. Do we go back?
 DATA / The unpredictability of the wormhole would make our investigation a hazardous one. A probe from our current position would be more advisable.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 BEVERLY / Nothing broken, Chief. But the ligaments around the elbow have been twisted pretty severely. (a smile) What in the world were you doing when you fell?
 BEVERLY / How's it working?
 BEVERLY / Alyssa, would you get me the --
 BEVERLY / -- Never mind. I'll do it. (to O'Brien) You, don't go away. We'll fix that right up.
 BEVERLY / (evenly) This is impossible.
 BEVERLY / Straighten your arm.
 BEVERLY / Alyssa?
 BEVERLY / Did you see anybody near the lab today?
 BEVERLY / You didn't happen to adjust the environments on the incubation containers?
 BEVERLY / Of course, I'm sorry, Alyssa.
 WORF / Probe approaching the T-tauri system, Captain.
 PICARD / Readings, Data?
 DATA / Coming in now, sir. The probe has moved within visual range of the planet.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / Sensors indicate a hydrogen-helium composition. (takes another reading) With a frozen helium core.
 RIKER / Wait a minute, didn't your readings indicate a Class M planet before we went through the wormhole, Data?
 DATA / It is very possible that interference from the wormhole affected the sensors, Commander. This is clearly not a Class M planet.
 PICARD / Data, run a full diagnostic to make sure the wormhole didn't cause any permanent damage to the sensors.
 DATA / Aye, Captain.
 PICARD / Ensign, set us back on a course for... (off Riker's doubt) Number One? A problem?
 RIKER / It's awfully strange that a malfunctioning sensor should give such a specific misreading of a planet. I would have thought that a space_time disturbance would cause a lot more confusion than that.
 DATA / It is conceivable that the sensors picked up the afterimage of an actual planet that lies on the other side of the wormhole. (to Picard) We could survey the nearby stars for such a planet. It would require approximately six weeks.
 PICARD / We don't have the time.
 PICARD / We've encountered a minor mystery, one that has been solved to my satisfaction. Number One, unless there's a major objection, Ensign McKnight will set us a course for Evadne Four.
 RIKER / No objection.
 PICARD / Ensign.
 PICARD / You wanted to see me, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / I have something of a minor mystery on my hands.
 PICARD / A "minor mystery"? That seems to be a recurring phrase around here lately. (indicating table) Please.
 PICARD / (surprised) Diomedian scarlet moss. I didn't know you were an enthno-botanist.
 BEVERLY / It's a hobby.
 PICARD / You've got a good crop going there. As I recall, it's not easy to cultivate.
 BEVERLY / That's just it -- I started the spores right before we were all knocked unconscious by the wormhole. You said we were out for thirty seconds?
 PICARD / Correct.
 BEVERLY / Then how come this shows a full day's growth?
 PICARD / Perhaps you've got some sort of fast-growth strain.
 BEVERLY / Each of these incubators were set with spores from completely different sources in the Diomedian system. I've got a dozen more back at the lab. Perhaps something extraordinary could have happened to one of them, but not to all of them.
 PICARD / But that would mean we were unconscious for a full day. And yet everything else on board indicates that we were out for only thirty seconds. The ship's chronometer, the computer...
 PICARD / (continuing) Everything else... including Commander Data.
 PICARD (V.O) / Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data continues to maintain that we were unconscious for only thirty seconds, despite Doctor Crusher's evidence to the contrary.
 DATA / Captain, I have a hypothesis.
 DATA / The twenty-second century physicist Pell Underhill conjectured that a major disruption in time-continuity could be compensated for by trillions of counter reactions.
 DATA / (continuing) The effect could have allowed Doctor Crusher's mosses to arrive at the other side of the worm hole with the unanticipated growth.
 GEORDI / Underhill was talking about energy!
 DATA / True. Nevertheless, it is possible that the phenomenon could occur in matter at much higher levels of organization. Given the proper conditions.
 PICARD / Thank you, Data. An intriguing hypothesis.
 PICARD / (continuing) Perhaps we've got a tempest in a test tube, after all.
 BEVERLY / Captain --
 PICARD / (lightly) Data, I promised Mister Nelson in Engineering that you would assist him on the sensor diagnostics. You'll find him hard at work on Deck Thirty-six.
 DATA / As you wish, Captain.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Did you believe Data's explanation?
 PICARD / (continuing) A frank answer, Commander.
 GEORDI / Not for a second. I'm honestly amazed that he even proposed it.
 WORF / What are you suggesting, Captain?
 PICARD / I'm not sure. I have never known Data to lie, and yet...
 BEVERLY / If we never went through a wormhole... then what happened to us during that missing day...
 GEORDI / If we were out for a whole day, why didn't our beards grow?
 RIKER / Whatever it was... it seems to be something Data doesn't want to tell us about...
 PICARD / It could be that whatever caused this situation affected Data as well. (beat) Or it could be that he's telling the truth... and this is just... another minor mystery.
 GEORDI / I can check the computer's chronometer... see if there's evidence of tampering...
 BEVERLY / A transporter trace analysis might give us another indication of how much time has actually passed.
 PICARD / Proceed on both counts. Meanwhile, we'll maintain our present course. If there is something wrong with Data, we don't want him aware of our suspicions.
 GEORDI / (lightly) Gentlemen, how goes the battle?
 DATA / The long-range, infra-red sensors suffered no apparent damage as a result of the wormhole. We are presently checking the neutrino and heavy particle detectors.
 GEORDI / Great. I'll take over, Data. The Captain wants you back on the Bridge.
 GEORDI / (continuing) See you later in Ten Forward.
 DATA / Yes. I will see you then.
 GEORDI / Nelson, I need your help with the computer.
 BEVERLY / Hello, Chief. How's the elbow?
 BEVERLY / No, it's not. Tell me, who was the last one to use the transporter before we went through the wormhole?
 BEVERLY / Have her report immediately to Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / Electrolyte concentration.
 BEVERLY / Interesting... (adjusting device) Let's check the cellular membrane. I'm willing to bet the internal turgor pressure is off by almost the same amount.
 BEVERLY / (excited) That's what I wanted to hear. (to Locklin) Thank you, Ensign Locklin. That'll be all.
 BEVERLY / Crusher to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (keying insignia) What is it, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I need to see you immediately.
 PICARD / I'm on my way to Engineering. Join me.
 BEVERLY / Physiologically, each of us is on a daily cycle. Our cells have developed rhythms based on a twenty-four hour period.
 PICARD / Our internal clocks.
 BEVERLY / Exactly, and I can measure that effect at the molecular level. I took a trace from the last person to use the transporter, and compared her cell function levels to what they are right now. If we were unconscious for only thirty seconds, those cycles would be nearly synchronous.
 PICARD / And were they?
 BEVERLY / No. We were out for longer than thirty seconds, Captain. A lot longer.
 GEORDI / (loudly) I've got some good news, and some bad news...
 GEORDI / The good news is that we were right about the computer's chronometer. There's a security program to prevent tampering. But it looks now like it was disabled, and a new program put in its place. Someone reset the clock.
 PICARD / And the bad news?
 GEORDI / Data and I are the only ones onboard this ship capable of doing it.
 DATA / A bit of a mystery, Captain.
 PICARD / That's an understatement. (beat) Is it possible that something or someone affected you -- without your knowledge?
 DATA / I am unable to answer that question, Captain.
 PICARD / Data, would you consent to being examined by Commander La Forge?
 DATA / As you wish, Captain.
 PICARD / (to com) Come.
 PICARD / Please escort Commander Data to Engineering.
 DATA / (to Picard) I know the way, Sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. It has become clear that everyone aboard the Enterprise has lost an entire day. As the mystery of what actually occurred during those missing hours continues to deepen, so do my doubts about Commander Data.
 GEORDI / We'll start with the higher functions before we get down to basics.
 GEORDI / (joking) Now, this won't hurt a bit...
 DATA / Have you forgotten that my sensory inputs are not programmed to experience pain, Geordi?
 GEORDI / It's a figure of speech. Bedside manner. I was just trying to make you comfortable.
 DATA / I am perfectly comfortable.
 GEORDI / (almost to himself) Pattern recognition, syntactic algorithms, heuristic functions -- all normal.
 DATA / However, I cannot help noticing that you appear a bit uncomfortable yourself.
 GEORDI / I just don't like having to do this, that's all...
 DATA / (puzzled) The Captain has expressed doubts about my operational capacities. Doubts which, given the circumstances, seem entirely justified. I do not understand your reluctance to carry out his instructions.
 GEORDI / It's not reluctance exactly... more like concern. I don't want to find something wrong with you. On the other hand...
 DATA / Yes?
 GEORDI / It feels like you're not being completely... honest with us. Data, I'm your freind... if something is wrong, tell me... maybe I can help you...
 DATA / (a beat) There is nothing I can tell you, Geordi, beyond what I have already stated.
 GEORDI / Okay.
 DATA / Okay...
 GEORDI / I've finished examining Data, Captain.
 PICARD / And?
 GEORDI / Nothing's wrong with the technology that I can see. He's in perfect condition.
 PICARD / I was almost hoping you'd find a problem.
 GEORDI / He could still be malfunctioning beyond my ability to detect it.
 PICARD / This entire mystery began when our sensors detected that planet. First it was class "M"... now it isn't...
 RIKER / But the sensors were malfunctioning. Our probe clearly established the planet could not support life...
 PICARD / Data launched that probe.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) If he rigged the probe, could you prove it?
 GEORDI / I could try.
 PICARD / What happened to us in that missing day? Surely clues must exist. Each of you think back to what you were doing right before we blacked out. Reenact it if need be. Look for anything odd or --
 WORF / -- Counselor!
 PICARD / Deanna, are you alright?
 TROI / (recovering) Just a moment... Yes... I'm fine...
 RIKER / What happened?
 TROI / I suddenly became dizzy... I'd better go to my quarters.
 PICARD / Perhaps Sickbay would be a better idea.
 TROI / (standing) No. Really, I'm alright.
 PICARD / See the counselor to her quarters.
 WORF / Aye, Captain.
 TROI / Thank you for coming with me, Worf.
 WORF / Of course. You're certain you are well.
 TROI / I just need some rest.
 WORF / Counselor!
 WORF / Security! Override the lock on Deanna Troi's quarters! Now!
 WORF / What's wrong?
 TROI / The mirror... I came in here... and I looked into the mirror... It wasn't me, Worf... Not me... It was my face, but it wasn't me inside...
 PICARD / Is she alright?
 TROI / I feel fine...now.
 BEVERLY / Signs of stress, adrenaline by-products higher than baseline. But that's a normal reaction to sudden fright. All brain functions check out okay.
 PICARD / Deanna, what happened?
 TROI / A hallucination perhaps.
 PICARD / What did you see?
 TROI / It wasn't what I saw. It was what I felt. I looked into the mirror, and it seemed a stranger was staring back at me from behind my own eyes.
 TROI / (continuing) As if my own face was a mask.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Yes, Geordi.
 GEORDI / (to Com) I found something, sir.
 BEVERLY / Hello, Worf.
 WORF / Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Can I help you?
 WORF / Perhaps not.
 BEVERLY / -- Worf.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) You came in here for something. You can trust me.
 WORF / A warrior does not complain about physical discomfort.
 BEVERLY / Are you in pain?
 WORF / But the Captain ordered us to report anything out of the ordinary.
 BEVERLY / How did this happen?
 PICARD / Do you recognize the planet, Data?
 DATA / Yes, it is the planet our probe detected in the T-tauri system.
 GEORDI / No it's not. Actually, it's Tethys Three. I retrieved the image from the ship's library. The geophysical figures have been slightly altered, but it's definitely Tethys Three.
 PICARD / (to Data) Strange that an obscure planet several hundred light years from here should be picked up by our probe.
 PICARD / Data, did you take this image from the ship's library and then program the probe to send it back to us?
 DATA / I cannot verify that hypothesis.
 PICARD / But you don't deny it.
 DATA / No, Sir.
 PICARD / Geordi, send another probe to the T-tauri system.
 GEORDI / Yes, Sir. (as he turns to go) Sorry, Data.
 PICARD / Counselor Troi just had a very disturbing hallucination.
 DATA / Is she alright?
 PICARD / For the moment. Can you tell me if Deanna's incident is in any way related to the missing time period?
 DATA / No, Sir. I cannot.
 PICARD / Data! You're the key to this entire mystery. And you've done nothing but block my attempts to solve it. Why are you fighting me?
 DATA / It is not by choice.
 PICARD / What does that mean?
 DATA / I cannot say.
 PICARD / You would rather endanger Deanna Troi, a friend, than tell me what's going on?!
 DATA / Which would you place first? The welfare of a single individual? Or that of the entire crew?
 PICARD / Are you saying that by not cooperating, you're actually protecting us?
 DATA / I am not saying that at all. I merely state a possible alternative explanation.
 PICARD / Then I'm going to ask you again. And I'm ordering you to respond directly. What really happened to us?
 DATA / I cannot answer that, Captain.
 PICARD / What would you have me do?! How would you handle this, if our positions were reversed?
 DATA / I am apparently guilty of falsifying the Enterprise's records. Of interfering with an investigation. Of disobeying a direct order from my commanding officer. Your duty seems clear.
 PICARD / Do you know what a court-martial would mean? Your career in Starfleet would be finished.
 DATA / I realize that.
 PICARD / Do you also realize that you would most likely be stripped down to the wires to find out what the hell went wrong?
 DATA / Yes, Sir. I do.
 BEVERLY / The wrist has been broken. Broken, reset, and treated with one of our subcutaneous bone fusion units.
 PICARD / During the missing day?
 BEVERLY / It's the only possibility.
 PICARD / You're suggesting he was conscious?
 BEVERLY / I'm suggesting maybe we all were. I certainly didn't repair a broken wrist while I was unconscious.
 PICARD / Our memories of that day?
 BEVERLY / Blocked. Possibly erased.
 PICARD / By whom?
 WORF / There are very few individuals on board who could have broken my wrist. (pause) Commander Data is one of those individuals.
 PICARD / I can't accept that explanation.
 WORF / He does possess the speed and strength.
 PICARD / Granted. But I am beginning to suspect that Data is refusing to cooperate because he believes he is acting in the best interests of the Enterprise.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (to Com) Yes, Geordi.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Our probe's approaching the planet, sir.
 PICARD / (to Com) Acknowledged.
 PICARD / Now maybe we'll get some answers.
 GEORDI / Visuals available now, Captain.
 RIKER / M-Class. Nickel-iron core, nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.
 PICARD / The same planet our sensors picked up before the so-called wormhole...
 RIKER / Affirmative.
 GEORDI / No indication of any space-time distortion whatsoever. The probe should at least be detecting a residual effect, even if the wormhole is inactive.
 PICARD / That's because there isn't a wormhole. There never was.
 PICARD / It was a ruse to throw us off the track. Look at the clues. Doctor Crusher's incubation experiment, the computer clock, the transporter trace all indicate the existence of a missing day. Worf's broken wrist suggests that we may have been awake and aware for that day, and possibly in a struggle for our lives.
 BEVERLY / The fact that we're alive suggests we must have won.
 PICARD / Not necessarily, Doctor. Data's behavior clearly suggests we did not. Why else would he be willing to sacrifice his career rather than tell us the truth?
 WORF / But if we didn't win and we didn't lose... ?
 PICARD / The only alternative left is a stalemate. A compromise might have been reached... a compromise that could have forced Data into silence.
 RIKER / But maybe by uncovering all this, we're in danger of upsetting the stalemate. Maybe it's best to leave well enough alone.
 PICARD / Possibly, Number One. And I would be willing to live with the mystery... but Data's role in this must be ascertained... or he will never be trusted with starship duty again. I cannot live with that.
 PICARD / (to McKnight) Ensign, take us back to the scene of the crime. Go to warp two.
 PICARD / Drop to impulse. Lieutenant Worf, maximum shields, ready all weapons.
 WORF / Shields up. Photon torpedos armed, phasers standing by. (a beat) Captain, an energy field has appeared between our position and the planet.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Hold position. Let's see what it does.
 WORF / The field has emitted an energy-pulse, approaching the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Too slow to be a photon torpedo.
 WORF / It might be a probe.
 PICARD / Let's see what happens when it hits the shields.
 WORF / Shields undamaged. The energy-pulse has dispersed.
 DATA / Counselor Troi. What is it?
 TROI / The plan has failed.
 DATA / You have returned.
 TROI / Your ship is again in our space.
 DATA / I was unable to prevent this.
 TROI / Regardless, you are here.
 DATA / Please. The Enterprise is not a threat to you. Give me more time. Our destruction would only --
 GEORDI / Data, the Captain wants me to take you to the Bridge. (to Troi; puzzled) Counselor...
 DATA / One moment, if you would.
 DATA / Please. Do nothing. It may yet be possible to salvage the situation.
 DATA / Reporting as ordered, Captain.
 PICARD / (indicating viewscreen) As you can see, we're back to where this all started.
 DATA / We must leave immediately.
 PICARD / Why?
 DATA / Any further delay will put all of our lives at grave risk.
 PICARD / Why? What is the source of that risk? (indicating screen) The energy field?
 DATA / I cannot say.
 PICARD / (temper rising) Data, you sound like you're stuck in a feedback loop. You have free will. You very well can say. You have a choice.
 DATA / My silence is not by choice, Sir.
 PICARD / Not by choice? (indicating screen) Are you somehow being controlled by that force? Did Geordi miss something when he examined you?
 DATA / Geordi's examination was exemplary.
 PICARD / Then why are you still compelled to disobey my orders? How --
 PICARD / During the missing day. Were you contacted by Starfleet? Were you given orders to conceal the truth from us?
 DATA / I cannot answer that question. We must leave.
 PICARD / Dammit, Data! It's the only explanation that makes sense! This ship is not going anywhere until I get an answer. Now who gave you such an order?
 DATA / You did, Sir.
 PICARD / I... ordered you to lie?
 WORF / (interrupting) Captain! The energy field is approaching!
 RIKER / Maintain shields at full intens--
 DATA / -- No! You must vary shield strength and shape as rapidly as possible. Maximum shields will only speed the ship's takeover.
 WORF / Contact imminent.
 PICARD / Do as Data says. Now!
 WORF / (touching controls) Aye, sir.
 WORF / The field is shifting amplitude... trying to match the shield...
 DATA / Captain, eventually the field will be able to penetrate our shields... There is no way to counter the Paxans' technology. We can delay their takeover -- we cannot prevent it.
 PICARD / The Paxans. Who are they?
 TROI / (futzed) You have invaded our system.
 DATA / You would only harm Counselor Troi's body.
 PICARD / (to Troi) We are explorers, not invaders.
 TROI / Your knowledge of us is unacceptable.
 DATA / They are xenophobes, Sir. Isolationists. The Paxans terraformed a protoplanet in this system to better conceal their whereabouts. The apparent wormhole we experienced during our previous encounter is actually a trap designed to keep away intruders.
 PICARD / Go on.
 DATA / The energy field stuns everyone on board the intruding ship putting them in a state of biochemical stasis.
 GEORDI / That explains why our beards didn't grow.
 DATA / Then the Paxans take the ship out of their territory.
 RIKER / The crew wakes up thinking they just went through a wormhole, so they count their blessings and keep going.
 DATA / Precisely.
 PICARD / What went wrong this time?
 DATA / My positronic brain is a technology unknown to the Paxans.
 TROI / Our stun-field had no effect on him. He remained conscious as we attempted to take over your ship.
 DATA / When I realized that I alone was able to act --
 DATA (V.O.) / (continuing) -- I initiated emergency procedures.
 DATA / Computer, the crew is incapacitated. Engage Emergency Plan Zed Zed Alpha.
 DATA / Computer, begin random fluctuation of shield frequency and modulation.
 DATA (V.O.) / With the Enterprise temporarily protected, I revived the crew.
 DATA / Computer, release compound A-D-T-H into the air flow system; five parts per million.
 PICARD / Status, Data?
 DATA / The energy field is attempting to match shield frequencies, Sir.
 PICARD / Options, Mister Worf?
 WORF / I do not recommend weapons at this range.
 PICARD / Can we go to warp?
 DATA / Negative. The field is also acting as a tractor beam.
 WORF / All systems are frozen, Captain.
 DATA (V.O.) / The Paxans can manipulate energy structures on many levels. They took control of Counselor Troi's body to communicate with us.
 WORF / Captain!
 PICARD / No! Everyone stop!
 PICARD / (to Troi, carefully) Who are you?
 TROI / You know of our existence. We have no choice but to destroy this ship.
 PICARD / If you destroy this ship, others will come searching for us. You may not be able to stop them all. Knowledge of your civilization could be spread across half the galaxy.
 TROI / No...
 PICARD / Allow us safe passage and we will protect your right to privacy to the best of our ability. We will tell no one of your existence.
 TROI / There are over a thousand lifeforms on this vessel. How could you assure their silence?
 PICARD / This biochemical stasis. Does it supress synaptic functions?
 TROI / It does.
 PICARD / Then you must have the capability of affecting memory. Could you erase the short term memory of everyone on this ship? Remove all knowledge of this event? Allow us to proceed as though it never happened?
 TROI / It would take time. One of your days. (indicates Data) And he is immune to our influence.
 PICARD / Data, I have to give you a most unusual order... I'm not quite sure how well you will be able to integrate it into your program...
 DATA / As a Starfleet officer, I am required to follow all of your orders, Captain.
 PICARD / Good. Because our survival depends upon it. I am ordering you never to reveal what has happened here today. Not to Starfleet, not even to myself. You will conceal your memory of the Paxans for as long as you live. Is that understood?
 DATA / Completely, Captain.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Satisfactory?
 TROI / (a beat) Agreed.
 PICARD / Excellent. (to everyone) Now, our task is to eliminate any information in the ship's records that might lead to knowledge of this incident. Let's get to work.
 DATA / We proceeded to erase all evidence of our encounter with the Paxans. I reset the computer's chronometer-and the crew was again stunned into unconsciousness and their short term memories erased. When they were revived a day later, the computer adjustments made it appear that only thirty seconds had passed.
 RIKER / And here we are.
 PICARD / (re: Troi) Here we are again.
 TROI / Your plan failed. This ship must be destroyed.
 PICARD / Wait. Please.
 PICARD / The plan failed because clues were left behind that suggested a mystery. And to many humans, a mystery must be solved. Doctor Crusher's incubation experiment, Worf's wrist, Troi's hallucinations... little pieces of evidence that led us to even more clues about the clock, the transporter trace, Data's odd behavior... Don't you see... without clues, there would be no mystery! If we were to simply eliminate all the clues and begin again...
 TROI / Again?
 PICARD / Exactly. Consider the first time a run-through, a rehearsal... to shake out all the flaws. The second time will succeed -- if we leave no clues.
 TROI / (beat) You are a most unusual species. Worthy of a second chance. Proceed.
 RIKER / Deanna?
 PICARD / Welcome back.
 PICARD / (continuing) Data, Geordi -- reconfigure the computer and all records. Number One, you're to oversee the rest of the ship. (to all) Let's get it right this time.
 PICARD / Data, what happened... ?
 DATA / The effect from the wormhole was rather intense.
 PICARD / I should say so...
 DATA / Everyone but myself was rendered unconscious. My positronic brain is immune to the effect.
 PICARD / How long were we out?
 DATA / Thirty seconds, Sir.
 RIKER / Current position?
 PICARD / It could be worse.
 DATA / Yes, Captain. The wormhole appears to have been a local phenomenon.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Bridge. What happened?
 PICARD / The ship just went through a wormhole. The entire crew was unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.
 BEVERLY / Anyone hurt on the Bridge?
 PICARD / (glancing around) Apparently not.
 BEVERLY / Acknowledged. Crusher out.
 PICARD / Status reports?
 RIKER / (checking console) No damage to Engineering.
 WORF / Shields and weapons systems unaffected.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / There's a general feeling of disorientation on board. Nothing serious as far as I can tell.
 PICARD / Well, then. We still have that anomalous M-Class planet to investigate. (to McKnight) Ensign, replot a course back to...
 DATA / Sir, it is likely that the anomalous readings were caused by the wormhole's effect. It was extremely unstable. I would recommend against returning. It might put the Enterprise at further risk.
 RIKER / We could sent a probe...
 DATA / (a little too quick) That would certainly be sufficient, Commander.
 PICARD / Make it so. And put out a hazard advisory to Starfleet.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Set a course to Evadne Four, Ensign.
 PICARD / Engage.
 CLOSE ON a wide sliding door opening... TWO MALCORIAN MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rush someone on a gurney through / the doors and into a small room crowded with medical equipment for emergency trauma care. The level of technology in evidence is approximately mid 21st century Earth with just enough differences to tell us that this is an alien world. There are two treatment bed_tables, cabinets and trays with medical instruments, and a display for reading scans. The Malcorians are humanoid with a slight difference in facial features... their hands are shaped like mittens without fingers (and if this is a difficult makeup job, they can all wear gloves.)
 RIKER / What happened?
 RIKER / I was caught in the riot when the police moved in... that's the last thing I remember.
 RIKER / Rivas. Rivas Jakara.
 RIKER / (well-rehearsed) In the Marta community on the southern continent...
 RIKER / No... I have no family.
 RIKER / I can't stay here... I have to get back...
 RIKER / I did have some cosmetic surgery... to correct a genetic birth defect...
 RIKER / (acknowledges, of course) Yes, isn't that something? My father's were the same way...
 RIKER / I understand your confusion. My personal physician is much more familiar with these... genetic irregularities... to be honest, I'd feel better if I were back home under her care...
 RIKER / (beat) Crusher... but actually, I'm not sure you'll be able to reach her.
 RIKER / She's taking... a sabbatical.
 RIKER / Oh, it's just a toy I was taking home... a present...
 RIKER / For a neighbor's child. (beat) Did they find anything else, I had one piece of jewelry... a metal pin...
 PICARD / Excuse me, Mirasta Yale?
 PICARD / My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This is my associate Deanna Troi. May we come in?
 TROI / Please don't be alarmed by our appearance... we've come with some... important information.
 PICARD / About space. About the universe you are preparing to enter.
 TROI / We are from a federation of planets, Mirasta... Captain Picard is from a planet called Earth more than two thousand light years from here. I am from another planet called Betazed.
 PICARD / We have been monitoring your progress toward warp drive capability. When a society reaches your level of technology and is clearly about to initiate warp travel, we believe it is time to make first contact. We prefer meeting like this rather than a random confrontation in deep space.
 TROI / We've come to you first because you are a leader in the scientific community. And scientists can generally accept our arrival more easily than others.
 PICARD / We almost always encounter fear and shock on this sort of mission. We hope you will be able to help facilitate our introduction.
 PICARD / (grins) I assure you this is no joke. (holding up his hands) You can see we are quite physically different than Malcorians. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / And with your permission, I am prepared to prove what I am saying.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Picard to Enterprise. Three to beam up.
 WORF / Welcome aboard.
 TROI / Now that you're about to travel beyond your own solar system, you will meet a great many more people from other planets, Mirasta...
 PICARD / The Federation prefers to make first contact like this... rather than a random confrontation in deep space.
 PICARD / We try to learn as much as possible about a planet before first contact.
 TROI / (gently smiles) One of the things we do is monitor broadcast signals... We listen to your journalism, your music, your humor... try to better understand you as a people...
 PICARD / To be sure, we get an incomplete picture from long distance... that's why we also do on-surface reconnaissance.
 TROI / For several years.
 PICARD / (off her reaction) We've found that the most hazardous aspect of this kind of mission is a lack of sufficient information...
 PICARD / We do have a complication here, Mirasta. One of our people is missing. My first officer, Commander William Riker. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / He was on the surface to coordinate the final details with our observation team when he disappeared. Our people have made inquiries... but we have not been able to locate him. If there's any way you can help...
 TROI / The capital city. He was there under the name of Rivas Jakara, a tourist from the Marta community.
 TROI / It never is.
 PICARD / What about Durken?
 PICARD / But, with the disappearance of Commander Riker, wouldn't it be prudent...
 RIKER / There's obviously been some misunderstanding...
 RIKER / Not one of you... ?
 RIKER / (laughs) Do you realize what you're saying?
 RIKER / It is far more likely that I'm a weather balloon than an alien.
 RIKER / I guess I'm another case for the medical journals then...
 PICARD / The security chief and a medical officer are always present during a first contact transport -- a matter of policy... we've learned to expect the unexpected...
 PICARD / "Beamed up"...
 PICARD / Personally, I have been involved with four first contact missions.
 PICARD / They're still there, Chancellor.
 PICARD / This vessel also carries families and children, Chancellor. It is not a warship. The Federation is dedicated to the peaceful exploration of space.
 PICARD / Not at all, Chancellor. Some desire membership. Some do not. And in some cases the philosophical differences are so great, it is not even a consideration...
 DATA is in the Command Chair. WORF and supernumeraries / fill the other posts. The door opens, Picard, Durken, and Mirasta ENTER. Data stands in greeting.
 PICARD / This is my bridge.
 DATA / Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Data. Allow me to introduce Chancellor Avel Durken and Space Administrator Mirasta Yale.
 DATA / How do you do?
 PICARD / Data is my Second Officer.
 DATA / In a manner of speaking. The term "artificial lifeform" is more accurate.
 PICARD / Mister Data will escort you to the transporter room.
 DATA / No, Minister. He has not returned to our designated transport coordinates. We have continued to scan the capitol city without success.
 PICARD / I've been saving this for a special occasion. My brother on Earth produces fruit known as grapes which he turns into wine. He's really quite good at it.
 PICARD / We have a tradition, Chancellor, called a toast... a drink to salute one's friends and good fortune. I propose a toast to a new friendship.
 PICARD / I am sure we will find much in common.
 PICARD / An opportunity to learn from one another.
 PICARD / Trust requires time and experience...
 PICARD / Chancellor, we are not here to conquer.
 PICARD / Today, all I wish to have is a drink between friends. (Durken smiles) A beginning. How we proceed is entirely up to you...
 PICARD / There will be no conflict.
 PICARD / We would leave and never return. (beat) We are only here to help guide you... into a new era. I assure you we will not interfere with the natural development of your planet... that is, in fact, our Prime Directive.
 PICARD / That is not the whole meaning... but it is part of it.
 PICARD / To instantly transform a society with technology would be harmful and destructive...
 PICARD / How shall you answer them tonight, Chancellor?
 RIKER / Good. Because there's nothing to be afraid of...
 RIKER / Can you help me get out of here?
 RIKER / No, I'm not an alien...
 RIKER / Listen, I really have to leave...
 RIKER / To the left. All right. Let's do it.
 RIKER / You know why. Because I don't belong here. Because I have to get back to my ship in space.
 RIKER / Now, will you help me?
 RIKER / What?
 RIKER / Listen, Miss...
 RIKER / I really have to get going... all the... other aliens are expecting me...
 RIKER / It's not that easy. There are... differences... in the way my people make love.
 RIKER / But...
 RIKER / I'll call you next time I'm passing through your star system.
 PICARD / (greeting) Chancellor...
 PICARD / (toss away) I know how busy you are.
 PICARD / In what respect?
 PICARD / Commander Riker.
 PICARD / (beat) Mirasta felt it would be a mistake to discuss...
 PICARD / You're right. It was my error, not hers.
 PICARD / Chancellor, no starship mission is more dangerous than first contact. We never know what we face when we open the door to a new world. How will we be greeted? What are the dangers? Centuries ago, a disastrous first contact with the Klingon Empire led to decades of war. It was decided then that we must do surveillance before making contact. It was a controversial decision. But I believe it prevents more problems than it creates.
 PICARD / (nods) In time, there would have been full disclosure. I know I can only ask you to believe that. On some worlds, it is not even an issue. But here, everything our observers reported suggested the people of this world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival. We could see our surveillance might even be interpreted as an act of aggression. (beat) I was hoping that we would find Commander Riker before you did... so the matter would not complicate our introduction. And it was a mistake.
 PICARD / Like it?
 PICARD / Oh, I've made some fine ones in my time.
 PICARD / Will you release my officer?
 PICARD / (to insignia) Enterprise, one to beam up.
 RIKER / Please. Bring my people here.
 RIKER / We... are here on a mission of peace...
 RIKER / It is... for defense...
 RIKER / No...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Captain, Chancellor Durken has requested your immediate presence on the surface. It's in regard to Commander Riker.
 PICARD / Acknowledged, Lieutenant.
 BEVERLY / I'm a physician... don't be frightened... (seeing Krola) What happened?
 BEVERLY / (keys insignia) Crusher to Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker is near death. But there is still brain activity... I've got to take him back to the ship...
 PICARD / Acknowledged.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Minister Krola has a phaser wound in his upper chest.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I should take him with us.
 PICARD / (tacit approval) We'll meet you on the Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / Enterprise, five to beam up... directly to Sickbay... energize...
 BEVERLY / They're both going to be okay... we were able to stabilize Will... if we'd been any later...
 BEVERLY / He was never in any real danger... the phaser was on stun...
 PICARD / It is a defensive weapon. We do not use it to kill. (to Beverly) Have you been able to ascertain what happened?
 BEVERLY / I have a good idea. Based on the angle of impact... it suggests that Krola had his right hand on the phaser when it went off...
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head) Commander Riker was in no position to offer any kind of struggle, Chancellor.
 PICARD / It is your decision, Chancellor. But I must say I regret that we won't have the opportunity of knowing your people better.
 PICARD / But how can you keep us a secret... when so many have seen and heard so much?
 PICARD / (to Mirasta) We may not be back in your lifetime. And I have to believe that you are not fully prepared for the risks of space, Mirasta...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, to my Ready Room...
 PICARD / Escort Chancellor Durken to the transporter room, Lieutenant... and then assign quarters to Minister Yale. She'll be staying on board.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Until we return then...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44614.6: We are approaching Starbase Three-One-Three, where we will pick up a shipment of scientific equipment for a Federation outpost in the Guernica System. At the same time --
 PICARD (V.O.) / -- we will be hosting a special guest.
 GEORDI / You wanted to see me, Captain?
 PICARD / Yes, Mister La Forge. It seems that the exemplary nature of your work has caught the attention of Starfleet Command.
 GEORDI / Well... that's very flattering. Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / In fact, someone is coming on board just to see some of the engine modifications you have made.
 GEORDI / Who's that, Captain?
 PICARD / The Senior Design Engineer of the Theoretical Propulsion Group -- Doctor Leah Brahms.
 GEORDI / Leah's coming here? That's terrific!
 PICARD / You know Doctor Brahms?
 GEORDI / Well, of course I do! I --
 GEORDI / I mean, I've studied her -- her schematics for years. She was responsible for a lot of the engine design on the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Well, it should be an enjoyable visit, then. She'll be transporting on board as soon as we arrive at the Starbase. Would you like to greet her on our behalf?
 GEORDI / (restrained) Why... yes, Captain. I'd be happy to serve that function.
 GEORDI / I guess I'm a little nervous... it's not every day a man comes face to face with a dream...
 GEORDI / Remember... about a year ago... when we were caught in that booby-trap the Menthars set?
 GEORDI / While we were trying to get out of it, I went to the holodeck to study an engine prototype that was built when the Enterprise was first designed...
 GEORDI / And the computer... well, it gave me an image of the engine... but it also created a hologram of the designer. Doctor Leah Brahms.
 GEORDI / But what a computer-simulated female... She was brilliant, of course... but warm, friendly... (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / We worked like one person... what I didn't think of, she did... I'd start sentences, she'd finish them. It was just so -- comfortable...
 GEORDI / Okay, I know it was just a holographic image... but the computer was able to incorporate personality traits from her Starfleet record.
 GEORDI / You've got it wrong, Guinan. I'm not necessarily expecting anything romantic. I just know that, whatever else, Leah Brahms and I will be good friends.
 GEORDI / Okay. Bring her over.
 GEORDI / Hi!
 GEORDI / I mean... welcome aboard, Doctor Brahms. I'm Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge. Chief Engineer.
 GEORDI / Experience has shown me that too high a ratio diminishes efficiency. I worked with the mixture until I got the right balance.
 GEORDI / Right. Again, I adjusted the flow... sometimes in space things work a little differently than they do on the drawing board.
 GEORDI / No, of course not. It's just... a well-known fact. There's theory... and there's application. They don't always jibe.
 GEORDI / You bet. I found the Starfleet estimates of MTBF units were unrealistic. I determined my own schedule based on observation and experience.
 GEORDI / In the first place, Doctor, I'm not aware of needing any defense... in the second place --
 GEORDI / (gesturing) In my office. Be my guest.
 RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations. ENSIGN RAGER / at Con.
 DATA / Commander, I am picking up some unusual readings from the Alpha Omicron system.
 DATA / (continuing) At this range, all I can discern is that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy.
 RIKER / What type of radiation signature?
 DATA / Unknown, sir. (beat) Commander, the Alpha Omicron system has not yet been charted. I recommend that we take this opportunity for further research.
 RIKER / We're way ahead of schedule... (to Rager) Alter course for Alpha Omicron.
 DATA / The anomaly is orbiting the seventh planet. It is a mass of plasma energy contained within discrete boundaries by an outer covering of silicates, actinides, and carbonaceaous chondrites.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 PICARD / Is it a ship?
 WORF / (reading console) It does not conform to any known design.
 RIKER / Any records of similar phenomena in Starfleet listings?
 DATA / (processes for a moment) None, sir. This has never been seen before.
 PICARD / Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter impulse. Bring us into orbit around the seventh planet. Maintain a relative distance of ten kilometers from the object.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Alert all science labs to standby. They should be coordinating their efforts with Commander Data.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / Doctor Brahms... there's no reason for us to argue... we're both on the same side, here...
 GEORDI / So, why don't I take you on a little tour... show you the adjustments I've made... why I think they work... and... we can start pulling together on this.
 GEORDI / Okay... for instance, here in the dilithium chamber...
 GEORDI / You remember, the crystal's been reoriented to adjust the direction of the lattice structure.
 GEORDI / Right, why would you? The ship was having some difficulties, so we made the modification. Hoping it would work. And... it did.
 GEORDI / Well, not exclusively...
 GEORDI / (nodding, finishing her sentence) ... in the next class starship.
 GEORDI / (faltering) I didn't... It was the next logical step. (off her look) Doctor, sometimes we have to fly by the seat of our pants out here... and it stands to reason that now and then we're gonna come up with the same solutions you do...
 GEORDI / Listen. I've got a personnel review scheduled to start in about five minutes, and it's been a long day for you. How about we... we get together later. Sort of... plan our agenda for the next day or two.
 GEORDI / What it is we want to accomplish... the best way to go about it... and -- get to know each other. It might make things easier.
 GEORDI / Okay -- nineteen hundred hours... my quarters. Maybe we'll even have a bite to eat... I make great fungilli.
 GEORDI / Is that right... ?
 DATA / Sensors are having difficulty penetrating the interior. However, the pattern of radiated output suggests a coherent system of energy storage and utilization.
 RIKER / Then it was constructed by someone?
 DATA / It is a possibility, sir. However, sensor data gathered thus far suggests this is a naturally occurring phenomenon with biological properties.
 PICARD / A lifeform?
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / (almost to himself) "Asked the child of the stranger without any name... whither you go... and whence you came?"
 WORF / "To the child's delight the answer came clear... To the end I go for it all starts here."
 PICARD / It seems we were bread and buttered on the same nursery rhymes, Mister Worf.
 RIKER / Mister Data, prepare three class five probes for launch. Mister Worf, begin compiling readings for transmission to Starfleet Headquarters. (beat) Ensign... aft thrusters. Standard observation posture.
 PICARD / (to Troi) What would it be like, Counselor... no ship, no bulky spacesuit... just to live between the stars... and know that the entire galaxy was your home... ?
 WORF / We are being probed. Recommend we raise shields, sir...
 PICARD / Negative. If we're curious about it, it has a right to be curious about us... (to Troi) Counselor, is this "curiosity" motivated by instinct or intelligence?
 TROI / It's impossible to tell, Captain.
 DATA / Change in readings, Captain. The lifeform has increased its energy output by fifty percent.
 WORF / It is moving toward us, sir!
 PICARD / (to Rager) Reverse course, Ensign, easily... three hundred k.p.h. Nothing to alarm or provoke it...
 DATA / We are being held, in an energy damping field, sir.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Raise shields.
 WORF / No effect, Captain.
 PICARD / Reverse power, full impulse.
 DATA / No change in our position.
 RIKER / Red Alert!
 PICARD / (to com) Commander La Forge, prepare to initiate the warp drive.
 GEORDI / (to com) Sorry, Captain... there's too much inteference to form a warp field.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Commander.
 RIKER / All decks are to begin radiation protocol.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged. Crusher out.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... ready main phasers... minimum power.
 WORF / Ready.
 PICARD / Fire.
 DATA / Radiation levels dropping back to normal, Captain.
 DATA / The energy patterns are breaking down... the lifeform's radiation signature is no longer stable.
 DATA / Energy output is negligible... radiation patterns are no longer coherent. (beat) I believe it is dead, sir.
 PICARD / We are out here to explore, to make contact with other lifeforms, to establish peaceful relations, but not to interfere and absolutely not to destroy. And yet look what we have just done -- what I have just done.
 TROI / Captain, everything you did was consistent with established Starfleet procedures... what happened was an accident... unavoidable...
 PICARD / The Bridge is yours, Number One.
 DATA / Captain, sensors are picking up a new energy reading from the lifeform.
 PICARD / Elaborate, Mister Data...
 DATA / There is a new concentration of ionizing radiation growing in the center of its body.
 PICARD / (hoping) Then -- perhaps it's still alive...
 GEORDI / Computer... subdued lighting.
 GEORDI / No, no, too much. I just want it -- nice. You know. Cozy.
 GEORDI / It's not a matter of precision, it's a matter of... mood. (beat) Brighter than this.
 GEORDI / More... more... a little more -- there! That's perfect. Now, music... maybe a little soft jazz...
 GEORDI / No... not right... maybe -- oh, I got it! Of course -- Brahms! A piano etude...
 GEORDI / No, that's corny. Probably everybody tries that... computer... how about... guitar. Classical guitar. Anybody.
 GEORDI / Come on in!
 GEORDI / Well, you know the uniform is so... formal...
 GEORDI / Am I? I just wanted to make you... feel more comfortable.
 GEORDI / You know... your hair is different...
 GEORDI / No, no... I mean... different than... I expected. From your Starfleet records...
 GEORDI / It's just... standard procedure for guests coming aboard... protocol. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / Nothing specific... actually.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Please. Sit down. Would you like anything to drink?
 GEORDI / I know that.
 GEORDI / I'm sure they're wrong.
 GEORDI / ... they're like your children.
 GEORDI / So naturally you're a little possessive about them.
 GEORDI / Sure. I feel a little like that myself.
 GEORDI / Maybe you just haven't met the right people.
 GEORDI / I'm starving... why don't we have some dinner.
 GEORDI / Please. Call me Geordi.
 GEORDI / (dashed) You can't --?
 GEORDI / Well, sure...
 GEORDI / Computer -- turn up the damn lights. And get rid of that stupid guitar.
 DATA / This new concentration of energy was detected only after the surrounding material became inert.
 RIKER / Could this be some sort of... tissue regeneration?
 DATA / The radiation signature is similar to the original pattern, but there are significant differences.
 PICARD / Some kind of reaction to our phaser fire, perhaps...
 DATA / I believe this is separate and self-contained within the body of the dead lifeform.
 RIKER / Another entity... ?
 DATA / Yessir. It appears to be a smaller, less developed version of the original creature.
 PICARD / No wonder it attacked us. It was about to give birth.
 BEVERLY, Picard, Riker, Worf, and Troi. / 
 BEVERLY / It's dangerous to generalize about new lifeforms... but based on my experience with other beings that bear their young in this manner, I'd say the offspring is still premature. Otherwise, it would be able to break through the outer body shell of the parent.
 PICARD / Will this... child be able to survive on its own without the parent?
 BEVERLY / There's no way to tell. We don't have enough information about the bio-functions of the adult, much less the child.
 TROI / Is there something we can do to help?
 BEVERLY / If we were in Sickbay, I'd try a Cesarean section... the first priority is to free it from the parent's body.
 RIKER / (thinks) We could use our phasers like a scalpel...
 BEVERLY / (nods) Yes... that might work...
 WORF / I advise against this, Captain. The parent proved to be a threat to the ship... we do not know how the offspring will react.
 PICARD / Your objection is noted... but we are directly responsible for the death of the parent. We cannot simply walk away now. (to Beverly) We'll proceed at your discretion, Doctor.
 GEORDI / Morning.
 GEORDI / You realize the only way to inspect them is to crawl inside...
 GEORDI / Watch out for the power taps.
 GEORDI / You're probably the only other person in the galaxy who could pick that up.
 GEORDI / It's right up here.
 GEORDI / A mid-range phase adjuster... it puts the plasma back into phase after inertial distortion.
 GEORDI / That's not my strong suit, Doctor...
 GEORDI / Maybe we could collaborate. Writing is one of your strong points.
 GEORDI / I... studied you. Your writings, your Starfleet file. I've admired you. Your work.
 GEORDI / I've looked forward to meeting you for a long time...
 GEORDI / (continuing) And I'd like to think -- that we could get to be friends. Good friends.
 BEVERLY / Set phaser power to three percent, narrow beam.
 WORF / (works console) Three percent.
 BEVERLY / (deep breath) All right... here we go.
 DATA / First incision is complete.
 BEVERLY / Ideally, the offspring should be able to push through the outer shell on its own now.
 RIKER / It needs a little more help.
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head) We've done all we can. I don't want to risk hitting the child by accident.
 TROI / Come on... you can do it...
 BEVERLY / Captain, I'd like to announce the birth of a large baby... something.
 PICARD / Well done, Doctor. Well done.
 GEORDI / A glitch, a malfunction in the holodeck... it's the only explanation I can think of... it's a miracle we ever got out of that booby-trap alive... how could it have been so far off? It was based on every piece of information on record about Leah Brahms... okay, with an admitted margin for error... but this is an error that's a light year wide...
 GEORDI / Hoped for... ? She's about as friendly as a Circassian Plague Cat... all she cares about is her work... she hates what I've done to her engines... and to top it off -- she's married! The computer never even told me she was married...
 GEORDI / Must've been...
 GEORDI / What are you talking about?
 GEORDI / This is the same VISOR.
 GEORDI / What's that supposed to mean?
 DATA / The lifeform's patterns are stable, Captain. It seems able to withstand the solar radiation without difficulty.
 PICARD / Good. (to Conn) Ensign Rager, set course for the Guernica system.
 RIKER / We're not staying?
 PICARD / No. We've done what we can to help... now it's time to move on. This... child will live the rest of its life without any further interference from us.
 RIKER / It might be wise to put some distance between us before initiating the warp drive.
 PICARD / Very well. (to Rager) Five hundred k.p.h., Ensign. Engage.
 WORF / Captain, it's following us... maintaining a distance of four kilometers directly astern.
 PICARD / (to Rager) Seventeen degrees to port, Ensign Rager.
 WORF / It's turning with us, sir.
 RIKER / Increase to one half impulse.
 WORF / It is matching our velocity.
 TROI / (with sudden understanding) It's imprinted on us. (off Picard's look) It thinks the Enterprise is... its mother.
 DATA / (reads console) A change in energy readings, sir. I am reading an internal buildup of gamma particles in---
 WORF / Its velocity is increasing... it's moving directly toward the ship!
 PICARD / Evasive maneuvers, full...
 RIKER / Report...
 WORF / Minor damage...
 DATA / Sir, the creature is now in direct contact with the hull.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / Sir, the lifeform is draining energy directly from the fusion reactors.
 TROI / (realizing) Feeding off the energy of the Enterprise as it would from its mother.
 WORF / What action should we take, Captain?
 PICARD / (a beat) None, Lieutenant. None at all.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Since the newborn has attached itself to the hull, it has been making greater and greater demands on the ship's energy, but we have been able to temporarily stabilize our power systems.
 PICARD / How long before the power drain becomes critical, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / If it continues to increase at the current rate, six, seven hours, maybe...
 PICARD / (to Leah) Your help would be appreciated, Doctor.
 GEORDI / By then, maybe Junior won't need us any more.
 PICARD / (a thoughtful beat) Data, is there any way to determine what the destination of the parent might have been?
 DATA / I can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on when we encountered it, sir.
 BEVERLY / (understanding what Picard is thinking) Perhaps it was on the way to a safe and supportive environment for its newborn.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) We might be able to deliver it to the same destination.
 RIKER / Which raises the question of how to get Junior off the hull when we get there...
 GEORDI / ... the pressure from inside the ship might push it away from the hull.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / (puzzled) Is the appellation "Junior" to be the lifeform's official name from now on?
 PICARD / No. It's not.
 GEORDI / We've run into similar problems before... that's actually why I reoriented the dilithium crystal...
 GEORDI / Right.
 GEORDI / Sure. It's in the computer --
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to La Forge...
 GEORDI / (keying com) La Forge here...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander, I need to see you on the Bridge.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir, be right there. (to Leah) You go ahead, Doctor... Ensign Pavlik can show you the file on the engine modifications.
 GEORDI / She went where?
 GEORDI / Of course not... nothing at all...
 GEORDI / Computer, freeze program.
 GEORDI / No, you don't... it wasn't the way it might look...
 GEORDI / It's not like that, I swear --
 GEORDI / Nothing like that happened. It was a professional collaboration.
 GEORDI / If you watched the whole program, you saw what it was... we worked together to solve a problem. In a crisis situation --
 GEORDI / Ever since you came on board, you've been badgering me... and I've taken it. I've shown you courtesy, and respect, and a hell of a lot of patience. I've tried to understand you and I've tried to get along with you...
 GEORDI / And in return, you've accused me, tried and convicted me without bothering to hear my side of it. So -- I'm guilty, okay? But not of what you think... of something much worse...
 GEORDI / I'm guilty of reaching out to you... of hoping we could connect... I'm guilty of a terrible crime, Doctor -- I offered you friendship.
 WORF / Its total volume has increased by eight point five percent in the last three hours. I am now reading it as forty-six million cubic meters. (TECH)
 DATA / Captain, I have completed the analysis of the parent's course through this system.
 RIKER / It was heading for an asteroid belt...
 PICARD / Ensign Rager, set course two five nine mark three one eight, one half impulse.
 PICARD / Hold position five hundred kilometers from the periphery of the asteroid field...
 WORF / (works console) Difficulty getting a clear sensor reading beyond four thousand kilometers.
 DATA / The asteroids contain large quantities of meklinite, which is interferring with our scanners. (beat) I am also detecting traces of Kefnium, a compound which was found in the parent being's outer shell. It is likely that the asteroids provide sustenance for this lifeform.
 RIKER / We could leave the child here. If Data's right, it would have an ample supply of food.
 PICARD / (thinks) Agreed. (to com) Mister La Forge, are you ready to separate our guest from the hull?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 GEORDI / (to com) I'm deactivating the atmospheric force field now, Captain.
 PICARD / (to com) Engineering, report!
 DATA / Captain, the offspring is emitting a high frequency radio transmission.
 RIKER / Is it trying to communicate?
 RIKER / Take the engines off-line. Supplement with auxiliary power.
 RIKER / (continuing; to Worf) All decks go to emergency condition seven. Life support and critical operations only.
 PICARD / (to com) Mister La Forge, what is your status?
 GEORDI / I'm sorry, Captain... the bay's been completely depressurized, but... it's still hanging on.
 DATA / I am detecting other radio transmissions, Captain.
 WORF / Sensors detecting movement within the asteroid field... distance, two million kilometers, bearing two-five-seven mark one-six-one.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / (to Picard) At their current speed, the entities will intercept us in ten minutes, thirty-one seconds.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Weapons status?
 WORF / (reads console) Auxiliary power only... two seconds phaser fire available.
 GEORDI / Ensign... power readings.
 GEORDI / Keep your eye on the generator console. We've got less than six minutes to get that baby off our back before his relatives get here...
 GEORDI / (to himself) Whatever we try, junior responds by sucking up more energy...
 GEORDI / (just as cool) Of course. What is it?
 GEORDI / I'm listening.
 GEORDI / ... make it unpalatable somehow...
 GEORDI / (continuing) ... but the emergency generators are all we've got...
 GEORDI / Exactly... unless...
 GEORDI / This is a space baby, right? I mean, these creatures are born, live, and die in interstellar space?
 GEORDI / Okay. All matter in space vibrates in a specific radiation band...
 GEORDI / And that might be just enough to pour a little vinegar in baby's milk.
 GEORDI / If we're gradual enough, it won't be a shock. Hopefully it'll just lose interest.
 GEORDI / (keys com) La Forge to Bridge...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / Doctor Brahms and I have a plan, Captain.
 WORF / Two minutes until the creatures intercept, sir.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, we're ready down here.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 GEORDI / Lowering wavelength in the energy system, now...
 GEORDI / Any reaction, Bridge?
 DATA / Negative. I detect no reduction in the lifeform's rate of energy consumption.
 WORF / One minute thirty seconds to intercept.
 GEORDI / Okay... not sour enough. Leah, take it down further.
 GEORDI / I guess it noticed what we're doing.
 DATA / The lifeform is emitting its high frequency transmission... energy consumption is rising...
 WORF / Captain -- the creatures are accelerating their approach... they're changing color!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Mister La Forge --
 GEORDI / Just a little more time, Captain--! (to Leah) Nudge it down... toward point-oh-two...
 WORF / Intercept in thirty seconds.
 DATA / Auxiliary generators are losing power, Captain...
 DATA / The entity has disengaged, sir.
 DATA / Power returning to normal levels, Captain.
 RIKER / Bring the engines on line. And take us out of here.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge... Doctor Brahms... congratulations. You have weaned the baby.
 GEORDI / (to Leah) Good work.
 GEORDI / Yeah... yeah, I'll admit... I did get a little... attached to that lady in the holodeck...
 GEORDI / I never asked... and the computer is notorious for not volunteering information... tell me about him...
 GEORDI / I'm sure...
 GEORDI / I do?
 GEORDI / No you don't. I should have told you straight out...
 GEORDI / The look on my face... ? The look on your face, I'll remember that a long time.
 GEORDI / I'm just glad I finally got the chance to know you... the real you.
 GEORDI / (warm smile) Not so different... not so different at all.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to La Forge... there's an incoming message on subspace for Doctor Brahms...
 GEORDI / Acknowledged, Worf. La Forge out.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44631.2. We are proceeding through the uncharted rim of a binary star system, where we may have located the U.S.S. Brattain. The missing science vessel failed to arrive at its destination and has not been heard from since a distress call twenty-nine days ago.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, TROI at their stations; / ENSIGN RAGER at Conn. On the viewscreen at a distance, a space craft floats adrift.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / It's the Brattain, all right.
 DATA / The ship is intact, sir, with no indications of structural damage.
 RIKER / Engines?
 DATA / All propulsion systems are shut down. The ship is drifting.
 PICARD / Life form readings?
 DATA / (beat) Inconclusive, sir.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / There is life on board... but...
 PICARD / What is it?
 TROI / I don't know... something...
 PICARD / Number One, assemble your team.
 RIKER / (keys insignia) Doctor Crusher, report to Transporter Room Three. (to them) Data, Worf...
 TROI / Commander... I need to go, also...
 DATA / There is no indication of malfunction in any of the main systems.
 WORF (V.O.) / Here's another one.
 WORF / This was done by a phaser... at a setting of six or seven...
 RIKER / There are more over here...
 BEVERLY / The entire Bridge crew...
 RIKER / Whoever did this... may still be on board.
 TROI / There's someone alive... but he didn't kill these people...
 TROI / Here...
 BEVERLY / He's alive...
 TROI / I think he is Betazoid...
 TROI / It's all right. We're going to help you.
 TROI / What happened here? Who did this to you?
 BEVERLY / We're almost finished with the autopsies, Captain.
 PICARD / How long will it take you to compile the data?
 BEVERLY / It's complicated -- the dead were found everywhere... some locked in their rooms -- barricaded, with weapons piled around them... some in corridors where they'd obviously had hand-to-hand combat... I'll have to sort through and analyze the details.
 BEVERLY / We've identified him as Andrus Hagan, from Betazed, science advisor. He's in a profound catatonic state.
 TROI / I'm not getting much, Captain... a few words, disconnected phrases. I can feel his terror... but I can't seem to reach him.
 PICARD / Don't give up on him, Counselor. We're examining the Brattain for clues -- but this man is the only one left who knows what happened there.
 TROI (V.O.) / I'm here. I'm right here. There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
 TROI (V.O.) / You hear voices? What do they say?
 TROI (V.O.) / Keep talking to me... I'll try to understand...
 GEORDI / All engines check out perfectly, Commander. Once we get them started up, the Brattain can get back to Starbase under her own power.
 RIKER / Let's give it a try.
 GEORDI / Pre-heating injectors... Data, fuel flow?
 DATA / Matter valves are open and operating. Magnetic containment on the anti-matter pods is constant.
 GEORDI / Okay, open injectors.
 DATA / Injectors open.
 DATA / There is no engine activity at all.
 RIKER / What's wrong, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Nothing's wrong. I don't understand it.
 PICARD / Come.
 BEVERLY / I've been studying the autopsy reports... the conclusion is appalling.
 BEVERLY / There was no outside source... no alien presence... The crew of the Brattain, all thirty-four of them -- appear to have killed each other.
 PICARD / What could have caused such an event? Drugs? A virus? Poison...
 BEVERLY / Toxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their systems. And they were in good health. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / (beat) But for whatever reason, they seem to have turned against each other, using phasers, knives -- and bare hands.
 BEVERLY / I'd like you to see this, Captain. It's from the logs of the Brattain. Captain Zaheva's mental condition deteriorated steadily after they became stranded... she began talking of plots and mutinies...
 BEVERLY / This is the last entry... made after they had been adrift for over three weeks.
 TROI / Be sure to call me if there's any change in his condition. I'll be in my office.
 TROI / Where are you?
 TROI / I'm coming. Where are you?
 TROI / Where are you?!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44635.8: Four days have passed, but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of the Brattain. I have decided we will return to Starbase Two-twenty...
 PICARD (V.O.) / ... and to that end, Commander La Forge is rigging the Brattain for towing.
 GEORDI / (rising) I'm going to try re-calibrating the field generators. I still don't see why we can't get the engines going... it just doesn't make any sense.
 GEORDI / Ensign... what is it?
 GEORDI / The ship was searched thoroughly. There's no one left aboard.
 GEORDI / (gently) Thirty-four people were found dead on this ship. That could make anyone uneasy.
 TROI (V.O.) / I'm here... can you hear me?
 TROI (V.O.) / Tell me about the voices you hear...
 TROI (V.O.) / I don't understand... tell me more about the poles...
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / (a bit more forcefully) Come.
 PICARD / Come...
 BEVERLY / Captain, do you have a moment?
 TROI / We're concerned... whatever happened on the Brattain -- may be starting here.
 PICARD / Explain...
 TROI / Beverly and I have both gotten unusual reports... people behaving strangely... others hearing sounds that aren't there...
 PICARD / Are we talking about hallucinations?
 BEVERLY / In some cases. In others -- just erratic behavior.
 TROI / We can't track down any common element that might be responsible.
 PICARD / But everything started when we found the Brattain...
 BEVERLY / Yes. Captain -- we have to get the Enterprise away from here... before it gets worse...
 PICARD / We are preparing to take the Brattain in tow. We'll be on our way within the hour.
 PICARD / Ensign, maneuver us into position within tractor beam range.
 DATA / Is there a problem, Ensign?
 DATA / Ready now, Captain.
 PICARD / Ensign Rager, report to Sickbay.
 PICARD / Ensign Lin, put us into position to engage the tractor beam.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, ready tractor beam.
 DATA / Ensign... we are losing maneuverability. Did you throttle down by mistake?
 DATA / Captain... thrusters are losing power.
 PICARD / Impulse engines... ahead minimum power.
 RIKER / Riker to Engineering... what's going on down there?
 GEORDI / I don't know, sir... nothing's responding...
 PICARD / Ensign, go to warp engines -- factor one. Engage.
 GEORDI / Captain, we don't have warp drive either!
 PICARD / Data, do we have any propulsion system that is functional?
 DATA / No, sir. Apparently we do not.
 RIKER / Just like the Brattain.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44639.9. We have now been adrift for a total of ten days. We have sent sub-space distress calls, but because of our distant location, we cannot expect a response for at least another two weeks.
 DATA / After analyzing the sensor logs from the Brattain and the Enterprise, as well as the data from our last series of probes, I have concluded that...
 DATA / (continuing) ... we have become trapped in a massive rupture in space... undetectable by normal means... into which energy is absorbed.
 PICARD / You mean... a Tyken's Rift...
 BEVERLY / A what?
 DATA / A rare anomaly named for Bela Tyken, the Melthusian Captain who first encountered it.
 GEORDI / A Tyken's Rift -- of course... that would explain why we don't have engine power.
 DATA / (acknowledges) The ship's energy is being drained into the fissure before we can utilize it.
 WORF / (tight-lipped) I was detained.
 DATA / When Tyken was trapped in a Rift, his analysis determined that a massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly. Fortunately, his cargo included anicium and yurium, which he used to detonate a massive explosion. He then escaped through the ruptured center of the Rift.
 GEORDI / (acknowledges) But we aren't carrying anything that could produce that kind of explosion. Even our photon torpedoes wouldn't be enough.
 RIKER / Can't we replicate the elements Tyken used?
 DATA / We no longer have the power to reproduce complex elements with our replicators. We must find a way to generate a violent energy release without relying on conventional means.
 BEVERLY / Data... in Tyken's experience... did the crew exhibit behavioral changes?
 DATA / No. There were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew.
 TROI / What about nightmares?
 DATA / There was no record of sleep distubances of any kind, Counselor.
 BEVERLY / Then -- what is it? What's happening to us?
 RIKER / So far, the only one who doesn't seem affected by all this is Data... (beat) Bridge.
 PICARD / Number One... how... are you?
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / Any hallucinations? Nightmares?
 RIKER / No... but I'd be a liar if I said I felt like myself... I bite my tongue to keep from snapping at people... and a couple of times, when I've gone into my quarters... (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (beat; this is hard for him) ... I've felt as though... there's someone in there... waiting for me...
 PICARD / It's affecting all of us. I've -- had similar feelings...
 PICARD / With everyone around us succumbing... it's even more important that at least one of us stay in control of his faculties. I want you to turn in... take a nap. I'll be on the Bridge and you can relieve me in four hours.
 RIKER / All right, sir. Deck Eight.
 PICARD / No! No!
 PICARD / No... stop... no...
 WORF / Sir... ?
 PICARD / As you were.
 PICARD / Mister Data... in my Ready Room, please...
 DATA / Sir, Commander La Forge and I have come up with a potential solution to our predicament. Perhaps the modifications we used to increase firepower against the Borg might be effective here.
 PICARD / Channeling power into the main deflector dish...
 DATA / I believe within six hours we can generate a concentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the Tyken's Rift.
 PICARD / Very well. Proceed.
 PICARD / Mister Data...
 DATA / (turning back) Sir?
 PICARD / Apparently... I am not immune... to the strange forces at work on this ship...
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / It's a frightening prospect... to lose control of your mind... (beat) When I was young, I saw my grandfather deteriorate... from a powerful, robust figure... to a -- a frail wisp of a man, who couldn't even remember how to make his way home...
 PICARD / It is my responsibility... somehow... to see that this ship is guided to safety. I will have to rely on you, from now on... (beat) We may need to count on you for our very survival.
 DATA / Yes, sir. I will do my best.
 BEVERLY / I want to do more cross-sections on the brain tissue of some of these bodies. Set up the positron emission sensors in Sickbay... I'll decide which ones I want to study.
 BEVERLY / Go away.
 BEVERLY / Captain, let me ask you this: since we located the Brattain... can you remember any of your dreams?
 PICARD / I hardly ever remember dreams...
 BEVERLY / A lot of people don't... but think... have you had a dream in the last ten days?
 PICARD / (struggles with it) I... don't recall...
 BEVERLY / I'm betting you haven't. What's more, neither has anyone else on board this ship -- except Troi. I began to realize it when she talked about her nightmares.
 BEVERLY / I've done additional brain tissue tests on some of the bodies from the... the...
 DATA / The Brattain...
 BEVERLY / ... and scans on a random cross-section of our crew. They all show the same result... a unique chemical imbalance.
 PICARD / Caused by -- ?
 BEVERLY / Dream deprivation.
 BEVERLY / Every night... we... we enter into... sleep...
 DATA / I believe the Doctor means to say that humans enter what is known as REM sleep... rapid eye movement. It is the level of brain-wave activity at which you dream.
 BEVERLY / We need dreams to survive... if we don't get REM sleep, we don't dream, and we begin to lose our -- cognitive abilities... it becomes hard to concentrate... we forget... how to do the most ordinary task.
 BEVERLY / Then... we become irritable... paranoid... some people experience hallucinations...
 PICARD / You're describing the situation on this ship... But Counselor Troi has reported nightmares...
 BEVERLY / Maybe it's because she's Betazoid. I don't know... but there's something more going on here than being stuck in a Tyken's Rift... and I don't know how or why it's happening...
 BEVERLY / But I do know this. There is an inevitable conclusion to this pattern. If I can't find a way to reverse it -- we are all going to go insane.
 TROI / Where are you... ?
 TROI (V.O.) / I'm still here... I haven't gone anywhere...
 TROI (V.O.) / Do you remember anything more?
 TROI (V.O.) / What does that mean? Is something doubled?
 BEVERLY / Deanna... Nothing's working... I've tried somatic drugs, I've tried inducing theta waves in the entorhinal cortex... no matter what I do, no one can reach REM sleep. No one can dream... except you...
 TROI / (ironic) Except me... And all I have is nightmares... I can barely sleep at all anymore.
 TROI / In the end... I'll be like him. Just like him.
 GEORDI / Okay... all power has been channelled to the... the...
 GEORDI / I can't remember what it's called.
 DATA / The main deflector dish...
 GEORDI / Yes... so, now what do we do?
 DATA / We must coordinate our effort with the Bridge.
 DATA / Data to Bridge...
 PICARD / Yes...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / We are ready to discharge the main deflector, Captain.
 PICARD / All right...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Mister Worf -- activate the deflector.
 GEORDI / Deflector power coils charging...
 GEORDI / Peeples...
 DATA / (touches com) Security to Engineering.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Deflector powerbanks approaching maximum. Discharge in fifteen seconds.
 DATA / Confine Ensign Peeples to Sickbay.
 GEORDI / Data... this detonation better work... we aren't gonna last much longer...
 WORF / Discharge in three seconds... two... one...
 RIKER / Nothing... it just fizzled out...
 DATA / The energy output was absorbed into the Rift.
 PICARD / Data... can we try again?
 DATA / No, sir. If we draw more power, we risk losing life-support systems.
 WORF / lujpu' jiH'e, Alexandrijn.
 TROI / Worf, no!
 WORF / You will not stop me...
 TROI / Security to Lieutenant Worf's quarters, immediately...
 WORF / No one will stop me...
 TROI / Why, Worf? What is it?
 WORF / I am no longer a warrior... I am no longer strong... I feel...
 TROI / What is it you feel?
 WORF / I feel... fear.
 TROI / Worf... to admit that you are afraid... gives you strength.
 WORF / Something is waiting for us... I am not strong enough to fight it...
 TROI / No, Worf. It is just an illusion. It is not real. (beat) Please... put down the knife.
 TROI / It's all right. Everything is fine. Thank you.
 TROI / Let me take you to Sickbay.
 DATA (V.O.) / Acting Captain's log, stardate 44642.1. I have assumed command of the Enterprise at the request of Captain Picard. Our situation is deteriorating; many of the crew are unable to function and our life support systems are beginning to falter.
 TROI (V.O.) / Once before... you said "double"... what did you mean? What is double?
 TROI (V.O.) / ... what do you mean... you can't leave?
 TROI (V.O.) / You want to leave? Why can't you?
 TROI / (aloud) Eyes in the dark... that's what the voice said in my dream.
 TROI / Is that where you heard it? In a dream? Over and over... ?
 TROI / Beverly... I know what it is... I know what's happening...
 BEVERLY / What... ?
 TROI / My nightmare... it's not a dream. It's not a dream at all... it's a message.
 TROI / REM sleep occurs at a different frequency for Betazoids than other humanoids... I believe these beings are using that frequency to communicate telepathically...
 DATA / It is conceivable that this telepathic communication is creating an interference that prevents REM sleep in other species -- that would be an explanation for why the rest of the crew is not dreaming.
 PICARD / Counselor... what are these -- beings -- trying to tell us?
 TROI / They're calling for help. I think they're trapped just like we are. "Eyes in the dark"... could mean this twin star system...
 DATA / Your hypothesis is certainly plausible.
 DATA / It may well be that there is another ship... on the other side of the fissure... where we cannot detect it.
 BEVERLY / Is there any way... to block their signals?
 DATA / We have no technology to block telepathic transmissions, Doctor.
 TROI / Maybe... communication through dreams can work both ways... I could try to get them to stop...
 DATA / Perhaps we can accomplish more than that. If we could coordinate our efforts with these beings... we might work together to free ourselves.
 TROI / It is conceivable... in working with patients who have debilitating nightmares, I have often used a therapetuic treament known as "directed dreaming"...
 TROI / Dreamers can learn to take control of their dreams... retain a conscious memory... even while they're in REM sleep. I should be able to remember a short message.
 PICARD / If it's... possible... what would you say... ?
 DATA / What we must discover is a means by which, working together with the aliens, we can produce an explosion more intense than either of us could achieve alone.
 TROI / What is it you're looking for?
 DATA / These are the elements we have available. Some of them could be used in the creation of an explosive reaction. If we can communicate this inventory to the other ship, perhaps they will be able to --
 TROI / No, Data... that's too complex. This has to be a simple, clear message...
 DATA / I am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate...
 TROI / Stop... go back...
 TROI (O.C.) / Further back... there. Stop.
 TROI / "One... moon... circles... "
 DATA / (curious) Yes, Counselor, one electron circles one proton... this is a hydrogen atom.
 TROI / "One moon circles"... that's what they have been telling me... over and over...
 DATA / Perhaps the aliens are thinking as we are... to collaborate in producing an explosion. If hydrogen is combined with certain elements... calendenium, for example, it is extremely volatile. (beat) But... would the message mean they have hydrogen... or want hydrogen?
 TROI / If it is a distress call, they'd be asking for what they need... not what they already have.
 DATA / Then a proper course of action would be for us to release hydrogen into the Rift and hope that they have a substance which could detonate it.
 TROI / How do I tell them what to do?
 DATA / If you are correct, Counselor, I believe they have already told us what to do... and are waiting for us to do it. When we are ready the only message you should try to convey is, "Now!"
 BEVERLY / I can help keep you in REM sleep for a while with this cortical scanner... it will maintain electrical activity in your brain at the proper frequencies...
 DATA / Counselor. You will have to communicate with the other ship within two minutes of entering REM sleep.
 TROI / (reacts) Two minutes, is that all, Data?
 DATA / Unfortunately, yes. We have only enough power to emit a hydrogen stream for that period of time. They must understand that they have to detonate it immediately. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (to Picard) Sir, we are ready to implement the plan.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 DATA / We will need to draw power from the life support systems in order to discharge the collectors. (a beat, Picard doesn't respond, so Data activates a companel) This is Acting Captain Data. All personnel will report to designated shelter areas immediately...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / ... life support systems will continue only in emergency shelter areas...
 BEVERLY / PGO signals steady... visual cortex is showing increased activity... rapid eye movements commencing...
 BEVERLY / Crusher to Bridge... she's in REM sleep...
 DATA / Thank you, Doctor. (to Picard) Activating the Bussard collectors.
 TROI / Where are you?
 DATA / We have ninety seconds remaining.
 TROI / Where are you... ?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / How is she, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (touches com) Still in REM sleep...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / And how are you?
 BEVERLY / ...I'm... fine...
 TROI / Where are you? I have to find you... I have to tell you...
 DATA / Forty-five seconds remaining.
 TROI / Please... I must find you... tell you...
 DATA / Thirty seconds...
 DATA / Ten seconds.
 PICARD / Nothing... no explosion...
 DATA / The Counselor was unsuccessful.
 PICARD / Activate impulse engines...
 DATA / Engines activated, sir...
 DATA / We have cleared the rift, sir. Warp engines are coming back on line.
 PICARD / Set a course...
 DATA / Setting a course for Starbase Two-twenty. Sir, as my final duty as Acting Captain, I order you to bed. I shall do the same for all personnel.
 PICARD / Very well, Mister Data...
 PICARD / And... thank you.
 DATA / Yes, sir. Pleasant dreams.
 GEORDI moves into view, holding a Tricorder. (Note: / Geordi is younger here, wearing a slightly different, earlier version of his VISOR.)
 GEORDI / (baffled) I've checked buildings Four and Five... they're like all the others... no phaser hits, no sign of a fight. Looks like the entire outpost just... vanished...
 PICARD / Commander Leijten, you said Brevelle was ill last week for several days before he... deserted. What about Mendez?
 RIKER / And Hickman?
 GEORDI / (skeptical) I know Paul Hickman. He's a family man... two kids. I can't believe he'd steal a shuttle and desert...
 PICARD / The original Tarchannen disapperances were never solved, were they?
 RIKER / And now, five years later, members of the away team that investigated the disappearances... have started disappearing themselves.
 PICARD (V.O) / Captain's log, Stardate 44664.5. We have set a course to intercept Lieutenant Hickman's stolen shuttlecraft... and, hopefully, to discover the whereabouts of the other missing officers...
 GEORDI / Bogrow... which one was he?
 GEORDI / (remembering) Not Bogrow...
 GEORDI / The one who used to drive you crazy... you thought he was so full of himself...
 GEORDI / Uh huh...
 GEORDI / (laughs, shakes his head) Bogrow...
 GEORDI / I enjoy the bachelor's life too much...
 GEORDI / Well, you were obviously a great advisor...
 GEORDI / What do you think, Suz?
 GEORDI / Yeah, I know.
 GEORDI / A helluva team...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Commander La Forge, Commander Leijten, report to the Bridge. We have a fix on the missing shuttle.
 GEORDI / (keying insignia) On our way, Commander.
 PICARD / Slow to impulse power. Mister Worf?
 WORF / Long range sensors holding on the shuttlecraft... bearing zero one zero, mark two seven one.
 PICARD / Hail the vessel.
 WORF / Lieutenant Hickman is not responding, sir.
 PICARD / Put a repeating message on all sub-space channels. Make it a Priority One communique -- order the Lieutenant to come about and stand to.
 WORF / Still no response, sir.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / The shuttle's acceleration is increasing... its trajectory is moving directly into the planet's atmosphere.
 DATA / He will reach an atmospheric interface at an altitude of two hundred and ten kilometers.
 RIKER / At his current speed, he'll self-destruct.
 DATA / That is correct, Commander.
 PICARD / How soon, Data?
 DATA / (checking panels) Fifty-three seconds.
 PICARD / Options?
 GEORDI / And he's too far away for a positive lock with the tractor beam.
 PICARD / (quickly, to Worf) Open a channel.
 WORF / Open.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Hickman, listen carefully. I am Captain Picard of the Enterprise. You are in danger. You must slow your rate of approach.
 DATA / (reacting to console) The shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere, Captain.
 RIKER / He's panicking...
 DATA / At current rate of acceleration, the shuttlecraft will be destroyed in twenty-eight seconds.
 DATA / Sixteen seconds to impact.
 PICARD / (to com) Lieutenant Hickman, you must do as I tell you. Reduce your velocity and bring your craft to a positive pitch of twenty degrees... now.
 DATA / The shuttle is entering the lower ionosphere...
 WORF / Sir, sensors detect two more Federation shuttlecraft on the planet's surface... no life signs.
 PICARD / Ready an away team, Number One.
 RIKER / Geordi, Data, Worf...
 RIKER / (continuing) And Commander Leijten.
 RIKER / Commander Leijten, La Forge, check the shuttle... Worf, Data, you've got the perimeter.
 DATA / No life signs, sir.
 WORF / (low) Sir... I am certain that we are being watched.
 GEORDI / Commander Riker...
 GEORDI / Where's Commander Leijten?
 RIKER / (keys insignia) Susanna, report.
 RIKER / Fan out. Let's find her.
 GEORDI / (calls out) Susanna?
 GEORDI / (keys communicator) La Forge to Leijten...
 GEORDI / Where have you been?
 GEORDI / Yes... but they're not human...
 GEORDI / I'm not picking up anything...
 GEORDI / Where are you going?
 GEORDI / Susanna... ?
 GEORDI / (hits communicator) La Forge to Enterprise, medical emergency, two to Sickbay.
 GEORDI / You look fine... now.
 BEVERLY / Your blood chemistry is way off. And you had a histamine response, to what I don't know. (a beat) I'll run a complete blood and tissue analysis.
 BEVERLY / Uh uh... until we find some answers, I don't want you to leave the Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / (interrupting) Look, Commander, you may simply have had an anxiety reaction down there. But we've got to make sure.
 GEORDI / (to Susanna's look) Probably wouldn't hurt to take it easy for a while...
 PICARD / Your devotion to duty is admirable, Commander... but Doctor Crusher is right. You will remain on the Enterprise until we know whether or not this is connected to the disappearance of the others.
 PICARD / (firm) We have completed our survey on the surface. Analyzing that data will keep all of us busy for some time.
 GEORDI / (gently stepping in) Data has a preliminary report... if you feel up to it...
 PICARD / Doctor... what about La Forge?
 BEVERLY / I gave him a complete bioscan. Everything says he's in perfect shape.
 PICARD / But according to all reports... so were Mendez and Hickman before they disappeared.
 GEORDI / (a warning) Susanna...
 GEORDI / Suz... I'm here... (a beat, a smile) I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 GEORDI / Main Bridge.
 DATA / During microscopic examination of the torn uniform, I discovered these alien skin cells.
 DATA / Undetermined.
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) Without something else to cross-reference, it would take weeks to try and identify them...
 DATA / Fortunately, there is more evidence...
 DATA / We have been able to determine that the footprints we found by the shuttle were not made by any known Tarchannen life form.
 DATA / The planet is subject to frequent sandstorms. Footprints could have been obliterated prior to your arrival.
 DATA / Doctor Crusher and I will begin to search the medical database... and attempt to match these with a known life form.
 GEORDI / Some kind of compulsion... like a post hypnotic command... ?
 GEORDI / We can go back to the mission record... construct a log of everyone's movements...
 GEORDI / Or something we ingested... could be in the air itself...
 BEVERLY / (not hopeful) The parameters are pretty broad, Data... any match we make is going to be inconclusive at best.
 DATA / I am aware of that. However, I see no other reasonable course of investigation available to us. (beat) And we may not have much time.
 BEVERLY / You're worried about Geordi, aren't you?
 DATA / (reminding her) I am an android. It is not possible for me to feel anxiety. Starfleet personnel have vanished... others may be at risk. We must do the best we can to find out why.
 DATA / However...
 DATA / I am strongly motivated to solve this mystery.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Freeze visual.
 GEORDI / (surprised) You didn't feel that way before... it was your idea to look for some sort of commonality.
 GEORDI / That's not an option... not until the Captain says it is...
 GEORDI / Computer resume.
 GEORDI / Take a break. I'll work for a...
 GEORDI / (gently) I think... we should go see Doctor Crusher...
 GEORDI / Susanna... you can't leave...
 GEORDI / Susanna...
 GEORDI / SUSANNA!
 BEVERLY / (tense) Her blood pressure's still falling... (to the Nurse) Apply the T-cell stimulator. We've got to stabilize her immune system.
 BEVERLY / She's developed an extreme sensitivity to light... we're trying to make her more comfortable.
 GEORDI / My God...
 GEORDI / Hold on, Susanna. Doctor Crusher will help you. Just... hold on.
 GEORDI / Don't give up... do you hear me, Suz? You can't give up...
 BEVERLY / This is one of Susanna's altered skin cells...
 BEVERLY / And this is one of the alien cells Data found.
 PICARD / Almost identical. How do you explain it?
 BEVERLY / Captain, I think the people who disappeared from Tarchannen Three weren't abducted... they were transformed into another species...
 GEORDI / (even) Can you stop it, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (not hopeful) The T-cell stimulator will slow the rate of change... but until I find the cause...
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher... is this a threat to the Enterprise?
 BEVERLY / No. I've tested the cell wall integrity. It's viability is extremely low. It's not possible for Susanna to transmit it.
 GEORDI / Then how did she get it?
 BEVERLY / That's a good question. And it would be a great help if I knew. (turning to Geordi) The only thing I do know, Geordi... is that it's very possible you'll be next.
 GEORDI / I had two full bioscans today. You said I was fine.
 BEVERLY / I gave Susanna a bioscan, too. I didn't find anything wrong with her, either.
 GEORDI / How long?
 BEVERLY / I don't know what we're dealing with. Brevelle was sick for days before he left... Mendez was normal an hour before she disappeared. You may have weeks... or just a few hours.
 GEORDI / (after a thoughtful beat) Then there's no time to waste. I've got to get back to work.
 BEVERLY / Geordi... until I know exactly what we're dealing with, you're staying here. In Sickbay.
 GEORDI / Doctor, you said it would help if you knew the source of this... (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / If I could finish my analysis of the mission records... I might find an answer.
 PICARD / (stepping in) And what if you begin to change... and feel compelled to return to the planet like the others?
 GEORDI / Program the computer to monitor my movements... that way you can be sure I don't leave the ship.
 GEORDI / What would you do, sir? Sit it out in Sickbay... or try to learn what it is that's got you... and maybe stop it?
 PICARD / All right, Mister La Forge... proceed with your investigation. But report to Doctor Crusher for another bioscan at the start of day watch.
 BEVERLY / In the meantime, if you have symptoms of any kind -- I want to know. Immediately.
 GEORDI / Understood.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Okay, computer...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Analyze audio elements from time index fourteen four seven to fifteen five eight. List all anomalies.
 GEORDI / Any subspace projections... z particle emissions... or interferometric frequencies?
 DATA / Geordi... may I inquire how your investigation is proceeding?
 GEORDI / It's not.
 DATA / Have you done an audio analysis...
 GEORDI / And a spectrographic analysis and a screen for ionizing radiation... and I even ran an enhancement for micro-seismic disturbances. I've tried it all.
 GEORDI / I'm sorry, Data.
 DATA / There is no need for an apology.
 DATA / Perhaps if you indulged in a short rest period, you could approach this problem with what humans commonly refer to as a fresh point of view...
 GEORDI / You're probably right, Data. But I've got to finish scanning these records... while I can.
 DATA / Is there some way I can assist you?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) If I knew what I was looking for... (sighs) I think it's just down to going over it, Data... maybe find something I forgot... I'll let you know if I come up with anything... anything at all.
 BEVERLY / It's alright. What's happened?
 BEVERLY / (what the hell) Her skin's simulating the light... a radiant reaction... (musing) Some sort of mimetic ability?
 BEVERLY / (puzzled) It's as if she's generating a disruptive field... I can barely get readings off her now... What about her rate of transformation?
 BEVERLY / That's not possible. It should have been inhibited by the T-cell stimulator... unless... (thinking hard) If there's a foreign body inside her that's producing these changes... something like a viral creche...
 BEVERLY / (let's get to it) I want a full genetic analysis. We're going to examine any abnormality we find... no matter how insignificant it seems.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Computer, delete the audio.
 GEORDI / Wait a minute... freeze visual.
 GEORDI / (after a beat, puzzled) Whose shadow is that?
 GEORDI / Computer... the shadow currently displayed in section B-eleven... what is its source?
 GEORDI / It's gotta belong to somebody... (to viewer) Computer... return to time index fourteen five eight...
 GEORDI / Okay... Brevelle's behind the camera... Susanna and I head off in that direction. Mendez moves off that way... (softly) ... so whose shadow is it?
 GEORDI / Computer... replay visual from last time index. No audio. Slow to fifty percent.
 GEORDI / Freeze visual.
 GEORDI / Magnify four times... apply spectral enhancement.
 GEORDI / (urgent) Computer, do you have sufficient data to compile a Holographic simulation of this Visual Record?
 GEORDI / Good. Fine. Scan the entire record... then recreate it in Holodeck Three.
 GEORDI / Computer, is the Tarchannen simulation ready?
 GEORDI / Computer, scan Starfleet records and create a simulation of Brevelle... place him where he stood while recording this...
 GEORDI / Good. Computer, based on their speed and direction, can you extrapolate each officer's movements as they walk out of the recording device's field of view?
 GEORDI / Understood. Run simulation.
 GEORDI / It's happening too fast. (a beat) Freeze program.
 GEORDI / Computer, reverse simulation... run it back to... time index fourteen five eight.
 GEORDI / Freeze.
 GEORDI / Computer... remove Leijten...
 GEORDI / Remove La Forge...
 GEORDI / ... and now remove Mendez...
 GEORDI / Computer, using vector analysis, identify the source of this shadow.
 GEORDI / There must be something else here... something between the camera lights and the wall.
 GEORDI / Computer, given the distance from the lights to the wall... can you determine the most likely shape and position of the object casting this shadow?
 GEORDI / Okay... let's assume the height of our friend here is about my size... say one hundred seventy centimeters... now can you extrapolate its shape and position?
 GEORDI / Do it.
 BEVERLY / (at last) There... in the thymus...
 BEVERLY / (studying the figures, puzzled) Some kind of parasite. It's using Susanna's immune system to spread genetic instructions...
 BEVERLY / She could have been infected during the original mission. It's small enough to have entered through any of the mucous membranes...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) But it certainly isn't acting like a typical parasite... it's not feeding off her -- it's actually transforming her DNA to match its own...
 BEVERLY / (acknowledges, urgent) And we're going to need unaltered genes... or we'll never get her back. We've got to get that thing out of her. Now.
 RIKER / Any luck?
 DATA / Negative, Commander. Nothing in our survey suggests the source of a parasitic infection...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Bridge.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / The surgery was successful...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) ... but it will be a few hours before we know how her regenerative systems are responding... In the meantime, I'd better get Geordi in here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Very good, Doctor. Keep us advised.
 BEVERLY / (keying insignia) Crusher to La Forge...
 BEVERLY / Computer, locate Commander La Forge.
 BEVERLY / Bridge, the Computer says Geordi isn't on board... ? Is that correct?
 DATA / I show no transporter activity.
 WORF / All shuttles are secure.
 RIKER / Negative, Doctor. There is no indication he left the ship.
 PICARD / Computer, what was Commander La Forge's last known location?
 RIKER / Worf...
 BEVERLY / Captain, if Geordi has transformed, he may be virtually a chameleon -- the skin develops mimetic capabilities... he could still be onboard...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / ... but undetectable to our sensors...
 WORF / (to guard) Search the structure... I will take the perimeter...
 WORF (O.S.) / Commander...
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF HEDRICK is at his station, running / a routine maintenance program. The door opens and he reacts to...
 DATA / Captain... the security lockout on Transporter Room Six has been broken.
 PICARD / Re-engage... now.
 DATA / I cannot, sir... The transport cycle has already begun.
 WORF / I do not read any life signs on the surface.
 PICARD / Our sensor array is useless... we have to find another way of locating him.
 DATA / Captain, if we can get close enough to Geordi... we can read his absorption spectrum with an ultraviolet light.
 RIKER / Can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on UV?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Make it so. Number One, as soon as Data is ready, I want you to lead an away team.
 RIKER / How long, Mister Data?
 DATA / (continuing to work as he talks) I still must replace the emitter module and reconnect the power supply. It will take approximately two minutes to complete the modification.
 RIKER / (keying insignia) Go ahead.
 RIKER / Acknowledged.
 RIKER / He's on foot... couldn't have gotten far by now. Let's assume a radius of ten kilometers...
 WORF / That is still a search area of more than three hundred square kilometers.
 RIKER / We've got to narrow it down. What's happening with the enhanced sensor arrays?
 WORF / All scans are still negative.
 RIKER / There has to be some way to track him. (new thought) What about the high resolution EM scans?
 WORF / We are adjusting the sensors to read Commander La Forge's absorption spectrum... but it will take several hours.
 RIKER / (beat) Geordi doesn't have several hours.
 DATA / I have completed the modifications, Commander.
 RIKER / (keying insignia) Doctor Crusher... meet us in Transporter Room Six. Immediately.
 BEVERLY / (to Ogawa) ... And I'm going to need a sedative for him... Get me ten cc's of kayolane...
 BEVERLY / You look a lot better than you did an hour ago...
 BEVERLY / We removed some kind of parasite from your thymus...
 BEVERLY / Yes...
 BEVERLY / Don't try to get up yet...
 BEVERLY / An away team is about to start a search.
 RIKER / (to Susanna; re: the emergency beacon) What about the ultraviolet?
 WORF / He could be several kilometers away by now.
 BEVERLY / Geordi...
 BEVERLY / (taps insignia) Crusher to Enterprise. Lock on to Commander Leitjen's signal... prepare to transport two directly to Sickbay.
 PICARD / Is there no hope for the others? Brevelle, Mendez...
 GEORDI / (slight panic) Susanna...
 GEORDI / (weakly) Lieutenant Commander La Forge reporting for duty, Captain.
 PICARD / Welcome back, Mister La Forge.
 BEVERLY / (to Susanna) This species... can we communicate with them?
 GEORDI / No. They act on instinct alone. (beat) In another few minutes, I wouldn't have responded to you at all, Susanna.
 PICARD / Then we shall leave them be. I'll order warning beacons placed in orbit and on the surface. Hopefully, no one else will have to go through what you did.
 GEORDI / Down there, I didn't know who you were... and yet somehow I believed you... trusted you...
 GEORDI / Thank you.
 BEVERLY / -- You were like a brother to me. We played in the park near the lake.
 BEVERLY / You used to make swords out of the reeds -- And when you cut your hand, you would run to me, and I would say -- (taking his hand) "Let me see --"
 BEVERLY / Oh! How did you do that?
 BEVERLY / And how many were against you?
 BEVERLY / Tell me!
 BEVERLY / (still holding his hand) I do dare... I love someone.
 BEVERLY / But he does not know.
 BEVERLY / Not yet. He is proud, noble, brave and beautiful --
 BEVERLY / What's the matter?
 BEVERLY / Since this morning. Baron Christien de Neuvillette. In your own regiment.
 BEVERLY / Promise to be his friend.
 BEVERLY / And never let him fight a duel.
 BEVERLY / Oh, I love you. (standing) I must go now. You never told me what happened last night. And tell him to write me. A hundred men against one. To write, remember. A hundred men! What courage!
 RIKER, DATA, GEORDI, TROI, WORF, and a few / supernumeraries still clapping.
 RIKER / Bravo.
 TROI / Wonderful.
 DATA / (to Riker) Lieutenant Barclay's performance was superficially adequate but clearly not rooted in The Method approach. As a result, his customary anxiety was evident. I do not understand why...
 RIKER / (still clapping) -- Because it's polite, Data.
 GEORDI / (re: Barclay) Not a bad showing after only six weeks of lessons.
 BEVERLY / Not a bad showing period.
 BEVERLY / There's an opening in my workshop... Worf.
 TROI / Well done.
 TROI / You've come a long way, Reg.
 TROI / I don't just mean your acting ability. It takes a great deal of courage to put yourself on display like that.
 TROI / (acknowledges) There was a time when nothing could have dragged you onto a stage in front of an audience. You've made tremendous progress.
 TROI / Don't you think so?
 TROI / I disagree. This isn't fantasy -- it's theatre. You used to withdraw into the holodeck. You isolated yourself inside your own imagination, avoiding contact with real people.
 TROI / (continuing) Look at yourself now... and look at all the other people you're with... you're not just acting, you're inter-acting. Give yourself some credit, Mister Barclay!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44704.2. We have arrived at the Argus Array, the remote subspace telescope at the very edge of Federation space. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / The unmanned structure mysteriously stopped relaying its data nearly two months ago.
 PICARD, Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and ENSIGN APRIL / ANAYA.
 DATA / The fusion reactors that power the array are extremely unstable. The risk of overload is high.
 RIKER / What about the computer systems?
 DATA / (testing panels) They do not seem to be functioning at all.
 WORF / (off instruments) Captain! I am picking up an unidentified device! One point eight kilometers from the array!
 PICARD / Onscreen.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / Some kind of probe. I'll bet that's what damaged the array.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Is it emitting any signals, Lieutenant?
 WORF / Negative, sir. I show no activity.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, why don't you go out and take a closer look.
 GEORDI / (exiting) Aye, sir. (to Com) Mister Barclay, report to Main Shuttlebay.
 GEORDI / Enterprise, this is Shuttle Five, in position. Ready to begin short-range scan.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Proceed, Shuttle Five.
 GEORDI / (to Barclay) Let's start with the passive high res series.
 GEORDI / Give it a try.
 GEORDI / Try the neutron densitometer.
 GEORDI / Hmmmm. Doesn't seem to want to give up any secrets. Let's go to active scan.
 GEORDI / (to probe) You are definitely not from our neighborhood. (to Barclay) Increase to three point zero.
 GEORDI / Yeah, Reg?
 GEORDI / Don't mention it. You're one of my top engineers. It's about time you started to do the interesting stuff. (re: situation) This is why I'm in Starfleet.
 GEORDI / Hit it with the positron emission.
 GEORDI / (continuing) What was that? (looking at instruments) Our computer is down!
 GEORDI / Reg! Reg!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. An intense energy surge from the alien probe has severly disabled the shuttle's onboard computer. The away team has been transported directly to Sickbay.
 RIKER / Any indication of the probe's energy source, Data?
 DATA / No sir. Power emissions do not match any known radiation patterns. We have not encountered this technology before.
 PICARD / Very well. Isolate the probe and place it in tow. We'll take it to Science Station Four-Oh-Two in the Kohlan system...
 WORF / (interrupting) Captain. The probe has begun to move. It is approaching the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Shields up!
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / (to Barclay) There was enough energy in that flash to overload your optic nerves. It knocked you unconscious.
 GEORDI / My VISOR must have filtered it out.
 BEVERLY / Exactly. (to Barclay) Well, there's no apparent retinal damage and the cornea looks fine. But I'm still waiting for the full sero-amino readout. I'll call you when it comes in.
 BEVERLY / What do you mean?
 BEVERLY / That's not possible. (a smile) These are human cells we're talking about, not isolinear circuits. (kiddingly) You'd better stick to engineering.
 WORF / Probe now closing at fifteen point three meters per second. Collision course.
 DATA / Captain, sensors are reading no particulate emissions or subspace field distortions.
 PICARD / Then how is it able to move?
 DATA / The method of propulsion is unknown.
 RIKER / Ensign, take us away from it. One quarter impulse.
 WORF / The probe is matching our speed and course.
 DATA / Captain, an energy field is forming around the device. Intensity is three point two terawatts, and increasing.
 WORF / Sir, the shuttlecraft shields did not provide sufficent protection for its computer. Our computer may also be vulnerable. I recommend withdrawal to a safe distance.
 PICARD / Ensign Anaya, full about, go to one-half impulse.
 WORF / The probe is following.
 PICARD / Options, Number One?
 RIKER / We can't use photon torpedoes. An explosion this close to the ship could cripple us.
 WORF / Sir, recommend full phasers.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 WORF / Firing phasers.
 WORF / No effect, Captain.
 DATA / (off instruments) The probe's field intensity is continuing to build... we are in danger, Captain...
 RIKER / (to COM) Riker to La Forge. Can you increase phaser power?
 GEORDI / (to COM) Attempting to now, Commander. (to Barclay) Isolate phasers eighty through one twenty and shunt all plasma...
 GEORDI / (to COM) Captain! Phasers are as hot as we can make them!
 PICARD / Mister Worf.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Nothing.
 PICARD / Go to warp two.
 WORF / The probe is still with us, sir.
 RIKER / At warp two?
 WORF / Yessir.
 DATA / Captain. The probe's energy output is overloading our shields. Failure anticipated in forty-seven seconds.
 PICARD / I'm willing to entertain suggestions...
 WORF / (interrupting) Captain! We're dropping to impulse.
 GEORDI / Barclay, what are you doing?
 RIKER / We're too close.
 PICARD / (to COM) La Forge?
 GEORDI / (to COM) I don't know how Barclay did it, but shield strength has been increased by over three hundred percent. It should be enough.
 PICARD / Mister Worf. Photon torpedos. Maximum yield, full spread.
 WORF / Aye.
 PICARD / (to Com) Thank you, Mister Barclay...
 GEORDI / Don't mention it...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44705.3. The Enterprise has destroyed the alien probe. But now we are left with the difficult task of repairing the Argus Telescope. Failure to do so would represent an irreplaceable scientific loss.
 RIKER (O.S.) / Mister Barclay.
 RIKER / (continuing) ... Everyone's still trying to figure out exactly how you did it.
 RIKER / Uh huh. (beat) Nice job.
 PICARD / Mister Barclay, I'm glad you could join us. (to Geordi) Your report, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Each of the telescope's subspace antenna clusters is powered by its own fusion reactor. But a single computer controls them all.
 RIKER / So, all eighteen reactors were affected when the computer was damaged... ?
 GEORDI / (nods) They're starting to overload, and could eventually go critical. If that happens, the explosion would destroy the Array. And I wouldn't want to be next door if that happens.
 DATA / A standard isolation procedure would be advisable.
 GEORDI / (nodding) I agree. We'll cut off each reactor from the damaged control system and repair them one by one.
 RIKER / How long will that take?
 GEORDI / Two, three weeks -- at least.
 PICARD / Alright then, Mister La Forge --
 PICARD / (reacts) Simultaneously? All eighteen?
 GEORDI / But the Argus computer is inoperable.
 DATA / That is an interesting suggestion, Lieutenant. However, such an approach would require more time than our original plan, at least seven weeks.
 RIKER / (incredulous) What?
 GEORDI / (awed) Sure, Reg.
 BEVERLY / (understatement) That was... a real improvement.
 BEVERLY / Same time...
 TROI / May I join you?
 TROI / Hard at work?
 TROI / I enjoyed the scene you just performed.
 TROI / Not at all. (a beat) I thought you were brilliant.
 TROI / You've... changed.
 TROI / Pure observation.
 TROI / I'm proud of you, Reg... and I'm glad for you, too.
 TROI / (stands) Well, I'd better be going.
 TROI / I... think so...
 TROI / Reg, as your former counselor... I... don't think it would be appropriate...
 TROI / (with a smile) Goodnight, Mister Barclay.
 GEORDI / Where's Lieutenant Barclay?
 GEORDI / Computer, location of Lieutenant Barclay.
 GEORDI / We had a meeting at Oh-seven hundred...
 GEORDI / What was that all about?
 GEORDI / A little? Most of the stuff on that blackboard was way out of my league. Yours too.
 GEORDI / -- Ever since our run-in with the probe, something's been different about you.
 GEORDI / (continuing) You just spent the entire night arguing Grand Unification Theories with Albert Einstein!
 GEORDI / -- Something's happened to you, Reg. We can't ignore that.
 GEORDI / (reluctantly) Yeah, I think we do...
 BEVERLY / Incredible. The production of neurotransmitters in your brain has jumped by over five hundred percent. Pre and postsynaptic membranes have increased their permeability to match it. (a beat) I couldn't even guess at an I.Q. level.
 BEVERLY / But that isn't all.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) The corpus callosum -- the connecting bridge between the two sides of the brain. It's so active that the hemispheres have essentially become one.
 GEORDI / So it's not just raw intelligence we're talking about.
 BEVERLY / Creativity, imagination, resourcefulness, inspiration -- it's all been enhanced.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Lieutenant, you are the most advanced human being who has ever lived.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log; supplemental. Apparently as a result of his exposure to the alien probe, Lieutenant Barclay has gained an extraordinary new level of intelligence. The question now is -- how are we to deal with it?
 RIKER / We could confine him to his quarters.
 GEORDI / How can we do that? What's he done? You're talking about locking him up for being too smart.
 RIKER / If he's under an alien influence, doesn't that put us all at risk?
 BEVERLY / Not necessarily. For all we know it could be more like a simple allergic reaction to a bee sting...
 PICARD / (a beat) Has Mister Barclay done anything that could be considered potentially threatening?
 TROI / He did make a pass at me last night.
 TROI / (continuing) A good one.
 GEORDI / I wouldn't exactly call that a threat.
 TROI / No, but it's definitely unusual behavior for Barclay.
 BEVERLY / (corroborating) He taught violin technique at the music school last night.
 RIKER / I didn't know Barclay even played the violin.
 BEVERLY / He didn't... until last night.
 GEORDI / Look... if we want to save the Array, we need Barclay... It's as simple as that...
 PICARD / Until he does something more menacing than what's been described -- I see no reason why we should prevent him from continuing his work.
 GEORDI / (to COM) Go ahead, Lieutenant.
 GEORDI / (to COM) I'll be right there.
 RIKER / You said he made a pass... you forgot to mention whether it was successful or not...
 GEORDI / Is the interface between our computer and the Array still in operation?
 GEORDI / We'll have to try a remote shutdown from here.
 GEORDI / What happened?
 GEORDI / Damn.
 GEORDI / (to COM) La Forge to Bridge. We're looking at a cascade reactor failure on the Argus.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I don't think we're gonna pull this one out.
 DATA / (off instruments) Reactor Nine will reach critical in ten minutes, forty three seconds. The subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction along the entire length of the Array.
 RIKER / (to COM) La Forge. You've got ten minutes.
 PICARD / (to Anaya) Ensign, standby for a jump to warp two.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, Red Alert.
 WORF / Aye, Commander.
 DATA / Argus Reactor Nine is twenty-eight seconds to critical.
 RIKER / Let's get out of here.
 PICARD / Warp two, Ensign.
 WORF / Captain! We have lost computer control!
 RIKER / What?
 DATA / Twelve seconds to critical, Sir...
 PICARD / (quickly to Anaya) Go to manual.
 RIKER / There's not enough time...
 WORF / The computer is coming back on line, sir.
 DATA / (puzzled; off instruments) Captain, the Argus reactors are shutting down. (to Picard) We are no longer in danger.
 PICARD / What happened?
 DATA / (checking) Unknown, sir...
 RIKER / La Forge, what did you do?
 GEORDI / Wasn't me, sir.
 PICARD / Computer, how were the Argus reactors shut down?
 RIKER / Barclay?
 PICARD / Computer! Respond.
 RIKER / Barclay?
 RIKER / Exactly what does that mean?
 PICARD / Mister Barclay, please remove yourself from the computer system and leave the holodeck.
 PICARD / Why is that?
 GEORDI / That's it.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I disconnected the visual and audio pickups. We can talk without being monitored by... (hesitates) the computer...
 WORF / By Barclay.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Report, Commander.
 GEORDI / It's now almost impossible to tell where Barclay ends and the computer begins. He's actually rewriting the isolinear chips each time he extends himself a little further.
 RIKER / How do we get him out of there?
 GEORDI / We don't. Not without killing him.
 PICARD / (beat) This is an intolerable situation... I have no wish to harm him, but we cannot allow Mister Barclay to continue to act as the ship's computer... I don't care how smart he is.
 DATA / Lieutenant Barclay has not yet extended himself into the Engineering subsystems. It may be possible to establish an ODN bypass directly to the Bridge.
 PICARD / That won't give us control of the ship.
 GEORDI / No... But we would have access to the propulsion systems. Enough to get us to the nearest Starbase.
 RIKER / How long would it take to set it up?
 GEORDI / A few hours.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 GEORDI / Should we... discuss this with Barclay, Captain?
 PICARD / I think not.
 GEORDI / Yeah, Reg?
 GEORDI / Just catching up on some work. (lying) That level-3 diagnostic we talked about. (beat) How're you doing?
 GEORDI / Give it a try.
 GEORDI / Understand?
 GEORDI / Do you understand how this happened to you?
 GEORDI / (concerned) Uh huh.
 GEORDI / I'll be honest with you. We don't know what to think.
 GEORDI / They will... ?
 WORF / Captain! I am picking up a subspace distortion.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / (off instruments) This disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton field emanating from our warp nacelles. It is creating a severe bias in the subspace continuum.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton field disturbance?
 PICARD / Mister Barclay, I'd like you to hold off on this experiment for now.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, this is a direct order. Discontinue whatever it is you're doing.
 WORF / Audio is disconnected. We may speak freely.
 RIKER / (to Data) How soon before the ODN bypass is in place?
 DATA / I have been monitoring Commander La Forge's progress. It will be operational in approximately seventeen minutes.
 TROI / (to Picard) Captain, let me go to the holodeck. Try to talk to him.
 WORF / (off instruments) Sir, the subspace distortion is continuing to increase...
 TROI / Reg...
 TROI / So am I. (beat) Reg, you've frightened everyone... I can't imagine that is your intent.
 TROI / Are we children to you, now?
 TROI / You've got it... From all of us. We don't need any more convincing. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / Please obey the Captain's orders... stop whatever you're doing...
 TROI / How are we to trust an officer who doesn't follow orders... ?
 TROI / The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to La Forge. Status?
 GEORDI / Ready now, Captain.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 GEORDI / Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / (startled) What.
 DATA / (surprised) Captain, the ODN bypass to the Bridge has been blocked. We have not regained control of the propulsion systems.
 RIKER / (to computer) Barclay!
 RIKER / (re: viewscreen) Shut that thing down!
 WORF / Captain. We are going in.
 PICARD / Mister Barclay! (beat) Respond at once!
 WORF / Audio is disconnected.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Lieutenant, take a security team to Holodeck Three. (beat) Disconnect Mister Barclay from the computer.
 WORF / (understanding implication) Aye, Captain.
 WORF / Phasers. Maximum setting
 WORF / The conduits.
 WORF / Fire.
 RIKER / (to Con) La Forge! Initiate stabilization procedure!
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Resetting stabilizers to match subspace flow matrix... stand by...
 PICARD / Mister Data... ?
 DATA / (off instruments) We are experiencing a quantum level oscillation delay... Doubling in intensity, every twelve point three seconds...
 WORF / (reporting) He is protected by a force field... we could not disconnect him.
 RIKER / Data, how long can we take this?
 DATA / Bio-cellular disruption is imminent.
 RIKER / Where are we, Ensign?
 PICARD / (awed) The center of the galaxy.
 DATA / (off instruments) Captain, all systems are back under helm control. The computer has resumed normal functioning.
 WORF / Captain!
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / Who are you?
 PICARD / Yes. I am interrogative... And I would appreciate an explanation...
 RIKER / Mister Barclay. I thought it would be fatal if you left the holodeck.
 PICARD / (to the alien) What do you want of us?
 PICARD / (explain) Mister Barclay... ?
 PICARD / Mission... ?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44721.9. The Cytherians have returned the Enterprise to Federation space. We bring back knowledge of their race that will take our scholars decades to examine. Lieutenant Barclay is apparently no worse for his experience.
 TROI / How much do you remember?
 TROI / And how do you feel now?
 GEORDI / Just plain old Barclay, huh...
 TROI / Most everyone has a moment in their lives when they exceed their own limits... achieve what seems to be impossible...
 GEORDI / The tricky part is what happens afterwards.
 TROI / (nodding) You almost always feel a sense of loss. But it's possible to carry something of that experience through the rest of your life -- in ways that you're not even aware of now.
 GEORDI / Either way, you're an important part of this crew. (rising) In fact, I could use your help tackling that level-3 diagnostic...
 TROI / Excuse me, Commander... but I believe Mister Barclay and I had a date scheduled for a walk in the Arboretum... ?
 GEORDI / The diagnostic can wait. See you later...
 TROI / (grins, takes his arm, leading him) I know.
 TROI / I didn't know you played chess.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, stardate 44741.9. We have arrived at Tagus Three where the Enterprise is to serve as host of the Federation Archeology Council's annual symposium.
 PICARD, intensely studying his monitor screen. / 
 PICARD (V.O.) / I look forward to giving tomorrow's keynote address with great anticipation.
 PICARD / Come.
 TROI ENTERS. Picard barely glances up from the / monitor. Troi smiles at Picard's preoccupation.
 TROI / I thought you'd want to know, Captain, the Council members have all been beamed aboard and assigned quarters.
 PICARD / Excellent.
 TROI / (a hint) It really is quite late, Captain.
 PICARD / Tell me, Counselor, in regard to my lecture, which do you suppose would provide greater clarity? A chronological structure, or a division of each excavation's findings into various sociological, religious, and environmental sub-groupings?
 TROI / I thought you had already decided on a chronological structure.
 PICARD / (nodding; but not quite convinced) Still, there is something to be said for a more scientific approach.
 TROI / Captain, may I make a suggestion?
 PICARD / By all means.
 TROI / Relax! You've written a brilliant speech.
 PICARD / It needs to be. Tomorrow I'll be addressing some of the greatest scientific minds in the Federation. Switzer, Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland. Giants in the field of Archeology. Next to them I'm nothing but an enthusiastic amateur.
 TROI / I doubt they think of you as an amateur... not when it comes to the ruins of Tagus Three.
 PICARD / (modestly) Well, I have done my homework... I've examined the findings of every archaeological expedition conducted on the planet's surface...
 TROI / It's unfortunate the Taguans no longer allow outsiders to visit the ruins.
 PICARD / (wistful) Indeed. Especially since we still know so little about their origin...
 PICARD / Hopefully, I've been able to construct some intriguing theories of my own.
 TROI / I'm sure the council members will agree that you have.
 PICARD / (smiling) Your support is appreciated, Deanna.
 PICARD / Screen off.
 PICARD / Vash? How did you get in here?
 PICARD / I had no idea you were a member of the Archaeology Council.
 PICARD / You are a member? (a beat) Aren't you.
 PICARD / Why have you come to Tagus Three?
 PICARD / Is that the only reason?
 PICARD / (smiling) I wish I could believe you?
 PICARD / Come.
 BEVERLY strides in. / 
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry I'm late... (noticing Vash) Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you had company.
 PICARD / That's quite all right, Doctor. Beverly Crusher allow me to introduce Vash. A friend of mine with the Archeology Council.
 BEVERLY / (to Vash) I didn't mean to interrupt. The Captain and I often share morning tea.
 BEVERLY / Really? When was that?
 BEVERLY / I see. (to Picard) That must have been during your vacation last year.
 PICARD / (giving nothing away) So it was.
 BEVERLY / (to Vash) I'm surprised he never mentioned you.
 BEVERLY / Not at the moment.
 BEVERLY / I'd be delighted to show it to you. If that's alright with you, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / Of course.
 BEVERLY / And this is Ten Forward, where the Council's welcoming reception is to be held this afternoon.
 BEVERLY / No, not often.
 BEVERLY / The Captain is a very private man.
 BEVERLY / Would you like something to drink?
 RIKER / Eternity never looked so lovely.
 RIKER / I was referring to the view. Eternity never looked so lovely.
 RIKER / (surprised) I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
 RIKER / (thinks he's figured it out) You're a Betazoid.
 RIKER / He does?
 BEVERLY / I see you two have met.
 RIKER / Not exactly.
 BEVERLY / Vash is a member of the Archeology Council. And a friend of the Captain.
 RIKER / So I've gathered.
 BEVERLY / They met during his visit to Risa.
 RIKER / On Risa? (amused) That must have been a better vacation than he let on.
 RIKER / Believe me, if he had, I would have remembered.
 BEVERLY / On my way. (to Vash) I'm afraid I won't be able to finish up our tour. (a beat) Perhaps Commander Riker could fill in for me.
 RIKER / It would be my pleasure.
 RIKER / That was me.
 RIKER / I wouldn't call it a very large collection.
 DATA and GEORDI at Science Station, WORF at Tactical. / N.D.'s elsewhere.
 RIKER / And that brings us to the Main Bridge, the Command center of the Enterprise, and the end of our tour.
 RIKER / Vash, I'd like you to meet Commander La Forge and Commander Data...
 RIKER / And this is Lieutenant Worf. (noticing Worf's scowl) Something wrong, Lieutenant?
 WORF / Sir, I was not informed that Council Members had been granted bridge clearance.
 RIKER / I think we can make an exception in this case, Mister Worf. Vash is the Captain's guest.
 WORF / (finally) Welcome aboard.
 RIKER / (pointing it out) That's the big chair.
 PICARD (V.O.) / I'm glad you approve.
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher was called to Sickbay.
 PICARD / So, did you enjoy your tour?
 PICARD / Good.
 PICARD / By all means. (a beat) Well, I suppose I'll see you then.
 RIKER / (watching her go) Fascinating woman.
 DATA / You find something humorous, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Didn't you notice how ill-at-ease the Captain seemed around Vash?
 DATA / Yes. However I see nothing amusing in his hostility toward her.
 GEORDI / That wasn't hostility, Data. (off Data's look) He likes her. (a beat) A lot.
 TROI / He does. When he feels it's necessary.
 TROI / Not that I can recall.
 TROI / You must understand, the Captain is a very...
 TROI & VASH / (together) Private man.
 TROI / Certainly.
 WORF / (still watching Vash) Nice legs. (off Geordi's look) For a human.
 PICARD / I agree, the Vulcan excavations on Tagus Three were extensive. Unfortunately, they were confined to the northeastern part of the city.
 PICARD / (to the Vulcan) Pardon me.
 PICARD / The reception seems to be a success.
 PICARD / What would you have me tell them?
 PICARD / I'm afraid that wasn't possible.
 PICARD / It would have been... inappropriate.
 PICARD / A Captain does not share his personal feelings with his crew.
 PICARD / I'm sorry if you're upset.
 RIKER / How was the reception?
 PICARD / (brusque) Splendid.
 PICARD / Get out of my chair.
 PICARD / We are not friends.
 PICARD / What brings you here, Q? Have you been banished from the Continuum once again?
 PICARD / Then what is it you want?
 PICARD / A debt?
 PICARD / I have no idea what you're talking about...
 PICARD / We all make mistakes.
 PICARD / Just be gone. That will suffice nicely.
 PICARD / Some other time, all right? Right now I have several things to attend to.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / They've been sealed off for over a century.
 PICARD / Impossible. That would mean breaking Taguan law.
 PICARD / I'm afraid my answer is still no. My lecture will have to stand on its own. Now, will you please leave my ship.
 PICARD / Completely.
 PICARD / (to Conn) Commander Riker, report to my Ready Room.
 RIKER / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / I've just been paid a visit by Q.
 RIKER / Q? (concerned) Any idea what he's up to?
 PICARD / He wants to do something nice for me.
 RIKER / I'll alert the crew.
 PICARD / It's me.
 PICARD / Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / May I come in?
 PICARD / To talk.
 PICARD / If it's all the same to you I'd rather this discussion not take place in a public corridor.
 PICARD / And I thought I was the only reason you came to Tagus.
 PICARD / Am I?
 PICARD / I'm afraid all this equipment will have to be confiscated.
 PICARD / I could have you placed in the brig.
 PICARD / If the Taguans were to catch you down there...
 PICARD / I remember.
 PICARD / Which you no doubt sold for a nice profit.
 PICARD / Not while you're aboard my ship. I will not allow it.
 PICARD / Nor can I change who I am.
 PICARD / So it would seem.
 GEORDI / What do you think it is?
 DATA / What do I think what is?
 GEORDI / About her. That, you know, gets to the Captain.
 DATA / Perhaps it is their common interest in archaeology.
 TROI / I don't think so.
 DATA / But Counselor, as an archaeologist, her company would certainly be intellectually stimulating to the Captain.
 GEORDI / She's not just stimulating his intellect, Data...
 TROI / It's really none of our business.
 PICARD / I'm in no mood for your foolishness, Q.
 PICARD / Whatever game you want to play will have to wait until tomorrow.
 PICARD / What woman?
 PICARD / You really must be bored, Q. You're letting your imagination run away with you.
 PICARD / Believe what you wish.
 PICARD / (very seriously) Stay away from her, Q.
 PICARD / (interrupting) ... is hereby nullified. I don't want your help... your advice... your favors... or for that matter -- you. Can you understand that once and for all?
 PICARD / Yes!
 RIKER / Knock 'em dead, Captain.
 PICARD / Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Archeology Council. Welcome. It is the mystery of Tagus Three that brings us together today... a mystery that has invited more argument and deduction than the best Sherlock Holmes or Dixon Hill tale. Well, if you'll excuse the conceit, you're about to hear my own detective story.
 PICARD (V.O.) / For several years, I have been trying to unravel the secrets of Tagus Three. Needless to say, I have not succeeded.
 PICARD / However, I have, I believe, turned up some new information, that if nothing else, raises a whole new set of mysteries that I hope we can discuss during our time togther.
 PICARD (V.O.) / There have been nine hundred and forty-seven known Archaeological excavations conducted on the planet's surface.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Out of that number some seventy-four are generally considered to have revealed findings of major importance.
 PICARD (V.O.) / The earliest took place some twenty-two thousand years ago.
 PICARD / The last was completed within the last four hundred years.
 PICARD / What the hell... !
 PICARD / (raging) Q!
 TROI / Is this Tagus Three?
 PICARD / I doubt there are many oak trees on Tagus. No, my guess is this is supposed to be Earth. (off reactions) Sometime around the twelfth century. And this is England, Sherwood Forest to be precise. Or at least Q's re-creation of it.
 RIKER / That explains these costumes.
 PICARD / Exactly, Number One. (a beat) Or should I say, John Little.
 BEVERLY / If he's Little John, that would make you...
 PICARD / I know. Robin Hood.
 WORF / Sir, I protest. I am not a merry man.
 DATA / On the contrary, Lieutenant Worf, your clothing identifies you with the character of Will Scarlett. Just as Geordi's Mandolin suggests he is Alan-A-Dale.
 RIKER / And you, Mister Data, bear a striking resemblance to one Friar Tuck.
 WORF / I will not play the fool for Q's amusement.
 PICARD / You're quite right, Worf. (loudly) Do you hear that Q? You may as well return us to our ship immediately.
 PICARD / Quick. Into the forest.
 PICARD / Mister Worf. That's an order.
 BEVERLY / (applying a makeshift bandage) I've managed to stop the bleeding.
 PICARD / It's about time you showed up, Q.
 PICARD / We will not share in this pointless fantasy of yours.
 PICARD / What consequences?
 GEORDI / Robbing from the rich to give to the poor?
 DATA / Are you referring to his rescue of Maid Marian from Nottingham Castle?
 PICARD / (grimly) Vash.
 PICARD / My feelings toward Vash are irrelevant. I'd attempt to save any innocent life, as you well know.
 PICARD / Q, I ask you to end this now, before anyone else gets hurt.
 TROI / Data, are you alright?
 DATA / The arrow impacted just above my sixth intercostal support, penetrating my secondary subprocessor.
 DATA / (continuing) Fortunately, none of my biofunctions seem impaired.
 DATA / Do not get discouraged. I believe your aim is improving.
 WORF / Sorry.
 RIKER / It's about time we got out of here, sir.
 PICARD / Not we Commander. You and the others are to wait here until I return.
 RIKER / You're not planning to go after her alone, are you?
 PICARD / This is not a mission. It's personal, between Q and myself. I don't want any of you involved.
 RIKER / But Captain...
 PICARD / You have your orders, Commander. I expect you to follow them.
 PICARD / Yes, I know.
 PICARD / My staff and I were brought here by an old adversary of mine named Q. I'll tell you the rest once we're safe.
 PICARD / Come, we don't have much time.
 PICARD / They're waiting for us back in Sherwood.
 PICARD / Yes, now let's...
 PICARD / An excellent one if you'd only hurry up.
 PICARD / Only too well.
 PICARD / I suppose you know of a better one.
 PICARD / And do what?
 PICARD / (ironic) That is brilliant.
 PICARD / You don't really expect me to leave you here?
 PICARD / Must you be so stubborn?
 PICARD / (to Vash) Behind me.
 PICARD (V.O.) / My fault?
 PICARD (V.O.) / We'd have been safe in Sherwood if you hadn't grabbed my sword.
 PICARD / You should have never interfered.
 PICARD / I was trying to rescue you.
 PICARD / I won't.
 PICARD / Can we just get this over with.
 PICARD / Your game was for my benefit, Q. She is innocent in all this.
 PICARD / Let her go.
 GEORDI / Too many of them. We'd never get to the Captain...
 RIKER / Data, we need a diversion. Now.
 DATA / (to Riker) Please stand back, Commander. Microfusion cells can be somewhat dangerous under high temperatures...
 PICARD / That's very impressive.
 PICARD / But there's something you should know.
 PICARD / I'm not from Nottingham.
 PICARD / (shouting) It's over, Q. Now get us out of here.
 PICARD / If any of my people are hurt...
 PICARD / (end of his patience) Enough of this.
 RIKER / Everybody here?
 TROI / Where's Vash?
 PICARD / Computer, locate Council Member Vash.
 PICARD / (smiling) Well, this is a relief. I was afraid that Q...
 PICARD / I'm surprised he wasn't too busy gloating over his victory.
 PICARD / I may not share my feelings with my crew, but I do have them.
 PICARD / I wouldn't be surprised if our paths cross again.
 PICARD / So, where are you off to now?
 PICARD / (amused in spite of himself) As a matter of fact... yes.
 PICARD / As payment in full for your debt to me, you will guarantee her safety...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44769.2. For some weeks we have had a Klingon exo-biologist on board as part of a scientific exchange program. Unfortunately, we suspect that he may have been involved not only in a security breach but in the possible sabotage of our warp drive.
 RIKER / What were you doing accessing the propulsion system files on Stardate 44758?
 RIKER / But you did... from computer Twelve-B-Nine on Deck Thirty-six.
 RIKER / The computer logged in your identification from your communicator.
 TROI / J'Dan... we have confirmed reports that schematic drawings of our dilithium chamber fell into Romulan hands... one week later.
 RIKER / And you don't know anything about the explosion that disabled the warp drive at almost the same time?
 TROI / Our Chief Security Officer is Klingon, J'Dan -- that has nothing to do with it.
 RIKER / We've discussed that with the Klingon High Council. You'll be sent back... as soon as we've finished our investigation.
 RIKER / Very well. Mister Worf... please accompany the Lieutenant to his quarters.
 RIKER / What do you think?
 TROI / It's hard to tell. He is very closed... but...
 TROI / He is hiding something.
 WORF / I do not know how you managed to transfer secret information to the Romulans... but I will find out.
 WORF / And when we inform the Klingon High Council, they will put you to a slow death.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Retired Admiral Norah Satie, whose investigation exposed the alien conspiracy against Starfleet Command three years ago, is arriving to assist in our investigation.
 PICARD and Riker watch as a group MATERIALIZES on the / pad: SABIN GENESTRA, a Betazoid man; NELLEN TORE, a female assistant, and ADMIRAL NORAH SATIE, retired. She surveys the waiting group before her, finds Picard, and smiles radiantly. Norah Satie is middle-aged, a beautiful woman who has become more so with maturity. She is gracious, elegant, and decidedly feminine. Her smile is generous, bespeaking warmth and intelligence. She moves toward Picard, hand extended.
 PICARD / Admiral Satie. Welcome to the Enterprise.
 PICARD / And my First Officer, Commander William Riker. May I show you to your quarters?
 PICARD / Very well... Commander, will you see to the Admiral's Staff?
 DATA and GEORDI oversee a scene which finds the section / isolation door between the dilithium chamber and the pool table area closed. Behind the door there are clouds of gas, and the hatch of the chamber has been blown off.
 GEORDI / We still can't get in there, Captain. The radiation levels are dropping, but they're too high to raise the isolation door.
 PICARD / How much longer will it be?
 DATA / At the rate the levels have been decreasing, we will be able to gain entry in forty-nine hours.
 GEORDI / Maybe the Admiral would like to see the visual log of the explosion.
 GEORDI / This was logged four days ago... at oh-three hundred hours.
 GEORDI / At that point the emergency confinement field was activated and the isolation doors came down. No one was killed, but two of my people are in Sickbay with radiation burns.
 DATA / A slow-motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulation frame collapsed.
 PICARD / (acknowledging) That is one reason we tend to suspect sabotage.
 DATA / Other evidence lends credence to that theory, Captain. A review of the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well within normal parameters until fifty-two milliseconds before the explosion.
 GEORDI / We haven't found anything that suggests there was a malfunction anywhere along the line.
 WORF / Excuse me, Doctor...
 BEVERLY / Yes, Lieutenant?
 WORF / When you have a moment... I must ask you something...
 BEVERLY / Good timing. I'm finished here... Mister Tarses... ?
 BEVERLY / Please enter these readings into Ensign Dagget's file.
 BEVERLY / What is it, Worf?
 WORF / Did you issue this to J'Dan?
 BEVERLY / Looks like a micro-replicating hyposyringe... but it's not Starfleet issue...
 WORF / It was found... in his quarters.
 BEVERLY / J'Dan has Ba'ltmasor Syndrome... he comes in regularly for treatments... but we use our own hyposprays. Is this one Klingon?
 WORF / Yes. Do you know what this attachment is?
 BEVERLY / No... it's nothing we use...
 WORF / Thank you, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / (a bit puzzled) I hope that helps.
 WORF / You've told me exactly what I wanted to hear.
 PICARD / There are disturbing overtones... to the idea of a Klingon providing information to the Romulans...
 PICARD / Are you... aware... of any other Romulan-Klingon connections that Starfleet Command might have encountered recently?
 PICARD / This ship has had several encounters which might suggest a potential alliance between those two powers --
 PICARD / Come.
 WORF / Excuse me, Captain, I didn't know --
 PICARD / Please come in Mister Worf. I particularly want our guest to meet you... Admiral Satie... my head of security, Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / Captain... I have been pursuing the investigation of Lieutenant J'Dan. I believe I know how he transferred information off the Enterprise.
 WORF / (producing the syringe) This is J'Dan's. It is fitted with an optical reader... specially modified to read data from Starfleet isolinear chips.
 WORF / He can extract digital information from a computer... encode it in the form of amino-acid sequences, and transfer those sequences into a fluid in the syringe... Then he injects someone, perhaps even without their knowledge...
 WORF / The information would be carried in their bloodstream in the form of inert proteins.
 WORF / I would be honored.
 WORF / I tracked the movements of each person who left the Enterprise since you've been here. I traced one Tarkanian diplomat as far as the Cruces system... where he disappeared and has not been seen since.
 WORF / This was found in your quarters.
 WORF / But your injections don't require an optical chip reader. This device -- (points to it) -- has only one function: to transform computer information into biological sequences.
 PICARD / You may have him confined, Mister Worf.
 PICARD / If you're right... someone else may be involved.
 PICARD / It's hard for me to believe... but I am grateful for your presence, Admiral. If anyone in Starfleet can help us, it's you.
 PICARD / In what way... ?
 PICARD / That sounds like Judge Aaron Satie...
 PICARD / Through his writing. His judicial decisions were required reading at the Academy.
 PICARD / I'm willing to wager you trounced your brothers in those debates...
 PICARD / You must miss him very much.
 WORF / J'Dan did not make friends easily... there are not many to question...
 WORF / I am strongly motivated in this matter.
 WORF / (stiffens) My father...
 WORF / My father... what he did or did not do... is no one's concern but my own...
 WORF / If there is a conspiracy on board, I promise you I will find it...
 WORF / (acknowledges) I will arrange for the interviews to begin.
 BEVERLY / About once a week.
 BEVERLY / No. One of my assistants did that...
 BEVERLY / No, nothing. In fact, he rarely talked at all.
 PICARD / Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we appreciate your time. You are excused now. Mister Worf, will you bring in the next person?
 PICARD / Please sit down, Mister Tarses. For the record, will you state your name and position?
 PICARD / I assure you this is an informal inquiry... we're not accusing you of anything. However, if you want counsel, it will be provided for you.
 PICARD / Very well. How long have you held your appointment on the Enterprise?
 PICARD / You're excused, Crewman.
 PICARD / Mister Worf...
 PICARD / It was clear he was frightened, but that's hardly an indication --
 PICARD / I'm not sure I can sanction any action against Mister Tarses based solely on Betazoid intuitions.
 PICARD / I must admit... that I'm a bit uneasy with this use of a Betazoid.
 PICARD / There is a difference between a counselor... and an investigator.
 PICARD / I do... but I don't act on the basis of her instincts alone.
 PICARD / You're asking me to restrict Tarses' movements -- based on Sabin's "feeling."
 PICARD / I have to admit I probably would. And maybe I should re-evaluate that behavior.
 PICARD / If we had better evidence...
 PICARD / (he's sure now) No. I won't treat a man as a criminal unless there is probable cause to do so.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Engineering to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / Yes, Mister La Forge...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Sir, could you come to Engineering right away? We've got something interesting to show you.
 PICARD / We'll be right there.
 GEORDI / We finally got in here about six hours ago, and we've been going over it inch by inch ever since.
 DATA / We have made micro-tomographic analyses of the dilithium chamber... the hatch mounting... the blast pattern from the explosion...
 GEORDI / We did mass spectrometer readings of the residue for chemical content... sifted the debris for bomb fragments...
 GEORDI / See the frame for the hatch... ? It ruptured -- (gestures) -- right there. And when we take a reading of that spot...
 GEORDI / See?
 PICARD / There are sub-micron fractures in the metal casing...
 GEORDI / That's right. A breakdown in the atomic cohesive structure.
 DATA / Those fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue. I would speculate that when the engine was last inspected at McKinley station, the hatch casing was replaced with one which had an undetectable defect.
 DATA / I think, sir, that the conclusion of our investigation must be that the explosion was not intentional.
 GEORDI / That's the way I see it. This wasn't sabotage at all... it was nothing more than an accident.
 PICARD / If my men say there was no sabotage, you can be sure there was none.
 PICARD / Do we know that for sure?
 PICARD / It would be difficult... but not impossible...
 WORF / We must continue to investigate Tarses. He was hiding something.
 PICARD / I remind you all... that Tarses is innocent... until he is proven guilty.
 PICARD / Very well. But I hope we can put the matter to rest as quickly as possible.
 PICARD / You've opened the hearing to spectators?
 PICARD / This hearing is convened on Stardate 44740 as a continuing inquiry into the activities of Crewman Simon Tarses. (beat) Mister Tarses... for your own protection, I have assigned you counsel in the person of Commander William Riker.
 BEVERLY / With the Captain's permission, I would like to make a statement.
 RIKER / It's not irregular to have a statement read into the record. This is a hearing, not a trial.
 PICARD / Doctor, you may come forward.
 BEVERLY / Thank you. I would like to go on record as saying that I have worked with Crewman Tarses for eighteen months. His work has been exemplary. He is a model of diligence and reliability. He is devoted to Starfleet and as far as I'm concerned, his loyalty is without question. (beat) There's no way this man is a traitor.
 BEVERLY / Thank you for letting me speak.
 BEVERLY / Well, yes... he came in for injections --
 BEVERLY / (after a beat) I think so... maybe in Ten-Forward...
 BEVERLY / I don't see what relevance that has here -- it was an innocent social gathering...
 PICARD / Thank you, Doctor Crusher. You are excused.
 PICARD / Admiral Satie... if you have a case to make against Tarses, you had better make it. Or I am calling this off here and now.
 RIKER / I object, sir... There is no basis for calling Officer Tarses a liar.
 PICARD / (angry) Agreed. Mister Sabin...
 WORF / Ensign Bailey, you and Crewman Marcus will coordinate to track Tarses' movements for the last five years. Ensign Kellogg, I want a list of all his relatives... his known associates... especially old school friends...
 WORF / And make arrangements to do an encephalographic polygraph scan...
 PICARD / Mister Worf...
 WORF / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / I need to speak with you.
 WORF / You are dismissed. Please get your reports to me as soon as possible.
 PICARD / What is going on here?
 WORF / Captain... I am conducting the investigation of Simon Tarses.
 PICARD / What has happened to us, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Sir?
 PICARD / I think... we're putting on a drumhead trial...
 WORF / I don't understand...
 PICARD / Five hundred years ago military officers would upend a drum on the battlefield... sit at it and dispense summary justice... decisions were quick... punishments severe... appeals denied. Those who came to a drumhead were doomed.
 WORF / But... we know there is a traitor here. J'Dan has admitted his guilt.
 PICARD / That's true. And he will stand for his crimes.
 WORF / Tarses has all but done the same.
 PICARD / (a sharp look) How?
 WORF / He refused to answer the question... about his Romulan grandfather.
 PICARD / That is not a crime, Worf. Nor can we infer his guilt because he did not respond.
 WORF / If a man is not afraid of the truth, he would answer.
 PICARD / No. We must not let ourselves think that. The Seventh Guarantee is one of the most important rights granted by the Federation. We cannot use one of the fundamental principles of our Constitution and turn it against a citizen.
 WORF / Sir... the Federation does have enemies... we must seek them out...
 PICARD / Yes... that's how it starts. But the road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is shorter than we might think. Something is wrong here, Worf... I don't like what we have become.
 PICARD / Here you are, Mister Tarses... do you care for lemon?
 PICARD / Tell me a little about yourself, Crewman... I know you were born on Mars Colony...
 PICARD / Did you ever consider applying to the Academy... going the whole route and becoming an officer?
 PICARD / An elm tree? With a circular bench?
 PICARD / I spent many an hour there. It was my favorite spot to study.
 PICARD / But you didn't do it.
 PICARD / Not if you aren't guilty.
 PICARD / Admiral Satie...
 PICARD / I'd like to talk to you.
 PICARD / In private...
 PICARD / ... and off the record.
 PICARD / But I do. This must stop. It's gone too far... you lied to him about the Engine Room -- there was no volatile chemical found there...
 PICARD / We are hounding an innocent man.
 PICARD / I talked with him.
 PICARD / No... he admits his mistake in falsifying his application... but that doesn't make him a traitor.
 PICARD / (not intimidated) The hearings on Simon Tarses must stop. If necessary, I will go to Starfleet Command.
 PICARD / What are you saying -- ?
 PICARD / You never told me about this --
 PICARD / Admiral... what you're doing here... is unethical... it's immoral... and I will fight it.
 DATA / Captain, the warp engines are back on line. We are ready to commence restart sequences.
 DATA / Sir?
 PICARD / (snapping out of it) Yes... ? Oh... yes, Mister Data. Proceed.
 PICARD / Yes, of course. Just a bit -- preoccupied.
 PICARD / Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / Captain, Federation Starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / Over three years. Since Stardate 41140.
 PICARD / If you don't mind... I would like to address the committee.
 PICARD / I believe that Chapter Four, Article Twelve of the Uniform Code of Justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioning begins...
 PICARD / I am deeply concerned by what is happening here. It began when we apprehended a spy, a man who admitted his guilt and who will answer for his crime. But the hunt didn't stop there. Another man, Simon Tarses, was brought to trial -- and it was a trial, no matter what others may call it.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, it was a trial based on insinuation and innuendo. Nothing substantive against Crewman Tarses was offered, much less proven.
 PICARD / This man has a Romulan grandfather. For that, his career stands in ruins. Have we become so fearful? Have we become so cowardly that we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a current enemy?
 PICARD / I remind you... we are not descended from cowardly people. We come from those who were willing to think the unthinkable, speak the unspeakable... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / ... and to defend with passion ideas and causes which were, at the moment, unpopular.
 PICARD / Admiral, let us not condemn Simon Tarses or anyone else on the basis of half-truth. I implore you... do not continue with this proceeding. End it here.
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / Your point, Admiral... ?
 PICARD / My reports to Starfleet document the circumstances in each of those instances --
 PICARD / Excuse me?
 PICARD / I was following orders to deliver the ambassador to a destination near the Neutral Zone, and --
 PICARD / That's correct.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / There was no chance of getting her back. We were deep in Romulan space. The safety of my crew was my primary concern.
 WORF / (rises to defend Picard) The Enterprise could have been captured by Romulans... Captain Picard did the only thing he could.
 PICARD / Lieutenant?
 PICARD / Yes. I am fully recovered.
 PICARD / There is a saying... which many of us have heard since we were school children... "With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied -- chains us all, irrevocably."
 PICARD / Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie -- as wisdom and warning. The very first time any man's freedoms are trampled... we are all damaged. (beat) I fear... that today... on this starship... we are forging that chain.
 WORF / Am I bothering you, sir?
 PICARD / No... please, come in, Mister Worf.
 WORF / It's over. Admiral Henry has called an end to any more hearings on this matter.
 PICARD / That's good.
 WORF / Admiral Satie... has left the Enterprise.
 PICARD / We think we have come so far... the torture of heretics and the burning of witches is ancient history... and then... before you can blink an eye... it threatens to start all over again.
 WORF / I believed her... I helped her... I didn't see what she was.
 PICARD / Villains who wear black hats are easy to spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well camouflaged.
 WORF / I think... after yesterday... people will not be as ready to trust her.
 PICARD / Maybe. But it won't stop her. She -- someone like her -- will always be with us... waiting for the right climate to flourish... spreading disease in the name of liberty. (beat) Vigilance, Worf. That is the price we must continually pay.
 TROI (V.O.) / Counselor Deanna Troi, personal log, stardate 44805.3...
 TROI (V.O.) / (Continuing) ... My mother is on board.
 PICARD / As a matter of fact, I...
 PICARD / Yes, indeed.
 PICARD / Well at the moment, Lwaxana, I am rather busy.
 PICARD / Yes. The leading scientist of Kaelon Two and...
 PICARD / This is a delicate situation, Lwaxana... our first real contact with a very reclusive people... (trying to disengage) And as it will be something of an official greeting...
 GEORDI waiting; O'BRIEN alongside his panel -- as / Picard and the still-entwined Lwaxana ENTER.
 PICARD / Energize, please, Mister O'Brien.
 PICARD / Doctor Timicin? I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of The Enterprise. This is Lieutenant Commander La Forge.
 PICARD / (Continuing; beat) We welcome you aboard, Sir.
 PICARD / Ah, I beg your pardon. Doctor Timicin, may I present Lwaxana Troi, of Betazed; also a guest on board, and...
 PICARD / We have quite a bit of work planned...
 PICARD / It, uh... would seem Mrs. Troi is our acting ambassador of good will today.
 GEORDI / That man is in a lot of trouble.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log. Stardate 44805.7. For generations, the people of Kaelon Two have been working to revitalize their dying sun. The Federation has offered to assist in testing what may be a solution to this problem.
 DATA / The modifications that you have made on the torpedo's guidance systems are remarkable, doctor...
 PICARD / (nods) Our only regret is that it took us three years to find a suitable star after you first contacted us.
 GEORDI / It's your work that's made this possible, Doctor...
 BEVERLY / That's right, we're only the delivery service here...
 WORF at his post, contending with a superficially / inquisitive Lwaxana. Supernumeraries at other posts.
 WORF / Mrs. Troi, I must protest your unauthorized presence on the Bridge.
 WORF / (quickly) Please, Madame! That is a torpedo launch initiator. And it, uh... it is Worf, Madame; not Woof.
 TROI / Yes, Mother, what did you want?
 TROI / You were waiting for me.
 TROI / Mother.
 TROI / Mother!
 RIKER / Mrs. Troi? I'll have to ask you to clear the Bridge now, please.
 TROI / Mother? Please!
 GEORDI / (mid-discussion) Is that why you reset the torpedo sustainer engines to run on less reactants?
 GEORDI / That mess? Mrs. Troi...
 GEORDI / (mutters) How can he?
 DATA / It is true that the intellectual efficiency of high order beings does diminish proportionately when the deprivation of rest or nutritious fuel is...
 GEORDI / (interrupts; gives up) All right, all right; don't you start.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44807.5. The Enterprise has arrived at the Praxillus system, where we will conduct Doctor Timicin's helium ignition test.
 TROI / Mother, how much...
 TROI / We are not alone, Mother. Now how much longer will this take? You've been selecting for twenty minutes.
 TROI / That's not very telepathic of you.
 TROI / You know, you're not just incorrigible; you're insatiable.
 WORF / Captain... I have completed long range scans. No life forms are present in the system.
 RIKER / Spacecraft?
 WORF / No others within sensor range...
 PICARD / Picard to Engineering...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / ... the system is clear, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Final pre-launch diagnostic. Level Five.
 GEORDI / (to com) We're ready when you are, Captain.
 PICARD / Very well. Mister Worf?
 WORF / Photon torpedoes... armed and targeted.
 PICARD / Fire in sequence.
 WORF / First volley released...
 DATA / Tracking torpedoes... entry program confirmed.
 WORF / Second volley released... third volley...
 GEORDI / Torpedoes now entering the stellar core.
 GEORDI / Ignition sequence... six seconds... three seconds... Now.
 GEORDI / Shock wave patterns within predicted range. Seventeen hundred percent rise in gamma radiation levels. Helium fusion rate increasing...
 GEORDI / Steady so far. Density at eleven hundred grams per cubic centimeter. Temperature approaching sixty million degrees Kelvin.
 DATA / Pressure wave harmonics dispersing. Temperature in target zone increasing... to eighty-one million degrees.
 GEORDI / Still rising. Ninety million degrees Kelvin... And now one hundred ten million. (to Timicin) Looking good.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / One hundred thirty-seven...
 DATA / (re his board) Radiation and pressure levels still stable.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Temperature one hundred sixty million degrees Kelvin...
 GEORDI / One seventy... one ninety... Now two hundred million...
 GEORDI / Two-oh-seven, and rising. (beat) Two-nineteen... (whoopee!) And twenty! Two twenty! (long beat) And holding!
 GEORDI / Looks like congratulations may be in order.
 PICARD / (hopeful) Mister Data?
 DATA / Turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters.
 GEORDI / (quietly) Two-twenty-two...
 DATA / Temperature is rising in the core again, Captain. Two hundred and thirty million degrees Kelvin...
 GEORDI / (dull, flat) ... Now two-fifty-one. Still rising. Two hundred sixty million degrees.
 DATA / Rate exceeding critical levels. Core density becoming unstable.
 RIKER / Let's get the hell out of here.
 PICARD / Warp two, Ensign; now!
 GEORDI / I'm sorry.
 PICARD / (to helm) Ensign... set a course for Kaelon Two. Warp factor five.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44812.6. We are orbiting Kaelon Two, and have established contact with Science Minister B'tardat.
 PICARD / (mid-discussion) The experiment did achieve a stable core temperature for a short time, Minister... that is a significant step forward...
 RIKER / We're studying the sensor logs and torpedo telemetry to see if there was any malfunction... if we can discover the problem, another test might be successful.
 PICARD / The Federation is willing to assist in the search.
 RIKER / In the meantime, all of our facilities would be available to Doctor Timicin while he analyzes the experiment.
 PICARD / (after a beat) We're more than willing to extend our visit, sir.
 PICARD / Come...
 PICARD / I beg your pardon?
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / The people of Kaelon Two are isolationists. Almost to the point of being xenophobes. Regrettably, we know very little about their customs.
 PICARD / I'm afraid I have no choice.
 PICARD / Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but I have no jurisdiction here; irrespective of any personal feelings. We simply cannot interfere --
 PICARD / (gently, but firmly) The Prime Directive forbids us to interfere with the social order of any planet.
 PICARD / Computer? Locate Counselor Troi.
 TROI / Mother? What's going on? What are you doing?
 TROI / He can't, Mother. he has his orders.
 TROI / No, they apply to him.
 TROI (TELEPATHIC V.O.) / Come on, Mother, let's sit down.
 TROI (TELEPATHIC V.O.) / There's no need to be.
 TROI (TELEPATHIC V.O.) / You cried when father died.
 TROI / Of course I remember. We both cried.
 TROI / What do you think, Mother?
 TROI / (surprised) You... afraid? I never could tell...
 TROI / You're feeling very vulnerable; very... (gentle smile) ... mortal, if I may say so. I know you so well, Mother. And believe me, you will never be one of those who dies before they die.
 DATA / ... Until the pressure levels destabilized, all the results were exactly as you had predicted...
 GEORDI / Worked perfectly... that much we're sure of...
 GEORDI / (consoling) Just getting this far is a big step, Doctor... no one's ever been able to do even this much before...
 DATA / (possible explanation) There was a evidence of a delayed surface shock...
 DATA / (concerned) Perhaps, but there is no known method of controlling neutron migration, Doctor.
 PICARD / (calls o.s.) Come.
 PICARD / Timicin. Time for you to leave us, then.
 PICARD / Any influence, Minister, is by example only. Timicin's decision is of his own free will, I assure you.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, scanners indicate two Kaelon warships rising on an intercept course.
 PICARD / Acknowledged, Commander. (to the monitor) Minister, we are here in friendship, hoping to provide assistance...
 PICARD / Doctor, you have acted in good conscience... I don't know what else you could have done...
 PICARD / I'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that, Doctor.
 PICARD / (beat, with history) Isn't she.
 PICARD / Any communication, Number One?
 RIKER / No, sir. We have an open channel.
 WORF / The warships have taken a standard attack posture... staggered approach vectors... within weapons range.
 PICARD / Shields up. Red Alert.
 PICARD / Doctor, I suggest you return to your quarters...
 BEVERLY / They'll be doing everything they can to avoid it... but we need to get out of their way now...
 PICARD / (at work) Mister Worf, ascertain their offensive potential...
 WORF / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / We've already tried...
 DATA / They refuse to accept further reports from you, Doctor.
 GEORDI / They've disengaged the link-up, sir...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Doctor Timicin...
 RIKER / (continuing) ... you have a visitor coming aboard.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / No, doctor... it's your daughter.
 TROI / Not sure of yourself?
 TROI / You were honest with him, mother... how could you be anything else?
 TROI / Of course you do. But you didn't do this for yourself, mother. You did it for him.
 TROI / Ritual provides a structure for a society... good rituals, bad rituals alike...
 TROI / Your point of view.
 TROI / I'll see you later, mother.
 PICARD / I would deeply regret it, Doctor, if you were returning only to ease diplomatic tensions...
 PICARD / Then I wish you and your people well.
 PICARD / If there's any reason you'd like to wait a few minutes...
 PICARD / Permission granted.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Doctor Beverly Crusher, Personal Log, Stardate 44821.3. Began an analysis today of the respiratory problems being experienced by the populations on the two moons of Peliar Zel. (beat) Finally got an actual letter from Wesley... topped the class in exo-biology, but he's still struggling in Ancient Philosophies. (beat) And... there's... a new man in my life.
 DATA / Ambassador Odan... Doctor Crusher... I was just on my way to see you.
 BEVERLY / Hello, Data...
 DATA / I have completed my study of the atmospheric variations which have occurred on the moons since the new technology was implemented.
 DATA / I could go over them with you now. It would not require more than two hours.
 BEVERLY / We do appreciate it, Data... but the Ambassador and I have set aside this time... to analyze the incidence of lung disease among the moons' inhabitants.
 DATA / Then it is perfect timing, Doctor -- what better occasion to integrate my results into your study?
 BEVERLY / (picking it up) Ambassador, are you still having those awful headaches? I'll bring you a hypospray to take care of it...
 BEVERLY / Put a cold cloth on your forehead and lie down, Ambassador. I'll be with you shortly.
 BEVERLY / I'll set you up at the medical monitor, Data... it'll take you a while to input the figures, won't it?
 DATA / (puzzled by the speed) At least an hour... but I do not believe much time can be saved from that estimate by exhibiting such haste now...
 BEVERLY / Data... there are times... when every second does count.
 BEVERLY / If I don't get back and look at his projections, he might come looking for me.
 BEVERLY / I can't believe this has happened... in just a week...
 BEVERLY / Odan... are we... is this... interfering? With your work on the Peliar Zel problems?
 BEVERLY / Odan... I have to get back...
 BEVERLY / I promise...
 BEVERLY / It's just Beverly...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Ambassador Odan...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / The Federation representative from Peliar Zel has come on board. (MORE)
 PICARD'S COM VOICE (Cont'd) / Could you meet us in the Observation Lounge?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / And Ambassador... if you should run into Doctor Crusher, would you ask her to join us as well?
 Picard is already there, standing with LEKA, a representative of the Federation planet Peliar Zel, RIKER, TROI, and Data. Beverly ENTERS, nods toward / Picard, who nods back, expressionless. She moves toward a seat next to Troi.
 TROI / (sotto) Where've you been?
 BEVERLY / (likewise) With a patient. Minor emergency.
 PICARD / Ambassador Odan, this is Governor Leka Trion, of Peliar Zel.
 DATA / I hope Doctor Crusher was able to help you with your headache.
 PICARD / Governor Leka has intercepted us before we reached her planet in order to update us on the situation.
 DATA / My design models suggest that Beta will begin to experience rising temperatures... erratic tide surges... and in general the beginnings of global warming.
 BEVERLY / The impact on the health of the Betan people is clear. There will be profound medical repercussions.
 PICARD / We will be in orbit around Peliar Zel within six hours. If you can arrange for the representatives of Alpha and Beta to be there, Ambassador Odan can beam directly to the planet.
 PICARD / As you like.
 PICARD / Counselor... ?
 TROI / It's Ambassador Odan... I continue to feel such... fluctuations... of emotion from him.
 PICARD / (dryly) Maybe it's just spring, Deanna... (off her look) Or perhaps these sensations are perfectly normal among the Trill.
 TROI / It could be... we know so little about them...
 TROI / But he seems a lovely person... very much a gentleman, don't you think?
 PICARD / Yes. Quite.
 TROI / Is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes? I've never tried it...
 BEVERLY / Yes... I mean, I guess it is... someone just put it on me...
 TROI / I never knew you even came in here...
 BEVERLY / I don't. I mean, not usually...
 TROI / But sometimes it feels good just to indulge yourself...
 BEVERLY / I guess so...
 TROI / Especially when you haven't done so for a while...
 BEVERLY / What's that supposed to mean?
 TROI / Beverly... you're in love.
 BEVERLY / How... how did you know?
 TROI / (gently) I don't really think it's much of a secret.
 BEVERLY / It isn't?
 TROI / No. You've been -- glowing.
 BEVERLY / "Glowing... " Well, yeah... that's just how I feel, Deanna...
 BEVERLY / What... ?
 TROI / Nothing --
 BEVERLY / Yes, there is, I can tell. What is it?
 TROI / Just... something I sense in Odan.
 BEVERLY / What? What do you sense?
 TROI / I'm not sure how to describe it... and I'm not saying there's anything wrong, it's just... (beat) Beverly... how well do you really know him?
 BEVERLY / I... I feel like I know him better than anyone I've ever known... but...
 BEVERLY / Am I being foolish? I don't think so... and yet... it's only been a couple of weeks... Of course, maybe that means it's just infatuation... but I'm a grown up, I know the difference between love and infatuation...
 BEVERLY / But one thing I'm sure of... is that I haven't felt like this in a long time...
 TROI / And you like it...
 BEVERLY / I like it.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Yes, Ambassador. We've entered orbit... the shuttle will transport you to the surface in a few minutes.
 PICARD / How will you proceed once you're there?
 PICARD / It seems to work well for you.
 PICARD / My staff is quite capable. I'm glad they've been useful.
 PICARD / I'm sure that's true. Well... shall we make our way to the Shuttlebay?
 PICARD / I wouldn't presume to speak for her.
 PICARD / Yes, Ensign?
 PICARD / Very well.
 GEORDI / Commander Riker asked to pilot you himself, Ambassador.
 BEVERLY / I know... have a safe trip.
 BEVERLY / Yes, it is...
 DATA / Initiate shuttle pre-flight sequence.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Pre-flight under way... counting to clearance...
 DATA / Shuttle has cleared the Bay door.
 WORF / Commander Riker, you will be out of shield range in five seconds.
 RIKER / Acknowledged, Lieutenant. We'll be entering the upper ionosphere in two minutes, twenty seconds.
 WORF / Captain... an unidentified ship is emerging from the limb of the moon.
 PICARD / Hail the vessel.
 RIKER / I have visual contact. I don't recognize it.
 WORF / Sir, it claims to be an escort vessel from the Beta moon.
 PICARD / There was no mention of an escort... request a security clearance code.
 WORF / They do not answer, sir.
 PICARD / Commander, stand by to return to the Shuttlebay.
 WORF / Captain -- the escort ship is loading its phaser banks!
 RIKER / Increasing power to the shields... coming about...
 PICARD / Engage tractor beam. Number One -- report.
 RIKER / We've lost the port thruster and both back-up stabilizers... I'm losing control...
 PICARD / We're bringing you in.
 RIKER / Captain, the shuttle hull has been weakened. We're breaking up... you can't tow us. Better beam us directly on board...
 RIKER / I can't stabilize the shuttle...
 PICARD / Number One... we're ready to beam you aboard.
 RIKER / Belay that, Captain. I'm going to bring her in manually. (beat) Advise Doctor Crusher we have a medical emergency.
 BEVERLY / He's in shock... he's lost a lot of blood... but that doesn't account for these readings...
 BEVERLY / Eosinophilia in the cerebrospinal fluid at forty-six percent.
 BEVERLY / It's as though there's a parasite at work...
 BEVERLY / Odan... I have to do exploratory surgery. You may have a parasitic infection...
 BEVERLY / But... you won't survive...
 BEVERLY / What is that... ?
 BEVERLY / What... ?
 BEVERLY / You're dying... what can I do?
 BEVERLY / Odan's host body died of the injuries just over an hour ago. But the symbiont being... Odan... is still alive.
 BEVERLY / Odan is the one who negotiated the last treaty. The man everyone thought was his father was just another host body.
 RIKER / And the reason Odan refused the transporter...
 BEVERLY / (acknowledging) It would have damaged the symbiont.
 PICARD / (to the others) We have contacted the Trill. Another host will arrive within forty hours.
 BEVERLY / I've placed Odan in stasis. He can survive for an hour... maybe two... but not beyond that.
 DATA / Is it possible I could serve as a temporary carrier?
 BEVERLY / No, Data. The relationship requires a biological being.
 PICARD / We are at a desperate impasse with the situation in the Peliar system. The attack on our shuttlecraft has inflamed the dispute.
 TROI / Who was responsible, Captain?
 PICARD / No one will admit anything. Each side accuses the other and threats are mounting. We need Odan...
 RIKER / Doctor... could a human host carry him?
 BEVERLY / I... believe so. From Odan's description of the process... it should be possible. But --
 RIKER / (rising) Then I volunteer.
 BEVERLY / There's been no precedent for a human host. I couldn't guarantee what... what might happen.
 PICARD / Would you be able to remove the symbiont when the new host arrives?
 BEVERLY / In theory, yes. I just don't know what might happen to a human body in the process.
 PICARD / Commander... the risk is too great.
 RIKER / Weigh it against the prospect of war.
 PICARD / It is your choice, Will.
 RIKER / Then let's get to it.
 BEVERLY / I've given you a local anesthetic... but you must be conscious while the implantation takes place. Drugs might damage the symbiont.
 RIKER / I understand.
 BEVERLY / Laser scalpel.
 BEVERLY / How are you feeling? Is there pain?
 RIKER / No... just... strange sensations...
 BEVERLY / (to Ogawa) Vital signs?
 BEVERLY / I can't close yet... the assimilation isn't complete...
 BEVERLY / He's going to start fibrillating. Two hundred milligrams metrazene...
 BEVERLY / Will... hang on...
 BEVERLY / I'm closing...
 BEVERLY / The metrazene should have stabilized him... I'll give it ten seconds more before we go in again.
 BEVERLY / That's better... signs are returning to normal.
 BEVERLY / Will... it's Beverly. Can you hear me?
 RIKER / Hello...
 BEVERLY / (smiling back) You're going to be all right. How do you feel?
 RIKER / I am just fine... but you look tired, Doctor Beverly.
 RIKER / I realize it will be disturbing, Governor... but you must convince the inhabitants of the moons that I am Odan... I have his thoughts, his memories, his skills...
 RIKER / The man they knew as my father... the man who stands before them now... both are merely hosts. It is your task to help them understand.
 RIKER / Speak softly, Governor. People who cannot hear an angry shout... will often strain to hear a whisper.
 PICARD / Well done.
 RIKER / Sorry... a little dizzy...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, take the Ambassador to his quarters.
 RIKER / I'll be all right... just need to lie down a minute...
 PICARD / Bridge to Crusher...
 BEVERLY / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / The Ambassador is not well. Please see to him in his quarters.
 BEVERLY / Right away, sir.
 BEVERLY / I'm getting a slightly elevated white cell count... six-tenths of a degree of temperature... (casts a glance toward him) ... nothing that indicates rejection.
 RIKER / That's good...
 BEVERLY / But you look awfully pale...
 RIKER / Just a little weak... light-headed...
 BEVERLY / Cerebral blood flow looks normal...
 BEVERLY / I'll leave you a metabolic booster... use it if the symptoms get worse...
 RIKER / Beverly...
 BEVERLY / Beyond that, I don't know what to do. (beat) This is... all new for me.
 RIKER / For me as well.
 RIKER / Please don't go... we need to talk about this...
 BEVERLY / I... don't know what to say... where to begin...
 RIKER / Nor do I... but I know that silence will injure us...
 BEVERLY / Maybe you should have thought about that sooner. Maybe you should have told me what you were. It didn't bother you to stay silent yesterday...
 RIKER / But... it never occurred to me. This is what I am... did you tell me you are only a single being? Of course not... it is normal for you...
 BEVERLY / I don't know how to handle this... I just... don't know who you are...
 RIKER / (sadly) I understand... but whoever I seem to be... I am Odan... the man who loved you... and that has not changed. I still love you. I can't help that.
 RIKER / But if that causes you pain... I will suppress it. I will keep my distance, Doctor Beverly. I would never hurt you.
 DATA / Five card draw. Ante up.
 GEORDI / Commander -- come on in...
 DATA / Geordi... I believe the correct term now would be "Ambassador."
 RIKER / You can call me anything you like. I know this must be difficult for you. (beat) May I join you?
 GEORDI / (too quickly) Sure! Sit down... right here...
 WORF / We are pleased you're here.
 DATA / Are you familiar with this game, Ambassador?
 RIKER / No.
 RIKER / But... I seem to have done this before...
 DATA / Ambassador, what is the precise nature of the symbiotic joining? Are you Odan? Or Commander Riker? Or a combination of both?
 RIKER / I wish I could give you an answer as simple as the question. Ordinarily, the host body has no personality. This time... is different somehow.
 RIKER / I've never done this... and yet I know how.
 RIKER / And something compelled me to come here tonight... though I didn't consciously know what would await me. It is as though... Will Riker is here with me... I have never felt that with other hosts.
 GEORDI / (rhetorical) I guess the question is... will the Commander be alright... when he comes back?
 RIKER / Gentlemen... I am making you uncomfortable. Please... continue without me.
 TROI / May I join you?
 BEVERLY / (finally) The first man I ever loved unconditionally... was named Stefan.
 BEVERLY / He was a soccer player... I would watch him race down the field and I thought my heart would stop because he was so beautiful...
 BEVERLY / We married and had three children... twin boys, Andrew and Alex, and then a girl, Jennifer... Stefan became a famous artist and created huge, breathtaking metal sculptures... I kept house and made the world easy for him... and he came to adore me as much as I worshipped him...
 BEVERLY / At least in my daydreams. Stefan was eleven... and I was eight. He never even knew I existed.
 BEVERLY / Deanna... I loved Odan. I'm sure of that... I had no doubts, no fears... (beat) ... and now... I don't know what it was I loved. His eyes... his hands, his mouth... his body? They're gone. If that was all it was, I should mourn him and go on...
 BEVERLY / But there was so much more... I felt completely free with him... unguarded... at ease with myself... There were so many things that made him special to me. Where are they? Are they still here... alive in Will Riker? I look at Will and I see someone I've known for years... a kind of brother. But... inside... is it really Odan... ?
 BEVERLY / Help me, Deanna... please...
 TROI / What... what do your feelings tell you?
 BEVERLY / I feel the pull... it's powerful...
 BEVERLY / I wish he'd never come on this ship... I was happy tending patients and doing my research...
 TROI / Don't wish that, Beverly... you can never be open to love if you won't risk pain...
 BEVERLY / I don't care... I'd give anything not to feel the way I do now... there's no happiness that's worth this...
 BEVERLY / He's here. He just walked in.
 TROI / Look at him.
 BEVERLY / I don't want to look at him... Talk to me Deanna, please... keep talking.
 TROI / The first man I ever loved... was my father. He was strong and tall... he carried me when the ground was muddy... he chased away the monsters who hid under my bed at night... he sang to me and he kept me safe. And then he went away.
 TROI / What I wouldn't give to hear his songs again... to feel his arms protect me. I never will. But I can still feel his warmth, his love... as though he were here with me. (Beverly acknowledges) Beverly, if you can feel those things from the man we know as Will Riker, accept them, accept the love.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44823.8. Representative of the moons of Peliar Zel have agreed to come on board to meet the new Ambassador Odan.
 BEVERLY / White count is elevated... it's higher every time I read it... (beat) Are you in pain?
 RIKER / (lying) Not much...
 PICARD / Ambassador... I can stall the representatives...
 RIKER / No. They would consider it deception. I must meet them.
 PICARD / Surely... to present yourself in this condition... will not help our cause.
 RIKER / I promise you, Captain... they will not know I am ill.
 WORF / Captain... the emissaries.
 RIKER / Lathal Bine... It was your aunt who represented Beta thirty years ago...
 RIKER / A formidable woman. I had the utmost respect for her.
 RIKER / It was you, of course, Kalin Trose. Then you were a young man, bristling with passion and zeal... (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / But wise enough to see that your people needed peace to ensure their future...
 RIKER / They agreed to trade places for a week... understand each other's situation with more informed eyes... after that -- an agreement came swiftly.
 RIKER / But it's not commonly known... that during those negotiations... Kalin Trose, you quelled a plot by radicals on your moon to assasinate the Beta delegation.
 RIKER / Do you accept me? Will you allow me to work with you?
 RIKER / And Alpha moon?
 RIKER / Kalin Trose, you may confer with your people. But we must have your answer within eight hours.
 RIKER / Beverly... help me...
 BEVERLY / All his vital functions are overworked. His immune system is under attack. I can only guess that he's going through classic rejection syndrome.
 PICARD / Is there any treatment you can give him?
 BEVERLY / I can administer an immunosuppressant. It would help with the symptoms... but it wouldn't correct the underlying cause. He's carrying a foreign organism in his body.
 BEVERLY / I don't know what to do... medical school didn't exactly prepare me for a situation like this...
 PICARD / You're doing all you can...
 BEVERLY / Thank you. I wish that were more comforting.
 BEVERLY / Don't worry about me, Captain. I'm fine.
 PICARD / Ambassador... when you feel up to it, please join me in my Ready Room.
 BEVERLY / I'm giving you something that should help you feel better. At least temporarily.
 RIKER / The pain is gone... thank you...
 BEVERLY / Please... don't...
 RIKER / Let me touch you... just for a moment...
 BEVERLY / No... please...
 PICARD / It was a fast decision, which we must take as positive. The Alphan representative has agreed... somewhat dubiously... to let you mediate the dispute.
 RIKER / I was sure they would. They are reasonable people... just trapped in their own anger.
 PICARD / I have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if anything goes wrong in your discussions.
 RIKER / (grinning) Then it's up to me to make sure nothing goes wrong.
 RIKER / Have I said something wrong... ?
 PICARD / No... it's just... for a moment... you sounded more like Will Riker.
 PICARD / We have received word that your new host will arrive in eighteen hours. Will you be all right until then?
 RIKER / The medication which Doctor Beverly gave me has helped. I will find a way to keep going.
 RIKER / It is an awkward situation for her. As you can imagine.
 PICARD / Yes. Yes, I certainly can. (beat) And for you as well.
 RIKER / My life has been spent... trying to help others find solutions to insoluble problems. And now... I am confronted with one of my own for which there is truly no answer.
 BEVERLY / Lemon tea...
 RIKER / Computer... location of Doctor Beverly Crusher.
 RIKER / Can you make balso tonic?
 RIKER / Never mind.
 RIKER / Come in...
 BEVERLY / I thought... I should see how you're doing. If you needed another hypospray...
 RIKER / I don't think so... the symptoms have not returned...
 BEVERLY / Ah. Well... that's good.
 RIKER / Yes.
 BEVERLY / Tomorrow is an important day. Do you feel -- ready for it?
 RIKER / I think so. I have been preparing.
 BEVERLY / That's good.
 RIKER / Yes.
 BEVERLY / I'll check your vital signs in the morning... before the representatives get here.
 RIKER / They must not know I'm taking medication...
 BEVERLY / You could arrange to take a series of breaks...
 RIKER / That's good...
 BEVERLY / Yes...
 RIKER / Beverly... I want you...
 RIKER / If you are going to leave... you must go now...
 BEVERLY / I'm not leaving.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 44824.4. The representatives of Peliar Zel and its two moons are ready to transport on board. We have learned that they each have troops massed and are ready for combat if this final effort at peace is not successful.
 BEVERLY / White count is back up... temperature elevated... the effects of the medication are wearing off faster every time. (reaches for her bag) I'll administer one now... and hope it holds for an hour or two...
 RIKER / No... no more.
 PICARD / Ambassador... it's clear you're in pain. You can't get through the next hours without help --
 RIKER / I must.
 BEVERLY / Are the injections damaging the host body... Riker's body?
 RIKER / Yes. I cannot put him at further risk.
 BEVERLY / But how can you function? Conduct the meeting?
 RIKER / I'll manage.
 PICARD / We will respect your wishes.
 RIKER / Further... I will conduct the mediation today... but at the end of today, regardless of the outcome... I must be removed from Riker's body. Even if the new host has not yet arrived.
 BEVERLY / But... you wouldn't survive...
 RIKER / Riker will not survive unless I am removed. He has given enough...
 BEVERLY / Odan...
 RIKER / Your word.
 BEVERLY / Very well.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / Yes, Mister Worf?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / The representatives have arrived. I will escort them to the Observation Lounge.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 BEVERLY / I'll stand by with the medication, just in case. The pain may become so intense --
 PICARD / Beverly...
 PICARD / Whatever else I have been to you... I am your friend. I cannot imagine what you are going through... but it must be a kind of hell. I want you to know... I am here... to help you... in any way I can.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc...
 PICARD / Computer, what time is it?
 BEVERLY / They've been in there almost six hours...
 WORF / Captain... a message from the ship carrying the Trill host...
 BEVERLY / Are they here?
 WORF / No. They are experiencing difficulty. They do not anticipate their arrival for another nine hours.
 BEVERLY / Nine hours...
 PICARD / Ambassador...
 RIKER / It was worth it...
 RIKER / They will not go to war...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, make sure the representatives are safely transported off the ship. (to Conn) Ensign, set a course to intercept the Trill ship. Prepare to go to warp nine.
 DATA / Sir, it could take more than two hours to reach the vessel.
 BEVERLY / I have no choice... I gave my word. I have to remove him. Let's hope we reach the new host in time.
 BEVERLY / Will is all right. His vital signs have stabilized... he's sleeping now.
 PICARD / And... how is Odan?
 BEVERLY / I have placed him in stasis. He's fine for the moment.
 PICARD / You need some rest, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / No. If Odan is to survive, he must be implanted in the host as soon as he arrives. I'll wait here.
 PICARD / It will be some time yet.
 BEVERLY / I know.
 WORF / Doctor...
 BEVERLY / Is the Trill host here?
 WORF / Yes.
 BEVERLY / Thank goodness... bring him in.
 WORF (O.C.) / Doctor...
 BEVERLY / ... the operation to implant Odan into the new host was completed at nineteen hundred hours and appears to have been successful. There have been no difficulties with assimilation...
 BEVERLY / You should be sleeping. You need rest.
 BEVERLY / I congratulate you. You averted a war that would have cost many lives...
 BEVERLY / I'm glad you're all right.
 BEVERLY / Perhaps it is a human failing... but we are not accustomed to these kinds of changes. I can't... keep up. How long will you have this host? What would the next one be? I couldn't live with that kind of uncertainty...
 BEVERLY / Perhaps... someday... our ability to love will not be so limited.
 BEVERLY / Odan...
 BEVERLY / I do love you... please remember that.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / Personal log, Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge, Stardate 44885.5. I am en route to Risa to attend an artificial intelligence seminar. Captain Picard has ordered me to arrive a few days early to have some fun and relax... I intend to follow his orders to the very best of my ability.
 GEORDI / How about some different music, Computer... something with a... Latin beat...
 GEORDI / No... no, a gentle Latin beat... a spanish guitar maybe...
 GEORDI / Perfect...
 GEORDI / What's the weather like on Risa?
 GEORDI / Is that right... how long before we get there?
 GEORDI / Three more hours...
 GEORDI / How about a game, computer...
 GEORDI / Something to pass the time, you know... a diversion...
 GEORDI / Ah, verbal...
 GEORDI / Begin...
 GEORDI / That's easy --
 GEORDI / (haltingly) Asymmetrical... inverted... phased... stable...
 GEORDI & COMPUTER / ...universal...
 GEORDI / ... yeah, I know. Okay, let me try another one...
 GEORDI / Ah... the aft nacelle associative... the forward saucer associative...
 GEORDI / Computer -- sequence zero one zero. Maximum power to shields. And kill the music...
 GEORDI / Shuttle Seven to Enterprise. I've encountered a Romulan Warbird. Coordinates are three...
 GEORDI / Come in Risa Control... anybody...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44891.6. The Enterprise has been ordered to accompany a special emissary from the Klingon High Council to the Kriosian System where one of their colonies is fighting for independence.
 PICARD and RIKER are listening to the Klingon / Ambassador, KELL.
 PICARD / You are prepared to grant them independence?
 PICARD / If I may ask, Ambassador, what has this to do with us?
 RIKER / Does he have evidence?
 PICARD / (thank-you) K'adlo. I have been pleased to offer occasional assistance to the Klingon people in the past.
 PICARD / I can assure you, Ambassador, the Federation would never interfere with the Empire's internal affairs.
 RIKER / Captain, we'll be in a war zone...
 PICARD / Agreed. Ambassador, I will ask our chief security officer, Lieutenant Worf, to report to you for a full...
 PICARD / (firm) Mister Worf is my security chief and my tactical officer. This matter clearly falls within his jurisdiction.
 GEORDI / I can tell you've gone to a lot of trouble.
 GEORDI / Don't count on it.
 GEORDI / Hey!
 GEORDI / Show me something? That should be an interesting trick since I can't see anything without the VISOR.
 GEORDI / (tight, desperation showing) Why... are you doing this?
 WOMAN / Will there be any physical evidence of what you are doing to him?
 WOMAN / How will we be certain your procedure has been successful?
 WORF / Both were engaged near the Ikalian asteroid belt... that is where the rebels must be hiding...
 WORF / They might attack a freighter but I doubt they would challenge a Federation starship.
 WORF / (eye to eye) You would test the Captain's word with me, Kell? Is it because I have no honor in your eyes that you expect me to be disloyal?
 WORF / Captain Picard does not lie. If he says there is no Federation assistance to the rebels, there is none.
 WORF / He will not disappoint you. If that is all...
 WORF / Thank me?
 WORF / My motives were personal. Not political.
 GEORDI / In Ten Forward.
 GEORDI / That's Chief O'Brien.
 GEORDI / Almost four years.
 GEORDI / Okay.
 GEORDI / I... I don't...
 GEORDI / Kill Chief O'Brien.
 GEORDI / Chief?
 GEORDI / Mind if I join you guys?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 44896.9. We are orbiting Krios, awaiting our first meeting with the Klingon Governor. Commander La Forge has rejoined the Enterprise from Risa.
 DATA / Welcome back, Geordi. How was the seminar?
 GEORDI / Very informative, Data. I'll tell you all about it.
 DATA / It is fortunate we were able to coordinate your return on the Teldarian cruiser...
 GEORDI / Yeah, when I heard the Enterprise had been ordered to the Krios system... (joking) I thought I might be forced to endure another couple of weeks on Risa...
 DATA / I am sorry to hear you did not enjoy yourself.
 GEORDI / I was joking...
 DATA / Joking. Ah. "Forced to endure" Risa. Your actual intent was to emphasize that you did enjoy yourself. I see how that could be considered quite amusing.
 PICARD / Commander La Forge...
 GEORDI / (smiling, with humor) Permission to come aboard, sir.
 PICARD / Granted. Welcome back.
 PICARD / Ambassador Kell, this is my Chief Engineer.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge has been attending a seminar...
 PICARD / (continuing) .. on artificial intelligence on Risa...
 RIKER / I'm glad we got you back, Geordi...
 RIKER / (continuing) ... we're going to need you on this.
 GEORDI / Data tells me the Federation has been accused of aiding the Kriosian rebels...
 PICARD / We're to be presented with evidence today... we'll need your help in analyzing it...
 GEORDI / Anything I can do...
 TROI / (stating a fact) You had a good time...
 GEORDI / Can you tell?
 TROI / You're more relaxed than I've ever seen you.
 WORF / Captain, Governor Vagh has signaled that he is ready to meet with you.
 PICARD / Very well. Advise him that we will transport to the surface immediately. (then to Kell) Ambassador...
 DATA / Commander Riker.
 RIKER / What is it, Data?
 DATA / Our sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in the E-band.
 RIKER / E-band? That's unusual. What's the source?
 DATA / Unknown. E-band emissions are difficult to localize.
 RIKER / Collapsing protostars sometimes emit E-band bursts, don't they?
 DATA / Yes, sir. However, there are no protostars in this sector.
 RIKER / You'd better run a scan. Keep me posted.
 PICARD / (a frown) Governor, what exactly do you believe the Federation has done?
 RIKER / We make no effort to restrict access to our medical supplies.
 PICARD / No, they are not.
 PICARD / This was captured from the rebels?
 RIKER / (as he takes rifle) It does seem to be Federation issue.
 PICARD / With your permission, Governor, I would like to take that weapon back to the Enterprise and verify its origin.
 PICARD / Even if these weapons do prove genuine, I assure you some third party is involved. The Federation is not in the business of arming rebellions.
 PICARD / You speak as if we were enemies, Governor, not allies.
 PICARD / Qu'vath guy'cha b'aka.
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Picard to Enterprise. Three to transport.
 GEORDI / Red Torian.
 GEORDI / My glass... slipped.
 GEORDI / You're soaked.
 GEORDI / Let me get you something to wipe that off with...
 DATA / Energy flow is within normal parameters... from the prefire chamber... to the emission aperture.
 GEORDI / Rapid nadion pulse is right on target... beam control assembly, safety interlock, both check out.
 GEORDI / Beam width and intensity controls also responding correctly.
 DATA / Energy cell usage remains constant at one-point-oh-five megajoules per second.
 DATA / Curious, the efficiency reading on the discharge crystal is well above Starfleet specifications.
 GEORDI / Yeah... by quite a bit... ninety-four point one percent efficiency.
 DATA / Our most efficient discharge crystal typically fires with eighty-six point five percent efficiency.
 GEORDI / Let's take a closer look at the wave pattern on the emission beam. That might tell us why it's losing so little energy.
 DATA / Pulse frequency out of prefire chamber reads steady.
 GEORDI / There... that's not right... the initial output spike is inverted...
 DATA / That might suggest that the weapon has been charged with a forced pulse... well into the terahertz range.
 GEORDI / Then it's definitely not Starfleet issue... and there can't be that many systems that use terahertz feeds...
 DATA / Three hundred twenty-seven, to our knowledge. We can probably achieve an exact match with a random computer search. It will take approximately three hours.
 GEORDI / I think we could narrow the list down with a little common sense, Data... ask yourself who has the most to gain from a conflict between the Klingon Empire and the Federation?
 GEORDI / -- the Romulans.
 GEORDI / They fashioned a perfect Federation rifle... but they had to charge it from their energy sources. So the discharge crystal and the emission beam pattern correspond to those you'd find in a Romulan disrupter.
 PICARD / But they do have an interest in driving the Federation and the Empire apart. Our alliance is the only thing that keeps them in check.
 PICARD / of course. My staff will provide their full cooperation.
 RIKER / (responding mid-conversation) Another E-band blip?
 DATA / Yes, sir. However, the difference in intensity indicates this one did not originate from the same location as the first.
 RIKER / If it's changed intensity... it can't possibly be a protostar.
 DATA / That is a reasonable assumption.
 RIKER / Is there any known instance of Romulans using the E-band for communications?
 DATA / Not to my knowledge.
 RIKER / (pondering) Is there any way to track the source?
 DATA / We can re-configure the primary sensor arrays. If we narrow their focus to scan for E-band emissions, we might be able to calculate a directional vector. But only if there are more occurrences.
 RIKER / Do it.
 GEORDI / Computer... re-route the power flow in the Cargo Bay Four transporter through the auxiliary replicator system.
 GEORDI / Initiate protocol three six four dash B.
 GEORDI / Recognize La Forge theta-two-nine-nine-seven.
 GEORDI / Now... redirect transporter mode to the planetary sensor array.
 GEORDI / Verify that all record of these modifications are being erased from each directory.
 WORF / Sir, we are being hailed by Governor Vagh.
 PICARD / (standing) On screen, Mister Worf.
 PICARD / Governor...
 PICARD / I don't understand.
 PICARD / Governor, I assure you that --
 WORF / (reacting to his board) Klingon Attack Cruiser uncloaking, sir.
 WORF / Two Birds of Prey approaching.
 DATA / Sensors confirm an unauthorized transporter beam was initiated at eleven twenty three hours.
 PICARD / Do you know which transporter was used?
 GEORDI / Afraid not, sir. Whoever did it apparently used the planetary array to bypass the transport sensors.
 RIKER / What about the transporter logs?
 GEORDI / They're blank.
 RIKER / How many people on board are capable of doing this, Geordi?
 GEORDI / I'm not even sure how it was done yet... when I find out, maybe I can give you an answer... not many, that's for sure...
 RIKER / How long do we have?
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, your recommendations?
 GEORDI / It might be possible to locate the point of origin by tracing power flows at the time of transport.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / The primary plasma system does not indicate a power drain from any transporter...
 GEORDI / Then whoever used the transporter must have bypassed the primary feeds.
 DATA / Tracking power through the secondary systems... (beat, more lines disappear) No surges to transporters are indicated.
 GEORDI / Damn, who could have pulled this off... ? (beat, thoughtfully) Try life support power flow.
 DATA / No abnormal surges indicated.
 GEORDI / The replicator waveguides?
 GEORDI / There... that's not a replicator energy pattern... trace it...
 DATA / Cargo Bay Four.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Worf. Security to Cargo Bay Four.
 GEORDI / This has to be the transfer point.
 DATA / Perhaps the perpetrator reprogrammed the memory chips... to erase any record.
 WORF / Which members of the crew could have done that?
 GEORDI / I think I could have managed it, if I put my mind to it. The Chief here, Data, Lieutenant Costa... that's about it.
 WORF / (reluctant) Procedure requires that I ask each of you where you were at eleven twenty three hours.
 DATA / I was on the Bridge at my station.
 GEORDI / (shrugs) I was in my quarters...
 WORF / Was anyone with you?
 GEORDI / No, I was alone.
 GEORDI / Costa was on duty in Engineering... I'm sure he has twenty witnesses...
 WORF / Then there is someone on board who is not what he seems to be.
 GEORDI / Chief... let's do a detailed scan on every chip in this assembly. (beat) There's got to be some kind of trail we can follow.
 PICARD / The isolinear chips were definitely altered?
 GEORDI / (acknowledging) Programmed to erase all operator commands once the transfer was complete.
 DATA / The erasures were complete. However, an analysis of the subatomic structure revealed almost undetectable residual patterns. (beat) In time, we may be able to reconstruct the perpetrator's authorization code.
 GEORDI / No, sir. Everyone who has the necessary skills also has an alibi. (beat) Except for me, that is. I was alone in my quarters.
 PICARD / Our forensic team is trying to identify anyone who might have been in Cargo Bay Four today...
 GEORDI / It's not going to be easy. There were a lot of people in and out of there.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Data.
 DATA / Yes, Commander.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Sensors have picked up another E-band emission.
 DATA / Acknowledged, I will be there shortly.
 DATA / We have been picking up a curious intermittent blip... Commander Riker has speculated that it may be a Romulan transmission. I am attempting to track its source.
 PICARD / Proceed... thank you, Mister La Forge...
 PICARD / Assure him that we are doing everything possible. (beat) And advise him that if necessary I will defend my ship...
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / Do you think he would come?
 PICARD / Qapla'.
 GEORDI / I understand.
 GEORDI / La Forge to O'Brien. (beat) O'Brien?
 GEORDI / Nothing... nothing at all, Chief. Sorry I bothered you.
 BEVERLY / You couldn't sleep at all?
 GEORDI / I was restless... kept waking up...
 BEVERLY / There is a minor vascular irregularity in the visual cortex; a slight dilation of the blood vessels. It doesn't seem serious. (a beat as she thinks about it) What about your VISOR? Has it been giving you any problems?
 GEORDI / (shakes head) No... nothing unusual.
 BEVERLY / It might not be a bad idea to have your VISOR examined when we get to Starbase Thirty-Six next month.
 GEORDI / Okay. Sure.
 BEVERLY / In the meantime... this somnetic inducer will help you sleep. Just put it by your bed.
 GEORDI / (unconvincing) Thanks, Doc... I'm sure I'll be fine...
 PICARD / Energize.
 PICARD / Governor Vagh... thank you for coming.
 PICARD / Of course.
 RIKER / (reacting) From inside the Enterprise? You're sure?
 DATA / The first and third E-band blips were clearly generated on board the ship. The second came from the planet's surface.
 RIKER / Generated by what?
 DATA / Unknown, sir.
 RIKER / (a thoughtful beat) Mister Data, we know we have a spy on board... and now we have unexplained signals on board. I'd say it's a reasonable guess they're related somehow, wouldn't you?
 DATA / Yessir, one could easily speculate that the E-band is being used for some form of covert communication.
 RIKER / We need more than speculation, we need to know who, what, where, when and why. Soon, Mister Data... or we may be going to war.
 DATA / Yessir.
 DATA / Computer, run an analysis of all known Romulan transmission formats, all bands... identify any commonalities with displayed waveform.
 DATA / Does this waveform match that of any known communication format?
 DATA / Broaden search pattern beyond communications. Does the waveform displayed conform to any natural phenomena, cryptographic formats or lifeform E-M emissions?
 DATA / (reacts) As in a human brainwave pattern?
 DATA / What kind of receiver would be capable of processing these signals?
 DATA / (keys insignia) Computer... link with the shuttle's on board system. Access the isolinear storage assembly.
 DATA / Scan all chips which contain mission logs. Note any discrepancies...
 DATA / Perform a level-5 diagnostic of the Shuttle's power and navigational systems.
 DATA / Scan the shuttle's structural integrity.
 DATA / Probable cause of these variations... ?
 GEORDI / What can I do for you, Chief?
 GEORDI / (beat, glances at Vagh) Sure. Sure, let's take a look.
 DATA / Computer... I'm reading anomalous variations in the molecular structure of these memory chips... please confirm...
 DATA / Probable cause?
 DATA / Compare variations with established Romulan replication patterns.
 GEORDI / (mid-discussion) ... and we ought to run a level-1 diagnostic on the phase transition coils.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to La Forge.
 DATA / (continuing) Report, please.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Geordi... come in...
 DATA / Computer... present location of Commander La Forge?
 DATA / (keys insignia) Data to Lieutenant Worf.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Priority One.
 WORF / Go ahead.
 DATA / Take Commander La Forge into custody immediately.
 WORF / Sir?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / That is an order.
 PICARD / (in background to Vagh) Our forensic teams are collecting DNA samples... by tracing biochemical signatures, we'll be able to determine who has been in this bay recently...
 PICARD / I'm not certain we can. But at the very least we will narrow the list of suspects... and as we continue to check each one's alibi...
 WORF / La Forge!
 PICARD / Get him out of here.
 PICARD / Governor, if I could explain this... I would.
 DATA (O.S.) / I think I can help, Captain...
 DATA / I have been able to determine that Commander La Forge was abducted by Romulans while en route to Risa. It is likely that they somehow forced him into taking part in their plot to assassinate Governor Vagh.
 DATA / No, sir, you did not. I do not think the Commander is acting on his own accord. He has been receiving E-band signals through his VISOR... signals which I believe are carrying direct commands to his brain. (beat) I have surmised that Commander La Forge was conditioned by the Romulans -- a process referred to historically, and somewhat inaccurately, as brainwashing.
 PICARD / The Romulans have always wanted to destroy the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons. Had Mister La Forge killed you, Governor, I think you would agree, they might very well have succeeded.
 WORF / Who sent these signals? A cloaked Romulan ship?
 DATA / No, that would not be possible. The signals had to be transmitted in close proximity to the VISOR.
 PICARD / Then you're suggesting that a Romulan accomplice was in close proximity to La Forge whenever he received the signals...
 DATA / Yes, sir, I am.
 DATA / I have narrowed the list of possibilities to two people... the only two people who were with Commander La Forge all three times a transmission was recorded. Captain Picard and Ambassador Kell.
 DATA / One of them may be concealing an E-band transmitter. If they would agree to be searched...
 PICARD / I will certainly grant you asylum, Ambassador, as soon as you are absolved of this crime.
 GEORDI / I was on Risa. I took long walks every morning... I went to the beach, I swam...
 TROI / And if I told you that you never went to Risa at all...
 GEORDI / (scared laugh) But I went in the ocean... the water was so salty I can still taste it... no, it's just not possible... find a woman named Jonek... we spent a lot of time together... she'll tell you...
 TROI / There was no Jonek, you never swam in the ocean...
 GEORDI / But I remember... everything. Like one night there was this Andorian waiter who couldn't get our orders right. He brought us a Klingon dinner... and it was still moving.
 GEORDI / It did happen. I remember it.
 TROI / I know you do. Just take that memory... and put it aside for a moment... and tell me what you remember about the shuttle craft trip after you left the Enterprise...
 GEORDI / I was just trying to get in the mood... played a little music... talked to the computer... you know how it is on a long trip...
 TROI / And when you saw the Romulan ship did you try to call for help?
 GEORDI / Well, the first thing I did... wait a minute, that's...
 TROI / It will take time, Geordi... a long time, but we will reconstruct your memory... together.
 GEORDI / (beat, scared) I'm... not sure... of anything.
 TROI / Believe it or not, that's a good sign... a beginning. Now, go back again to the shuttle... There was a Romulan ship... and the first thing you did was... ?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 44932.3 The Enterprise is preparing to enter the Mar Oscura, an unexplored dark matter nebula first identified over a century ago.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Commander Data is modifying several of our photon torpedos for an experiment designed to elicit more information about this unusual phenomenon.
 DATA / The initial dispersal pattern should not be more than seven kilometers in diameter.
 DATA / That should suffice. (beat) Is there something occupying your thoughts, Jenna? You are somewhat subdued today...
 DATA / Was the experience as emotionally problematic as last week's encounter?
 DATA / What was your response?
 DATA / As you requested, I must now remind you of the reasons you decided to end your relationship with Jeff.
 DATA / You objected to the fact that Jeff seemed unwilling to set aside sufficient time for you. You said he never did... the little things. He was unresponsive. You disliked the sound he made when he ate his soup...
 DATA / This is the third time I have refreshed your memory. Do you wish to rescind our agreement?
 DATA / Many lovers throughout history have had similar difficulties. Anne Boleyn was quite distressed that Henry the Eighth preferred the company of his huntsmen to that of his wife.
 DATA / Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff dissolved your relationship, I saw an excellent opportunity to study that aspect of human intimacy. Also, I believed it was my obligation to do so.
 DATA / I anticipated this would be a difficult period for you. As your friend, it is my responsibility to be supportive in times of need.
 DATA / (hits communicator) Data to Bridge. We are ready for the first illumination test.
 RIKER in Command, ENSIGN MCKNIGHT at Con, WORF at / Tactical.
 RIKER / (to com) Acknowledged. All science stations stand by... we're about to light up the nebula. Mister Worf?
 WORF / (reading console) Launch bay one shows ready, Commander.
 RIKER / Fire torpedo.
 DATA / Is anything wrong?
 DATA / I do not believe that is so. Your rhythmic control has improved markedly. I heard no fluctuations during the performance.
 DATA / The contrapuntal nature of the composition is quite demanding. We will give the rhythmic patterns more attention in our next rehearsal. (beat) However, I am quite certain that the audience was oblivious to such nuances. They seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly.
 DATA / I believe I observed that you seem to have an aversion to orderliness... but it was not intended as a humorous remark...
 DATA / And a very good job of it I did, too.
 PICARD / Report, Mister Data.
 DATA / I am nearly finished compiling the readings from our most recent illuminatory burst. They differ considerably from surveys of similar nebulae.
 PICARD / How so?
 DATA / Dark matter density is nearly one order of magnitude higher than previously found. (beat) Lifeforms here may have developed in ways never before observed.
 RIKER / (to Data) Interesting hypothesis. Are there any M-Class planets we could check out?
 DATA / Several, Sir. The nearest is approximately three light years from our present position.
 PICARD / It's worth a look. We'll continue with our survey along the way. (to McKnight) Ensign, get the planet's coordinates from Commander Data and plot a course, three quarters impulse.
 BEVERLY and a NURSE are standing at the large wall / monitor, running a complex experiment.
 BEVERLY / (to Nurse) Let's increase the flow rate -- see if that helps.
 DATA / Children often do not develop a discerning palette until well beyond adolescence.
 DATA / The unidirectional nature of the time continuum makes that an unlikely possibility.
 DATA / That is not true. I have no human feelings.
 DATA / (straight) Permission granted.
 DATA / Eighty-seven percent Saurian Brandy... Targ milk and Denevian mead comprise the rest... an unusually high concentration of mono-saccharides and fructose compounds.
 DATA / Ensign D'Sora just gave me what could be considered a very... passionate kiss in the Torpedo Bay.
 DATA / I cannot feel because---
 DATA / I was... intrigued. Jenna seemed to be displaying genuine affection toward me.
 DATA / I calculated that Jenna's actions to date would tend to support the supposition that she wishes to initiate a non-platonic mutually exclusive relationship.
 DATA / I find her to be a competent officer... highly motivated... lacking somewhat in her understanding of the theory underlying dilithium matrix applications---
 DATA / I have become... used to her.
 DATA / I do not know. Clearly, an ongoing intimate relationship is an option. However, I am inexperienced in such matters. I require advice.
 DATA / But I am incapable of love.
 GEORDI'S VOICE / Missing someone?
 GEORDI / I found Spot wandering through the corridor two sections away.
 DATA / (puzzled) Thank you.
 GEORDI / Forget to secure the door when you left?
 DATA / The door sensor has been programmed to recognize only humanoid forms for entry or egress. Spot could not have triggered the mechanism.
 GEORDI / Maybe someone came in while you were away and let him out by accident. Has anything been disturbed?
 DATA / (looks around very quickly) No. (to com) Computer, has anyone entered my quarters in the last twelve hours other than myself or Commander La Forge?
 GEORDI / That's pretty strange... we should report a possible unauthorized entry to security, just to be on the safe side.
 DATA / Geordi, may I ask your advice concerning a... personal matter?
 GEORDI / Sure, Data.
 DATA / Should I pursue a relationship with Ensign D'Sora?
 DATA / (prompting) Ensign Jenna D'Sora. Serial number CL-10928---
 GEORDI / Yeah, I know who she is. I thought she and Jeff Arton...
 DATA / They discontinued their association. Now she has made the... first move in initiating a relationship with me. (beat) What should I do?
 GEORDI / Hmmm... if she just ended a bad situation... sometimes it takes people a while... but if they jump into another relationship --
 GEORDI / (continuing) ... see, that can be a problem... unless, of course, she is ready... and then it depends if you're really serious. It's uh... kind of complicated.
 GEORDI / (after a beat) My advice to you is... to ask someone else for advice. Someone with a little more experience in these things.
 TROI and Data sitting. / 
 TROI / I think you should be careful. This is not some experiment you're running. Jenna is a living, breathing person with needs and feelings that have to be considered.
 DATA / Then you believe I should not pursue this any further.
 TROI / No, I didn't say that... I just want you to be aware that this will be unlike any other... more casual relationship that you've attempted.
 DATA / I have studied a great deal of human literature on the subject of love and romantic liaisons. There are many role models for me to emulate.
 TROI / Ultimately, Jenna will care for you because of what you are. Not what you imitate out of a book.
 DATA / My programming may be inadequate to the task.
 TROI / We're all more than the sum of our parts, Data. You'll have to be more than the sum of your programming.
 WORF / Klingons do not... pursue relationships. They conquer that which they desire.
 WORF / (continuing) However... (quietly, with meaning) Ensign D'Sora serves under my command. If she were... mistreated, I would be very... displeased.
 DATA / I understand.
 RIKER / I think you should pursue it. First of all, she's a beautiful woman who seems to be crazy about you.
 DATA / Jenna has clearly demonstrated how she feels about me. But I am not capable of returning those feelings.
 RIKER / I'm sure she's aware of that. (beat) Data, when you get involved with another person, there's always a risk. Of disappointment. Of getting hurt.
 DATA / I cannot get hurt. But she can.
 RIKER / Jenna knows that. And she's obviously decided to take the chance. Data, when it really works between two people, it's like nothing you've ever experienced -- the rewards are far beyond simple friendship.
 DATA / How far beyond, sir?
 RIKER / Well, that's what I hope you're about to find out.
 DATA / Thank you, Commander.
 DATA / Captain, I am seeking advice in---
 PICARD / Yes, I've heard, Data... and I would be delighted to offer you any advice I have on understanding women. (beat) As soon as I have some, I'll let you know.
 DATA (V.O.) / Second Officer's personal log, Stardate 44935.6. After conferring with my colleagues regarding the nature of romantic love in general, and my own situation in particular, I have reached a decision.
 DATA / Crystilia. Their fragrance is an evolutionary response to the acrid nature of the atmosphere on Telemarius Three.
 DATA / It seems that your quarters have reverted to their earlier state of disorder.
 DATA / It was Commander Riker who suggested this particular flower. He said that it had worked for him in the past.
 DATA / No. In actuality, less than one percent of the Enterprise crew was involved. It was necessary to balance theory with experiential referents. Both are required for a program of this nature. (to Computer) Computer, decrease illumination level by one third standard lux.
 DATA / Yes. One which I have just created for romantic relationships.
 DATA / You are much more than that, Jenna. I have written a subroutine specifically for you -- a program within the program. I have devoted a considerable share of my internal resources to its development.
 PICARD / Estimated time of arrival, Mister Data?
 DATA / We will reach the M class planet in approximately eleven hours.
 PICARD / You have the Bridge, Number One.
 PICARD / (keying insignia) Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / Step into my Ready Room, please. And bring a tricorder.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, Sir.
 WORF / Captain?
 PICARD / What do you make of this?
 WORF / I am puzzled, Sir.
 PICARD / So am I, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Captain, the only detectable bioelectric residuals are your own. (a beat) You did not --
 PICARD / -- No. I did not.
 PICARD / (continuing) It seems we have a poltergeist.
 WORF / Sir?
 PICARD / A mischievous spirit.
 WORF / (understanding) Hoq-JoH.
 PICARD / (beat) Perhaps this is some kind of practical joke.
 WORF / (taken aback) Sir?
 PICARD / Perhaps not.
 WORF / I cannot explain how an intruder could have entered this room... I recommend we go to Red Alert.
 PICARD / Not yet.
 WORF / Then I will order one of my officers to stand watch. (keys insignia) Worf to Ensign --
 PICARD / (cutting him off) -- That's alright, Mister Worf. For now, I think circumstances warrant our caution -- nothing more.
 WORF / (reluctantly) As you wish, Captain.
 DATA / Enter.
 DATA / You are correct. I did not anticipate your arrival until nineteen hundred hours.
 DATA / You have often expressed dissatisfaction with the Spartan nature of my quarters. Is this an attempt at embellishment?
 DATA / (looking around) Spot?
 DATA / Its line is both fluid and formal, yet retains an unpremeditated quality. The tactility of the surface enrichment is evocative of the neo-primitive period in Tyrinean blade carving.
 DATA / Alright.
 DATA / (looks up) Yes?
 DATA / My literature search was apparently incomplete. I discovered twenty-nine books with that title, but none contained that particular admonition.
 DATA / I should not have resumed my painting?
 DATA / Despite your suggestion that I continue?
 DATA / The nature of our interactions is considerably more subtle and complex than I had anticipated. I have much to learn.
 DATA / Perhaps if I looked for a suitable place to display it.
 DATA / The ambient light in this location accentuates its contours.
 DATA / (continuing) However, a gift should not necessarily be placed according to aesthetic criteria. A more central location will carry added meaning.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard. You're needed on the Bridge.
 PICARD / (to COM) Acknowledged.
 RIKER / We've reached the designated coordinates.
 RIKER / (continuing) But the M-Class planet... it's gone.
 PICARD / Are you sure there was no malfunction in the sensors?
 DATA / No, sir. Lateral EM scanners registered radiation indicative of an M-Class planet.
 WORF / Sir!
 PICARD / (to Data) Mister Data, run a complete systems diagnostic --
 WORF / (looks up puzzled) I am not registering a hull breach.
 PICARD / Scan for lifeforms.
 WORF / (scanning) None, Sir.
 RIKER / (to Computer) Computer, boost the structural integrity field around the hull by one hundred percent.
 DATA / (off instruments) Captain. Standard air pressure has been reestablished in the Observation lounge.
 PICARD / Let's have a look.
 WORF / Captain.
 WORF / (frustrated) I do not understand.
 RIKER / Data, are you picking up anything?
 DATA / I detect no unusual readings.
 DATA / (continuing) Curious. The transparent aluminum alloy of this window is exhibiting a pattern of transient electrical currents.
 PICARD / Explanation?
 DATA / I have none. The rate is characteristic of a subspace distortion. But I am not picking up evidence of subspace fields.
 PICARD / We will hold position while we seek an explanation for these anomalies. Divert all resources to that end.
 DATA / Hi, honey, I am home.
 DATA / Negative. We performed a full systems diagnostic and found no malfunctions.
 DATA / Can I get you a drink, dear?
 DATA / Excellent choice. I shall join you.
 DATA / Two Calaman Sherries. (to Jenna) Would you like some dinner as well?
 DATA / Whatever you like, dear.
 DATA / Darling, you remain as aesthetically pleasing as the day we first met. I believe I am the most fortunate sentient in this sector of the galaxy.
 DATA / Now... you must relax. Put your feet up. I will take care of everything.
 DATA / I could organize your closets. I have found that by grouping apparel first by function, and then by color from light to dark, one can more easily locate one's desired choice.
 DATA / But I am happy to do it.
 DATA / What would you like, dear? Am I not paying enough attention to you?
 DATA / Perhaps I have not given you enough compliments. Your hair is looking particularly silky tonight...
 DATA / Am I not behaving as a solicitous mate?
 DATA / Tending to your every need?
 DATA / My most recent self-diagnostic revealed no malfunctions. Perhaps something is wrong with you.
 DATA / (still "angry") You may not tell me how I should behave. You are not my mother.
 DATA / "You are not my mother." Is that not an appropriate response to your statement that I am behaving foolishly?
 DATA / (calm) You do not wish to continue our... lovers quarrel?
 DATA / In my study of interpersonal dynamics, I learned that conflict followed by emotional release often strengthens a connection between two people.
 DATA / With respect to romantic relationships, there is no... real me. I am drawing upon various literary and cultural sources to help define my role.
 DATA / At that particular moment, I was reconfiguring the warp field parameters, analyzing the collected works of Charles Dickens, calculating the maximum pressure I could safely apply to your lips, considering a new food supplement for Spot...
 RIKER / (re: viewscreen) A complete sensor scan of the planet and three survey probes turned up no surprises. No sign of life, nothing out of the ordinary.
 RIKER / (re: viewscreen) A complete sensor scan of the planet and three survey probes turned up no surprises. No sign of life, nothing out of the ordinary.
 WORF / Seven more unusual incidents have been reported. No casualties or damage.
 DATA / At present, we can only state that a subspace effect seems to exist within this nebula. After I have made further analysis, I may be able to adjust the ship's sensors to locate and identify the anomaly.
 RIKER / (to Picard) The ship is at risk as long as we're sitting here. We can always continue our investigation from outside the nebula.
 PICARD / Agreed. Ensign McKnight, plot the most direct course. Ahead warp one.
 PICARD / Engage...
 DATA / (standing back) Captain.
 WORF / (off instruments) Captain! Explosive decompression on Deck Thirty-seven!
 RIKER / Bridge to La Forge... damage report.
 GEORDI / We're showing damage between decks -- we haven't localized it yet.
 GEORDI / Thorne!
 GEORDI / La Forge to Bridge... a cryogenic control conduit just blew out on us. I almost lost a man...
 PICARD / Full stop!
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Bridge...
 PICARD / Yes, Commander?
 GEORDI / (to Comm) I think we have some structural damage between Decks Thirty-Six and Seven. We're checking it out now.
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (to one engineer) Van Mayter, you take access tube twenty-three M and look at the the Bridge connectors.
 GEORDI / I'll cover the aft section. You go---
 DATA / During the series of events, I was able to measure the W particle inference which confirms one of my hypotheses.
 DATA / The unusual preponderance of dark matter in this nebula is causing small gaps in the fabric of normal space.
 DATA / As the Enterprise moves through the nebula, it collides with these deformations.
 PICARD / Like a carriage bouncing over a series of potholes.
 DATA / That is an apt analogy.
 GEORDI / So every time we hit one, part of the ship momentarily phases out of normal space.
 DATA / (acknowledging) Or when one of them hits us. My readings suggest that the deformations themselves are in motion.
 RIKER / We're lucky one of these pockets didn't pass through a photon torpedo casing... or the matter_anti-matter containment pods.
 PICARD / The question now is, how do we get out? Mister Data, can you reconfigure the sensors to detect these anomalies?
 DATA / Yes, sir, but they can only be perceived at extremely close range. Even at minimal speed, it would be impossible to maneuver the Enterprise quickly enough to avoid them.
 WORF / A shuttlecraft is more maneuverable...
 RIKER / He's right.
 RIKER / If we positioned a shuttle far enough in front of the Enterprise... it could detect the pockets and provide us enough time to maneuver out of the way.
 GEORDI / We could give the shuttle control of our navigational systems -- that way, the corresponding maneuvers would be virtually instantaneous.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 WORF / You are relieved, Ensign.
 RIKER / I'll do my pre-flight once I'm on board.
 PICARD / Not this time, Will.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / I'm going to pilot the shuttle.
 RIKER / Captain... my duty as First Officer is to safeguard the lives on this ship. Including yours. The Enterprise can't afford to lose you, sir. Not in this situation.
 PICARD / I believe our best chance of escaping this situation is for me to pilot that shuttle. (beat) This is my ship, Will. I've got to do it.
 RIKER / (acquiescing) Captain.
 PICARD / Shuttle three to Enterprise, telementry link enabled.
 DATA / Ship's computer is accepting navigational inputs from the shuttle.
 PICARD / Forward sensors are on line. Ensign McKnight, plot a course for the shortest distance out of the nebula.
 PICARD / Point one impulse, Number One.
 RIKER / Acknowledged, Captain. We're right behind you. (to Comm) Riker to O'Brien, lock on to the Captain's communicator. I want to be able to pull him out of there if I have to.
 PICARD / Changing course... new heading two-nine-nine mark zero-two-nine.
 DATA / Main coupling is matching navigational inputs, Captain.
 PICARD / I missed it by less than a thousand meters, Enterprise... Advise your status...
 WORF / (checking his panel) Sensors indicate the deformation passing five hundred meters off the starboard bow. We're clear...
 RIKER / One down, Captain...
 PICARD / Resuming previous course.
 PICARD / Changing course... heading zero seven three, mark -- two-eight-eight...
 PICARD / New heading... two-eight-four mark zero...
 PICARD / Enterprise... I'm losing maneuverability...
 GEORDI / Sensors indicate damage to the shuttle's starboard impulse nacelle, Captain.
 PICARD / I'm reading fluctuations in the thermal control sub-system...
 RIKER / Captain, I'm bringing you back.
 PICARD / Belay that, Number One! I'm re-routing the secondary deuterium supply... switching to manual controls.
 DATA / Transceiver signal is down forty-two percent. Navigational inputs are not registering.
 RIKER / (what next?) Captain, we've lost the link.
 PICARD / You'll have to make course changes manually until we re-establish the connection.
 RIKER / Understood. Get us back on line, Data. Geordi, try boosting the power to the L-U band. And increase the distance between the Enterprise and the shuttle. We're going to need some more room to make manual adjustments.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / How far do we have to go?
 PICARD / New heading... two-nine-nine mark one eight...
 PICARD / Enterprise -- hard starboard!
 WORF / Deformation impact on Deck Fifteen... science section...
 RIKER / Damage?
 WORF / Report coming in, sir... minimal damage.
 PICARD / Hold steady... I've completed the re-routing sequence... do you read my navigational inputs?
 RIKER / Data, do we have the telemetry link back?
 DATA / I have increased sensitivity in the L-U band... it should be sufficient.
 RIKER / Captain, let's try it.
 PICARD / New heading. Two-seven-five mark three nine!
 DATA / Confirmed... the link has been re-established.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, I am still having difficulty controlling the shuttlecraft.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir, your krellide storage cells are losing their charge. Maintaining manual control is gonna get increasingly harder...
 PICARD / Estimated distance to the nebula's perimeter?
 DATA / Four-point-seven million kilometers, sir.
 PICARD / Is there a way to transfer the microfusion thrusters so I can get a power boost?
 DATA / Possibly. If you augment the thruster sequencing so that the inertial dampening fields --
 PICARD / Bearing -- two-seven... make that two-eight-five, mark two-five-five!
 DATA / Commander, the shuttle is out of control. Navigational link is severed.
 RIKER / (to Com) Mister O'Brien -- do you have the Captain's signal?
 DATA / Sir, the shuttle's inertial dampeners have failed. It is breaking up.
 PICARD / (to Com) Now would be a good time, Mister O'Brien...
 RIKER / O'Brien -- did we get him?
 PICARD / I'm a little dizzy, Number One... but none the worse... on my way...
 RIKER / (relieved) Acknowledged, sir.
 DATA / Commander, we are nearing the perimeter -- one million kilometers away.
 RIKER / All right, let's make a run for it.
 RIKER / We're clear of the nebula, sir.
 PICARD / Ensign, plot a course for Starbase Two-Sixty. Warp two. Engage.
 DATA / Enter.
 DATA / (continuing) Hello.
 DATA / Thank you. It is much less Spartan, is it not?
 DATA / Jenna, you are repeating yourself. I have found this to be indicative of mental distraction. Is that a correct assumption in this instance?
 DATA / Then perhaps we should begin our meal. Among humans, a low serum glucose level is often responsible for --
 DATA / What is the subject?
 DATA / Yes?
 DATA / Are you currently experiencing this phenomenon?
 DATA / There does appear to be a recurring motif.
 DATA / It is not?
 DATA / That is... a valid projection.
 DATA / (continuing) It is apparent that my reach has exceeded my grasp in this particular area. I am perhaps not nearly so human as I aspire to become...
 DATA / (continuing, pleasantly) If you are ready to eat, I will bring our meal.
 DATA / If you wish.
 DATA / (continuing) Jenna. Are we no longer... a couple?
 DATA / Then I will delete the appropriate program.
 DATA / Hello, Spot.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 44995.3. We are en route to the Klingon Home World, where I will participate in the installation ceremony of Gowron, the next designated Leader of the High Council.
 WORF is practicing a form of martial art in front of a / large mirror. He is dressed in a workout gi and is practicing a graceful and fluid kata using his bat'telth sword... he's been at this for a while and is disheveled and sweaty.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) This visit should also provide an opportunity for one of my officers to correct... a grave injustice..
 WORF / Enter.
 PICARD ENTERS and Worf is caught off-guard. He is / immediately embarrassed at receiving his captain in this manner.
 PICARD / Am I intruding?
 WORF / No, sir. My apologies, Captain... I can be back in uniform---
 PICARD / That won't be necessary. (beat) I'm not here as your captain. I'm here as the person that stood with you before the High Council... your cha'DIch.
 PICARD / (continuing) We'll arrive at your Home World in less than a day.
 WORF / It is not yet time.
 PICARD / That doesn't sound like the man who came to me a year ago... fiercely determined to return home and clear his father's name... or die trying.
 PICARD / You accepted this... dishonor from the Council in order to hold the Empire together. (beat) The Empire survives. Isn't it time to confront the Council... to regain your family name and let the truth be known?
 WORF / I have been told... that patience is sometimes a more effective weapon than a sword.
 PICARD / Patience is a... human virtue, one which I am proud to see you've taken to heart. But this situation may require a more... Klingon response.
 PICARD / (continuing, frank) Your discommendation is a facade intended to protect men less honorable than you. It is a lie... and lies must be challenged.
 WORF / I have grown... weary of bearing this dishonor...
 PICARD / We will be in orbit around your planet for at least two days... it may be some time before we return again. I would be favorably disposed to grant a leave should you request one.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Picard.
 WORF / (softly) Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / (hits communicator) Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We've been intercepted by the Klingon vessel Bortas. They claim to be our escort.
 WORF / No escort was scheduled.
 RIKER and DATA at their positions. Picard ENTERS. / 
 RIKER / (to Picard) The Bortas is standing by, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Gowron... this is an unexpected pleasure.
 PICARD / Successful?
 PICARD / But Duras died in disgrace. By Klingon tradition, his family should share in that disgrace.
 PICARD / Who speaks for his family now?
 PICARD / And they would claim leadership of the Council?
 PICARD / Then how... ?
 PICARD / I fail to see what I can do to assist...
 PICARD / I am prepared to report to the Council that only you have completed the rite of succession...
 PICARD / That... is beyond my purview.
 PICARD / I will not step outside the traditional role of the arbiter.
 PICARD / I can only assure you that I will deal with any challenge according to Klingon law.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, please escort our guest to the transporter room.
 PICARD / Mister Data, begin monitoring Romulan activity along the Neutral Zone. Have the outpost stations there start sending us their tactical reports.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / The Duras family is preparing to move against Gowron.
 RIKER / Backed by Romulans?
 PICARD / I don't know. But there's too much history between the Duras (note: plural) and the Romulans to discount the possibility.
 WORF / (to Technician) Dismissed.
 WORF / (continuing) I would speak with you.
 WORF / (slow and clear) I am not a traitor.
 WORF / I accepted discommendation to protect the Empire.
 WORF / It was Duras' father who betrayed our people to the Romulans at Khitomer. Not mine.
 WORF / There is.
 WORF / (bitter) His family was too powerful. To expose him would have split the Empire. Instead, the Council chose to blame my father.
 WORF / I believe you are a man of honor, Gowron. (beat) I ask you to restore my family name.
 WORF / But after your Installation...
 WORF / Guinan?
 WORF / You... practice?
 WORF / (hesitates) I... practice at... level fourteen.
 WORF / Not a good bet today.
 WORF / Klingons don't laugh.
 WORF / He's a child. And part human.
 WORF / I don't laugh because I don't feel like laughing.
 WORF / (gritting his teeth, frustrated) Perhaps it says... I do not feel like other Klingons.
 WORF / He is having some... difficulties adjusting to life on Earth.
 WORF / It will not be easy for him...
 PICARD / Come.
 WORF / Captain, I request a leave of absence.
 PICARD / (formally) Mister Worf... request granted.
 WORF / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... (Worf pauses) Qapla!
 PICARD / (softly, to himself) And good luck.
 WORF (V.O.) / Lieutenant Worf, personal log, stardate 44996.1. I have located the Klingon ship on which my brother Kurn serves as captain and have arranged to join him.
 WORF / (agrees) Too long.
 WORF / There is much to discuss. I have asked Gowron to restore our family honor. He has refused.
 WORF / What do you mean?
 WORF / You will... ?
 WORF / How could this be done?
 WORF / No.
 WORF / Gowron has completed the rite of succession... it is our duty to support him.
 WORF / We cannot regain honor by acting dishonorably.
 WORF / (low, deadly) I am the elder brother, Kurn... I speak for our family.
 WORF / We will back Gowron. (beat) But not now. Not yet. We will wait. Until Gowron feels the grasp of his enemies around his throat. Then we will offer him our support. And the price will be the restoration of our family name.
 WORF / Contact me when you have gained their support. (beat) Then I will be ready for Gowron.
 PICARD / (to Council) Qaja plu d'itch jung. La woq you ghir klas qimha. Gowron. Doj hon. Doj hon.
 WOMAN / At least, not yet. But when the time is right... we will deal with the Federation... and Captain Picard.
 WORF / Do you know the strength of our enemies?
 WORF / Gowron is nearly out of options. Soon he will have no choice...
 DATA / Do you also require the original logs recorded during the attack, Lieutenant?
 WORF / (acknowledges) Everything we have on the Khitomer massacre.
 DATA / I can provide you with our analysis of communications between the Khitomer outpost and the Romulan ships; however, for a complete record you will have to contact Starbase Twenty-Four and request---
 PICARD / (interrupting) Mister Worf... have you cancelled your leave?
 WORF / No, sir.
 PICARD / Lieutenant... join me in my ready room.
 PICARD / You are planning to use our files on the Khitomer massacre as evidence against Duras' father?
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... do you not see an inherent conflict of interest...
 WORF / Sir, these records can help me prove that my father was falsely accused of treason.
 PICARD / You are using your position as a Starfleet officer to affect political change on your planet... there could not be a worse compromise of our fundamental principles...
 WORF / Captain... you urged me to fight this battle...
 PICARD / (sighs, frustrated) Yes, I know. I understand your motives, and you know I support your goals, but...
 WORF / Do not tie my hands now... I must be able to prove my father's innocence. The Federation records will do that.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... Mister Worf... (beat, sighs) Mister Worf...
 PICARD / Here I am lecturing you on a conflict of interest while I'm desperately trying to avoid one of my own. Do you think I wish to allow the Duras family to solidify their hold on the Council? Do you think I cannot see the implications for the Federation? And good Lord, Duras tried to have me killed! (beat) All of my instincts... my training... my very being as a Starfleet officer are at odds with my responsibilities as arbiter for the Klingon High Council. (beat) We walk the same tightrope between two worlds... you and I. We must try our very best to keep those worlds clearly separate... or we shall certainly fall.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / As far as these records from Khitomer are concerned...
 PICARD / (continuing) I will make the Federation records on the Khitomer massacre available... to anyone who wants them... the High Council, the Duras family... anyone.
 WORF / (very pleased) Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, this is as far as I can go.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (to com) Yes, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / There's a message coming in for you from the surface. It's coded personal.
 PICARD / Send it through.
 PICARD / Yes... thank you.
 PICARD / Nothing would be served by killing the arbiter before his decision.
 PICARD / Your invitation was... unexpected.
 PICARD / That... pleases me.
 PICARD / I am pursuing it with all due vigilance.
 PICARD / The remaining issue then is to see if he has the support of the law.
 PICARD / I'll tell you what I see. If I find Toral's challenge valid, the two of you will very quickly gain control of the Council... and Gowron will be found dead shortly thereafter. If I reject Toral's challenge, you will accuse me of doing it only to serve Federation interests. It will give you a rallying cry to declare war and overthrow Gowron.
 PICARD / You have manipulated the circumstances, ladies, with the skill of a Romulan. (beat) My decision will be announced at high sun tomorrow. Excellent tea. Good day.
 PICARD / K'tal, this Council knows the law of heredity well. G'now juk Hol pajhard. A son will share in the honors or crimes of his father. Toral is Duras' son... that has been established by the genetic scan. And it is heartwarming to see him embraced by the family of Duras... for they are an old and noble family. (beat) But with due respect to the traditions and laws of this High Council, there is no basis for accepting a petition for leadership from a boy who has fought no battles, shed no blood for his people, earned no honor for himself. Perhaps some day he shall. But not now.
 PICARD / (continuing) Duras... is dead. His claim to the leadership died with him. Gowron will lead the Council.
 WORF / Your forces are weak, Gowron... you will need help to fight the family of Duras.
 WORF / I offer you four Klingon squadrons.
 WORF / They are pledged to support... my brother, Kurn.
 WORF / His true bloodline was kept hidden to protect him.
 WORF / I am the elder brother... he will do as I say.
 WORF / You know my price.
 WORF / They will not intervene.
 WORF / I can ask nothing more of him in this matter.
 WORF / My duty as a Starfleet officer---
 PICARD / Report.
 RIKER / We're still trying to sort it out. A Klingon Bird of Prey just decloaked and fired on the Bortas. Neither ship is answering our hail.
 PICARD / Worf is still aboard the Bortas.
 DATA / A second Bird of Prey is decloaking bearing two-four-seven mark three-one-nine.
 PICARD / Go to Red Alert.
 DATA / The second ship is joining the attack on the Bortas.
 PICARD / It's begun.
 WORF / Override engaged! Disruptors still not responding!
 DATA / (reading console) The Bortas is sustaining heavy damage, Captain. Her aft shields have collapsed... life support fluctuating...
 PICARD / The Bortas should have twice the firepower of a Bird of Prey.
 RIKER / (looking at console) Her weapons systems were hit pretty hard... they haven't brought them back on-line yet.
 DATA / The Bortas has lost its port shields... it is unlikely they will withstand another hit on that quarter.
 RIKER / (reading console) The Bortas has sent out a general distress signal.
 PICARD / Ensign Reel... plot a course safely away from the combat area. Half impulse.
 RIKER / Captain... the Bortas is Gowron's ship. If he's the legitimate leader of the Empire, shouldn't we help him?
 PICARD / If we come to his aid... we'll be dragging the Federation into a Klingon civil war.
 RIKER / (quietly) What about Worf?
 PICARD / (to Reel) Ensign... engage.
 WORF / Disruptors on-line!
 WORF / No!
 WORF / (continuing) Their sensors will detect the weapons lock. If they think we're helpless, they'll try to board the ship. (MORE)
 WORF (cont'd) / I can aim and fire disruptors manually when they drop their shields.
 WORF / Thirty-five thousand kellicams. (beat) Twenty thousand kellicams... now within transporter range.
 WORF / They're dropping shields!
 WORF / (working console) Engaging computer control... firing on second target!
 WORF / Disruptors off-line!
 WORF / Incoming message.
 WORF / The enemy has sustained major damage to its life support systems... They have disengaged.
 RIKER / These... enemies are Klingons.
 PICARD / I understand your position. However, you must be aware that the Federation will not become involved in what is, by definition, an internal Klingon matter.
 PICARD / And my duties in that regard are finished.
 WORF / Captain... we must intervene.
 WORF / (continuing) The Duras family is corrupt and hungry for power... with no sense of honor or loyalty. They represent a grave threat to the security of the Federation. (beat, then quieter, a direct appeal) Captain, you and I know that they have conspired with Romulans in the past. If they should be the victors in this war, they will surely form a new Klingon_Romulan alliance. That would represent a fundamental shift of power in this quadrant. (beat) Starfleet must support Gowron... it is in the interests of both the Federation and the Empire. I beg you to support us in our cause.
 PICARD / (slow and firm) Mister Worf... non-interference in the internal affairs of other cultures is one of the guiding principles of the Federation... and as Starfleet officers, we have all sworn an oath to uphold that principle regardless of personal feeling. (to Gowron) I am sorry... but I must refuse your request.
 PICARD / Lieutenant...
 PICARD / (continuing) I'm afraid that I must now recall you to duty. The Enterprise will be leaving this sector immediately.
 WORF / Captain... I respectfully request that I be allowed to take an extended leave of absence.
 PICARD / Lieutenant, your responsibilities as a Starfleet officer are incompatible with remaining aboard a Klingon ship during a time of war.
 WORF / Captain...
 PICARD / You are ordered to return to duty immediately.
 WORF / Then... I must resign my commission as a Starfleet officer.
 WORF / Enter.
 PICARD / Am I intruding?
 WORF / No, sir.
 PICARD / I understand... that you'll be serving aboard the Bortas.
 WORF / As weapons officer.
 PICARD / Your tactical knowledge and experience should serve them well.
 WORF / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / Are you certain you've made the right decision, Worf?
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / (continuing) I was rescued from Khitomer by humans... raised and... loved by human parents. I have lived among humans for most of my life... fought at their sides. (beat) But I was born Klingon. My heart is of that world. I do hear the cry of the warrior... (note of finality) I belong with my people.
 PICARD / Being the only Klingon ever to serve in Starfleet... gave you a singular distinction. (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / But I always felt that the most unique thing about you was your... humanity. (beat) Compassion... generosity... fairness... You took some of the best qualities of humanity and made them part of you. The result... was a man I was proud to call one of my officers.
 PICARD / (re: things on bed) I'll have your belongings transported to the Bortas.
 WORF / Thank you...
 PICARD / Attention on deck!
 Worf and Picard ENTER through the open doors. At the end of the line are (in ascending order of rank) GEORDI, Data, TROI, BEVERLY, and Riker. Worf doesn't / know what to say to these people... how to respond. They stand there silently... their respect and affection for their friend is clear... no words are necessary. Picard goes to the head of the line... Worf steps on the stage.
 WORF / Permission to leave the ship, sir?
 PICARD / Permission granted. (beat) Qapla'
 WORF / Good-bye.
 RIKER / Dismissed.
 WOMAN / Celebrate later, Toral. (beat) We should not discount Jean-Luc Picard yet. He is human...
 WOMAN / (continuing, with ironic smile) ... and humans have a way of showing up when you least expect them.
 WORF / Aft shields buckling!
 WORF / Aft shields are gone!
 WORF / (quietly) We cannot win. We must withdraw.
 WORF / We are entering the star's corona... we will reach the photosphere in thirty seconds.
 WORF / Shields failing... outer hull temperature exceeding design limits...
 WORF / (continuing) Captain!
 WORF / They're closing on us!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45020.4. We have arrived at Starbase Two-thirty-four, where I have taken the opportunity to make a proposal to Fleet Admiral Shanthi.
 PICARD and RIKER are seated across the table from FLEET / ADMIRAL SHANTHI and a N.D. STARFLEET ADMIRAL. Shanthi is the head of Starfleet, and is a woman of African descent in her late fifties with an almost regal bearing. She is listening to Picard while the N.D. Admiral looks on with disapproval.
 PICARD / There have been three major engagements in the last two weeks... all of them won by ships loyal to the Duras family.
 PICARD / Agreed. But if the Duras are being aided by the Romulans, then it becomes very much our concern.
 PICARD / (continuing) The Romulans have been trying to destroy the Federation_Klingon Alliance for over twenty years, and at the same time, the Duras have been secretly conspiring with the Romulans. (beat) Doesn't it strike you as odd that the Duras are able to field such an overpowering force against Gowron? That they outmatch him at almost every turn?
 PICARD / And some would say they must be getting help. (beat) The Romulans have always been willing to take enormous risks in order to gain any advantage over the Federation. (with force) Can we seriously believe that now, with the future of the entire Klingon Empire hanging in the balance, they are content to simply stand by and watch?
 PICARD / We must stop the flow of supplies and equipment from the Romulans to the Duras family. (beat) I propose we take a fleet of ships to the Romulan_Klingon border. We'll take no offensive action, but we'll be in a position to expose any Romulan shipments that try to cross the border.
 PICARD / My chief engineer has developed a system that should help us nullify that advantage. Each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to the other ships in the blockade fleet. In theory, any cloaked vessel that tries to pass between our ships should cross one of those beams and be detected.
 RIKER / (quietly) Nicely done... I hope you know what you're doing.
 PICARD / (quietly) So do I, Number One.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45021.3. Convincing Starfleet Command to establish a blockade was relatively painless. Implementing that plan is proving more troublesome.
 RIKER / Starfleet is stretched pretty thin across the quadrant. There are only twelve ships within one day's travel of this position.
 GEORDI / The only other ships available are either in spacedock for repairs or still under construction. Most of them don't even have full crews yet.
 RIKER / But we could probably pick up seven... maybe eight more ships.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, will we be able to implement your tachyon detection grid with twenty ships?
 GEORDI / (dubious) It's possible... (beat) But the more ships, the bigger the net we can throw.
 PICARD / (decisive) I want to add the Tian Nan Men, the Hermes, and the Sutherland to join us whether the yard superintendent thinks they're ready or not. Mister Data, select a group of experienced officers from the Enterprise to augment the crews of those ships.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Will, I want you to command the Excalibur. Her crew was reassigned when she put in for repairs. Geordi, you'll serve as his first officer.
 PICARD / (continuing, to everyone) I want the fleet to be underway by oh nine hundred tomorrow. Thank you, gentlemen.
 PICARD / Yes, Data?
 DATA / May I ask a question of a... personal nature, sir?
 PICARD / Yes.
 DATA / Why have I not been assigned to command a ship in the fleet?
 PICARD / Well... I felt that you were needed here. (beat, then curious) Why do you ask?
 DATA / You have commented on the lack of senior officers available for this mission. I believe that my twenty-six years of Starfleet service qualify me for such a post. (beat) However, if you do not believe the time has arrived for an android to command a starship, then perhaps I should address myself to improving---
 PICARD / Commander... I believe the starship Sutherland will need a captain. I can think of no one more suited to the task than you.
 DATA / Thank you, Captain.
 WORF / (disapproving) You drink with our enemy...
 WORF / (reading PADD) The repairs on the Hegh'ta are proceeding. The port stabilizers are---
 WORF / It is my responsibility to oversee the repairs aboard ship.
 DATA / I am Lieutenant Commander Data.
 DATA / By order of Starfleet, I hereby take command of this vessel. Please note the time and date in the ship's log.
 DATA / (to com) Computer, what is the status of the dilithium matrix?
 DATA / May I ask why?
 DATA / Your service record to date suggests that you would perform that function competently.
 DATA / Why?
 DATA / I understand your concerns. (beat) Request denied.
 PICARD / Good. (to conn ) Course one one eight mark three five seven, full impulse power (to O'Brien) Signal the fleet to get underway. We'll enter warp once we're clear of the system.
 PICARD / Engage.
 WORF / There is no time for this! We must make plans before those forces reach Beta Lankal!
 WORF / (continuing) How can we oppose the Duras when we continue to fight among ourselves?
 WORF / (to Kulge) Stop this! (to everyone) Are we to fall upon each other like a pack of Ferengi? The enemy is the Duras! We are at war!
 PICARD / Signal the fleet to maintain yellow alert until further notice.
 PICARD / (moves to tactical) Begin long-range scans of the Romulan border.
 PICARD / (looking at console) Those anomalies could be cloaked ships.
 PICARD / Open a channel to the Excalibur.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Excalibur, Riker here.
 PICARD / Deploy the fleet, Will. It's time to spread our net.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir.
 DATA / All stop. Notify the flagship that we have assumed station.
 DATA / Why are auxiliary back-ups not functioning?
 DATA / You have taken the phaser and torpedo control units off-line.
 DATA / Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate for you to determine a course of action without consulting the commanding officer.
 DATA / Take the phasers and torpedo units off-line and begin repairs on the starboard power coupling.
 RIKER / We're ready, sir.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, how long do you think it will take the Romulans to detect the tachyon field once it's activated?
 GEORDI / (thinks) Not long... Romulan sensors are as good as ours.
 PICARD / Very well. Energize the network.
 RIKER / Captain, the tachyon network is active.
 PICARD / Acknowledged.
 PICARD / (nods) They've probably been sitting there watching us for some time now.
 PICARD / Not yet.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Tasha?
 PICARD / Then you believe her, Counselor?
 TROI / I'm not saying we should accept her claim at face value... but I sensed no deception from her. She really believes that she is the daughter of Tasha Yar.
 BEVERLY / Regardless of what she believes, Sela cannot be her daughter. I've reviewed all of Tasha's medical records, and there is no indication that she was ever pregnant.
 PICARD / Besides, Tasha would have been a child when this woman was born.
 TROI / Sela could have been cloned.
 BEVERLY / Or had her appearance surgically altered...
 PICARD / But why? What possible advantage do the Romulans think they would gain?
 PICARD / (continuing) As it now stands, I don't see how this has any impact on our present strategy. We'll continue the blockade and leave the next move to them.
 PICARD / Not at all. Is something wrong?
 PICARD / I think the Romulans have created what they hope will be a distraction... something to keep us off balance.
 PICARD / The Enterprise C? It was lost... at the battle of Narendra Three... while defending a Klingon outpost from the Romulans.
 PICARD / There were stories... that there might have been prisoners, taken back to Romulus. But those were just rumors.
 PICARD / Guinan... that was twenty-three years ago... Tasha was still a child...
 PICARD / How could you know these things?
 PICARD / Tasha died... a year before you came to the Enterprise. You never met her.
 PICARD / If you have nothing more than a vague intuition...
 PICARD / I think... it's time I met Commander Sela.
 WORF / We are at war! Gowron should forbid any challenges until we are victorious.
 WORF / A Klingon should place the good of the Empire above his own pride!
 WORF / (irritated) No.
 PICARD / I'm afraid you misinterpret our presence here. I want to reassure you that we have no hostile intentions.
 PICARD / It is most certainly our intent to prevent any external power from interfering in Klingon affairs.
 PICARD / Then why not send your ships across?
 PICARD / All right. Why did I invite you?
 PICARD / It's been suggested that Tasha was aboard the Enterprise-C when it was destroyed twenty-four years ago. She was one of the survivors. You are obviously the product of a union between her and a Romulan.
 PICARD / And yet you claim that it is possible -- that Tasha Yar was your mother.
 PICARD / I want to meet her.
 PICARD / Your mother. Is she still alive?
 PICARD / Doubts? I'm full of them. Nothing in my experience can assure me that what you say is true... but I do know one thing: it will not affect my judgment in our next encounter.
 WORF / (to Lursa) What do you want?
 WORF / (with contempt) Your family has never valued honor.
 WORF / Then you should not have opposed Gowron.
 WORF / My help?
 WORF / (with anger) An era where honor has no meaning... where Klingons trade loyalties in dark rooms... and where the Empire is ruled... from Romulus.
 PICARD / In thirteen hours we will be forced to either withdraw from the border or fight the Romulan fleet. Neither of those alternatives is acceptable. We must expose their involvement before the deadline.
 PICARD / If you launch a massive attack now, the Duras forces will need supplies... Lursa and B'Etor will call for help... the Romulans will try to run the blockade... and we'll be ready for them.
 PICARD / When Gowron begins his attack, we'll make our move. (points to display) The Excalibur will fall back with "engine problems." You will take the Hornet and the Akagi to this position... which will open a small gap in our detection net.
 RIKER / (nods) And if the Romulans already know about the tachyon field, they should try to run the blockade at that point.
 PICARD / Exactly. (indicating display) But when they try to send their ships through, the Enterprise and the Tian Nan Men will swing around, close the gap and catch them in the act.
 RIKER / (impressed) Very nice. (beat) I'd better get back.
 PICARD / Good luck, Will.
 RIKER / Good luck, Captain.
 PICARD / Signal the fleet to stand by.
 PICARD / Open a channel to the Sutherland.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data here, sir.
 PICARD / We're reading a disruption of the tachyon net in your area.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir. The Romulans have released a high-energy burst. The net is no longer effective in a radius of ten million kilometers around the Sutherland.
 PICARD / That's where they're going through. (beat) Send a signal to the fleet... all ships to fall back and rendezvous at Gamma Eridon. We'll try to reestablish the net before they get there.
 DATA / Acknowledge the signal. (to Conn Officer) Lay in the course and engage at warp nine point three.
 DATA / In disrupting the detection net, the Romulans may have caused a residual tachyon signature to form around their own ships.
 DATA / (to Conn Officer) All stop.
 DATA / The tachyon signatures will not last long. By the time the fleet is redeployed, it will be too late. Begin to reconfigure sensors to detect ionized particle traces.
 DATA / I am aware of the difficulties. (beat) Please bring the phasers back on-line.
 DATA / We will initiate radiation protocol when necessary.
 DATA / (interrupting) Mister Hobson! (evenly) You will carry out my orders or I will relieve you of duty.
 PICARD / Hail the Sutherland.
 DATA / Display sensor schematic.
 DATA / Begin sensor sweep, maximum range.
 DATA / Computer, overlay display with tachyon emissions.
 DATA / (continuing) Highlight any tachyon signatures which show subspace inertial displacement.
 DATA / Concentrate a sensor sweep in that area.
 DATA / Reconfigure the photon torpedo warhead yields. Set for a high- energy burst at level six.
 DATA / Do it.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Mister Data, you were ordered to rendezvous with the fleet at Gamma Eridon. Acknowledge.
 DATA / Stand by, Captain. (steady, to Hobson) Mister Hobson, prepare to fire.
 DATA / Fire.
 DATA / The reconfigured particles from the photon torpedoes illuminated the tachyon signatures surrounding the Romulan ships...
 DATA / Make a full report to the flagship. Take the main phasers off-line and begin radiation clean-up on the affected decks.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's personal log, supplemental. It is with a profound sense of relief that I have ordered the fleet back to Federation territory following the news of Gowron's victory.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) We have arrived at the Klingon Home World, where I will present the High Council with a full report on our encounter with the Romulans. (MORE)
 PICARD (V.O.) (cont'd) / (beat) I am also... anxious to learn of Worf's fate.
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / Sir, I wish to submit myself for disciplinary action (off Picard's look) I disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer. Although there was a positive outcome as a result of my actions, I have learned that... the ends cannot justify the means.
 PICARD / No, they can't. (thoughtful beat) However... the excuse "I was only following orders" is the epitaph of too many tragedies in our history. Starfleet does not want officers who will blindly follow orders without analyzing the situation. (beat) Your actions were appropriate for the circumstance, and I have noted that in your record.
 PICARD / Mister Data...
 PICARD / (less formal) Nicely done.
 DATA / Thank you, sir.
 WORF / No.
 WORF / (with glance at Picard) I know... but it is not my way. (beat, to Gowron) This boy has done me no harm... and I will not kill him for the crimes of his family.
 WORF / No. You gave his life to me... and I have spared it.
 WORF / Permission to return to duty, sir?
 PICARD / Granted.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45047.2. The Enterprise is en route to an uninhabited planet in the El-Adrel system. The location is mid-way between Federation space and the territory occupied by an enigmatic race known as "The Children of Tama."
 PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA and WORF. The Enterprise is / at warp. A schematic of a Tamarian spacecraft is displayed at Data's end of the table.
 PICARD / The Tamarians apparently arrived at El-Adrel Four nearly three weeks ago. They've been transmitting a subspace signal toward Federation space ever since.
 DATA / The signal is a standard mathematical progression. It does not carry a specific message.
 RIKER / But they want us to know they're there.
 PICARD / Apparently so. Starfleet believes their presence is an attempt to start a dialogue. (to Data) Commander.
 DATA / Federation vessels have encountered Tamarian ships seven times over the past one hundred years. Each meeting was without incident, but formal relations were never established because communication was not possible.
 RIKER / Why?
 DATA / The Children of Tama were called "incomprehensible" by Captain Silvestri of the Shiku Maru. Other accounts are comparable.
 WORF / A cause for concern. For all we know, they are threatening our border.
 TROI / Everything in the previous encounters suggests a peaceable race. We have to start from there.
 PICARD / Agreed. I appreciate your prudence, Lieutenant Worf. But given the evidence, Starfleet has arrived at a reasonable conclusion. The Tamarians have extended a hand -- we must do the same.
 RIKER / The "Children of Tama." I've heard rumors about them for years.
 PICARD / As have I, Number One.
 PICARD / (continuing) Are they truly "incomprehensible"? In my experience, communication is a function of patience and imagination. I'd like to think we have both qualities in sufficient measure.
 PICARD / Counselor...
 TROI / I'm picking up nothing but good intentions, Captain.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / The Tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individuals and locations.
 PICARD / But what does it all mean?
 DATA / I am at a loss, sir.
 PICARD / (to screen) Captain, I invite you to consider the creation of a mutual non-aggression pact between our two peoples. Possibly leading to a trade agreement and cultural interchange. Does this sound like a reasonable course of action?
 PICARD / Impressions, Number One.
 RIKER / They seem to be trying their best.
 PICARD / As are we. For what it's worth.
 WORF / (indicating screen) Captain.
 RIKER / Block their transporter with the shields! Extend to maximum range!
 WORF / Not enough time!
 RIKER / (to Data) Where is he?
 DATA / (off instruments) The Tamarians have transported Captain Picard to the surface. With their own captain...
 RIKER / (touches insignia) Riker to O'Brien --
 DATA / -- Transport will not be possible, Commander. The Tamarian ship has created a particle scattering field in the planet's ionosphere.
 RIKER / Riker to Captain Picard... (no response) Captain, do you read me?
 RIKER / (continuing) Can we compensate?
 DATA / (off instruments) No, sir. The Tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beam into the upper atmosphere. The result is a hyperionization that disrupts virtually all EM and subspace carriers.
 RIKER / That means they can't communicate with their man, either. Or beam anybody through the field.
 DATA / That is correct. However, they have left sensor frequencies clear.
 RIKER / So they can read what's going on? Analysis, Mister Worf. What the hell is going on?
 WORF / (shrugs) A contest, perhaps. (in explanation) Between champions. Our captain against theirs.
 RIKER / (remembering) Theirs was armed...
 PICARD / (re: the weapon) You expect me to fight -- is that it? A challenge?
 PICARD / I don't know who or what Darmok and Jalad are. But I didn't come here to start a war.
 PICARD / I refuse.
 PICARD / (continuing) Would you attack an unarmed man, Captain? There's not much of a challenge in that.
 PICARD / (shakes head) I'm sorry, Captain.
 DATA / Sensors show the captain and the Tamarian in apparent good health, approximately twenty meters from each other.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Lieutenant, hail the Tamarian ship.
 WORF / On screen.
 RIKER / (to screen) You are holding our captain. I want him released.
 RIKER / Your actions can be interpreted as an act of war.
 RIKER / (to Data) Is there any way to get through to them?
 DATA / Not without further study.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, close the channel.
 WORF / Gladly, sir.
 RIKER / (to Worf) I want you and a security team to take a shuttle down to the planet. Bring back the captain.
 WORF / Aye, Commander.
 DATA / Sir, the Tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle.
 RIKER / I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam is one thing. Firing on a shuttle is something else entirely. I'm betting they're not gonna push it that far.
 PICARD / "Shaka" indeed.
 PICARD / (continuing) What now, Captain? Will you attack me in my sleep?
 PICARD / (exaggerating) If I don't freeze to death first...
 PICARD / Picard of the Federation.
 PICARD / (continuing) Of the starship Enterprise... Of the planet Earth...
 PICARD / (continuing) Temba? What do you mean? Fire? Temba means fire?
 PICARD / Temba is a person? His arms are wide. Because he's holding them apart? In generosity? In giving? In taking?
 PICARD / Thank you. (indicates branch) Thank you.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, supplemental. I am sending a shuttlecraft to find Captain Picard, gambling that the Tamarians will back down rather than risk an exchange of phaser fire. But I feel like I'm playing a deadly game -- the captain's life is the prize, and I still don't know the rules.
 WORF / (off instruments) The positron density is point zero one three. Electron concentration is seven point nine-five.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / (heavily fritzed) We are two hundred fifty kilometers from the planet's surface.
 DATA / The shuttle has reached the E region of the planet's ionosphere.
 RIKER / How long can we maintain communications?
 DATA / The scattering layer induced by the Tamarians is concentrated in the upper D region. The shuttle will enter that area in approximately two minutes.
 RIKER / The Tamarian ship?
 DATA / Unchanged, sir. They appear to be making no attempt to stop us.
 RIKER / Maybe we called their bluff.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (extremely fritzed) Status, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Navigational, life-support, propulsion normal. Onboard systems do not appear to be disrupted by the field. But I can barely read you, Commander.
 RIKER / (to com) Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Maintain contact as long as conditions permit --
 DATA / (off instruments) -- Commander! I am reading a power surge in the Tamarian plasma reactor.
 RIKER / (to com) Mister Worf! Evasive maneuver sequence delta!
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (totally fritzed) -- Maneuver sequence delta! Maneuver sequence --
 DATA / (off instruments) Commander, the shuttle has been hit.
 RIKER / Damage.
 DATA / The starboard nacelle has been rendered inoperable.
 RIKER / (surprised) That's all? (to com) Riker to Lieutenant Worf.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (fritzed) Report.
 WORF / (to com) Starboard thrusters destroyed. Commander, I may be able to land. I will not be able to take off.
 RIKER / (to com) Understood, Lieutenant. Return to the Enterprise.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Enough to make them turn back, but not enough to hurt them.
 DATA / Yes, sir. The phaser pulse appears to have been carefully attenuated for just that effect.
 RIKER / (begrudgingly) Nice shooting...
 GEORDI / I'm pretty sure I can punch up the annular confinement beam -- enough to transport the captain through the field. But it's gonna take a full day at least.
 TROI / Captain Picard could be dead by then.
 WORF / I do not believe so.
 WORF / (continuing) I have confidence in his ability as a warrior. He will be victorious.
 TROI / You're still assuming this is some sort of a challenge ritual. We can't be certain of that.
 RIKER / Agreed. We're making educated guesses about their motivations -- no more than that.
 WORF / Then why do we wait? If we attack the ship directly, they will be unable to maintain the scattering field.
 RIKER / Which could start a shooting match, and for all we know, a war. And we still might not be able to save the captain.
 WORF / It will end this stalemate.
 RIKER / There's too much at risk. I'll take that course when it's the only one left.
 RIKER / (continuing) Who the hell are these people? There's got to be some way to get through to them.
 DATA / As I have said, with further study it may be possible to --
 RIKER / -- Then do it. (to Troi) Deanna, help him. I want something by oh-nine hundred hours.
 PICARD / (to himself) Where have you gone to, my friend?
 PICARD / (to himself) Forgive the intrusion, Captain. But I need some answers.
 DATA / Freeze.
 TROI / "Darmok." It seems to be a point of contention between them. Perhaps something the Tamarian captain proposed but his First Officer didn't like?
 DATA / The apparent emotional dynamic does seem to support that assumption. As with the other terms used by the Tamarian, it appears to be a proper noun. The name clearly carries a meaning for them.
 TROI / Computer, search for the term "Darmok" in all linguistic databases compiled for this sector.
 TROI / -- Stop search. Computer, how many entries for "Darmok"?
 TROI / (continuing) All our technology and experience: our universal translator, our years in space -- contacts with more alien cultures than I can remember...
 DATA / I have encountered one-thousand, seven-hundred, fifty-four non-Human races during my tenure with Starfleet.
 TROI / (smiling) ... and we still can't even say "hello" to these people.
 DATA / That is correct.
 TROI / A single word can lead to tragedy. A word misspoken, misunderstood. (re: Tamarians on screen) That could happen here, Data. If you and I fail...
 DATA / Replay at time index one-four-four.
 DATA / Freeze.
 DATA / Computer, search for the term "Tanagra." All databases.
 DATA / (immediately) -- Stop.
 TROI / (excited) Shantil Three? Computer, cross- reference the last entry with the previous search index.
 TROI / I think we've got something.
 PICARD / (to himself) A captain's log... ?
 PICARD / (indicating campsite) I was curious. I meant no harm.
 PICARD / --Enough! I'm not going to fight you. You'll just have to---
 WORF / Commander! Sensors are picking up an electromagnetic disturbance -- approaching the captain's position.
 RIKER / Analysis?
 WORF / (off instruments) A variable induction field... possibly a life-form.
 RIKER / How close is it to the captain?
 WORF / The field is erratic -- appearing and disappearing -- but it seems to be moving toward him.
 RIKER / Attacking?
 PICARD / I'll go along with that.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to La Forge.
 GEORDI / (touches combadge) La Forge here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / How close are we on the transporter?
 GEORDI / About two hours -- maybe three.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I want the captain out of there now.
 GEORDI / That's not... likely, sir.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I don't want to hear that, Commander.
 GEORDI / (to Lefler) What's the resonance frequency?
 GEORDI / I want a resolution of point five three at the very least. (to com) I'll need two more minutes, Commander. But there's a good chance this isn't gonna work.
 WORF / If it fails...
 RIKER / I know. We'll have tipped our hand to the Tamarians. But that's a chance we've got to take.
 WORF / Agreed.
 RIKER / (to com) La Forge. Proceed.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We're on it. La Forge out.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to transporter room one.
 RIKER / (to com) Stand by, Mister O'Brien...
 PICARD / Come on.
 PICARD / Shaka... You said that before. When I couldn't build a fire. A failure? An inability to do something?
 PICARD / -- at Tanagra.
 PICARD / (continuing) I remember the words. But I don't understand...
 GEORDI / Matrix levels.
 GEORDI / That isn't gonna do it. Increase thermal input coefficient to one hundred fifty-percent.
 RIKER / (to com) Status, La Forge.
 GEORDI / (to com) We're almost there, Commander. (to Lefler) Shunt the overload to the phase transition sequencers in transporter one.
 GEORDI / (to com) La Forge to O'Brien.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Confirm phase sequencer linkage.
 PICARD / At Lashmir. Was it like this at Lashmir? Similar to what we're facing now?
 PICARD / (excited) A strategy? With fist open...
 PICARD / (continuing) With fist open. Why... ? To lure the enemy...
 PICARD / (closing his fist) With fist closed. An army. Open... to lure the enemy. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Then closed... To attack. That's how you communicate, isn't it? By citing example. By metaphor. (indicating creature) Uzani's army. With fist closed!
 PICARD / No --
 RIKER / (to com) La Forge, boost the confinement beam!
 GEORDI / (to com) It's as solid as it'll go, Commander.
 WORF / The Tamarian and the entity are in close proximity. The Tamarian's lifesigns are fluctuating.
 RIKER / (off instruments) The scattering field is still in full force. (indicates screen) What the hell is wrong with them?
 RIKER / (continuing) Their sensors can read what's going on as well as ours can. (to com) Riker to O'Brien. Report.
 RIKER / Open a channel to the Tamarian ship.
 WORF / (touches controls) Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (to screen) Your captain is under attack. Drop your particle field.
 WORF / They have closed the channel.
 PICARD / (nodding) ... when the walls fell.
 RIKER (O.S.) / First Officer's log, stardate 45047.8. Our attempt to transport Captain Picard back to the ship has failed. My options are narrowing. And my patience is all but gone.
 RIKER / Here's the situation on El-Adrel. The entity has moved off several hundred meters.
 BEVERLY / Captain Picard's bioscan readings are stable. The Tamarian's are not.
 TROI / He may have been injured...
 RIKER / If the entity attacks again, the captain could be facing it alone.
 GEORDI / The transporter's completely out of the question. The Tamarian ship has deepened the scattering field to the D region of the ionosphere. There's no getting through.
 WORF / Unless we attack the ship itself.
 RIKER / Can you pinpoint the source of their particle beam?
 GEORDI / They're using a polarity coil generator located aft of their warp drive. It's heavily shielded.
 RIKER / Can we get through with our phasers?
 GEORDI / Not with the first spread. It'll take a few hits.
 RIKER / That's not good enough. I want to be able to knock out the scattering field in one shot and have the captain back on the Enterprise before they know what happened.
 GEORDI / If we selectively target the amplification pathways around the generator, it should be just as effective. And we can do it in one burst.
 RIKER / How long to set that up?
 GEORDI / Worf and I will have to adjust the prefire chambers. That'll give us the focus we need. (shrugs) A few hours.
 RIKER / Get started.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (re: Worf and Geordi) I'd prefer to find a peaceful solution. If we can talk our way out of this -- so much the better.
 TROI / Unfortunately, it's not that simple.
 RIKER / What have you found?
 DATA / The Tamarian ego structure does not seem to allow what we normally think of as self-identity. Their ability to abstract is highly unusual. They seem to communicate through narrative imagery -- by reference to the individuals and places which appear in their mytho-historical accounts.
 TROI / It's as if I were to say to you "Juliet. On her balcony."
 BEVERLY / An image of romance.
 TROI / Exactly. Image is everything to the Tamarians. (MORE)
 TROI (cont'd) / It embodies their emotional states, their very thought processes. It's how they communicate, and how they think.
 RIKER / If we know how they think, can't we get something across to them?
 DATA / No sir. The situation is analogous to understanding the grammar of a language but none of the vocabulary.
 BEVERLY / (nodding) If I didn't know who Juliet was or what she was doing on that balcony, the image alone wouldn't mean anything.
 TROI / That's correct. We know, for instance, that "Darmok" was a great hero -- a hunter. Tanagra was an island. But that's all. Without the details, there's no understanding.
 DATA / It is necessary for us to learn the narratives from which the Tamarians are drawing these images. (beat) Given our current relations, that does not appear likely.
 PICARD / Our situation is similar to theirs. I understand. But I need to know more. Tell me more. About Darmok and Jalad. Tell me...
 PICARD / (continuing) You used the words "Temba. His arms wide" when you gave me the fire. And the dagger. Could that mean give? (pointing to Dathon) Temba. His arms wide. Darmok. Give me more about Darmok.
 PICARD / (indicating stone) Darmok.
 PICARD / (indicating circle) The ocean.
 PICARD / (continuing) "Darmok on the ocean."
 PICARD / (continuing) A metaphor. For being alone? Isolated? "Darmok on the ocean."
 PICARD / (standing) Are you alright?
 PICARD / (indicating Dathon) Temba. His arms wide. Give me more. "Darmok on the ocean... "
 PICARD / "At Tanagra." A country? "Tanagra on the ocean." An island. (a "more" motion) Temba... His arms wide.
 PICARD / "Jalad at Tanagra." He went to the same island as Darmok. To Tanagra.
 PICARD / The beast. A creature on the island? On Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad -- did they fight the beast?
 PICARD / (continuing) They arrived separately. They struggled against a common foe. (beat) "The beast at Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad."
 PICARD / (realizing) They left together.
 PICARD / (continuing) Darmok and Jalad on the ocean.
 PICARD / You hoped this would happen, didn't you? You knew there was a dangerous creature on this planet. And you knew from the tale of Darmok that danger shared can sometimes bring two people together. (indicating situation) Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. You and me, here -- at El-Adrel.
 PICARD / (realizing) My turn? I'm afraid I'm not much of a story teller. And you wouldn't understand me anyway. (shakes head) Shaka... when the walls fell.
 PICARD / (continuing) Perhaps that doesn't matter. You want to hear it anyway...
 PICARD / (continuing) There is a story... A very ancient one. From Earth. I'll try to remember...
 PICARD / Gilgamesh. Was a king. At Uruk. He tormented his subjects. He drove them to anger. They cried out -- "Give our king a companion. Spare us his madness."
 PICARD / (continuing) Enkidu. A wildman. Of the forest. Entered the city. They fought in the temple. They fought in the street. Gilgamesh defeated Enkidu. They became friends. (beat) Gilgamesh and Enkidu. At Uruk.
 PICARD / (quiet) The new friends went into the desert, where the Great Bull of Heaven was killing men by the hundreds. Enkidu caught it by the tail, Gilgamesh struck it with his sword.
 PICARD / They were victorious. But Enkidu fell to the ground. Struck down by the gods...
 PICARD / (continuing; a whisper) And Gilgamesh wept bitter tears, saying, "He who was my companion through adventure and hardships, is gone forever... "
 RIKER / First Officer's log, supplemental. I have no choice but to break the stalemate. If war is the result... Maybe it was inevitable. Perhaps the distance between our races is so vast that nothing else was ever possible...
 WORF / Phasers are nearly ready, sir.
 RIKER / Stand by to fire, Mister Worf.
 DATA / (off instruments) Commander. The Tamarian's bioscans have become unreadable. (beat) He may be dead, sir.
 RIKER / If we know it -- so do the Tamarians. (to CON) Riker to La Forge.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here.
 RIKER / (to com) I need those phasers --
 DATA / (interrupting) Sir -- sensors are tracking the entity. It is approaching Captain Picard's position.
 PICARD / I understand your sacrifice, Captain.
 PICARD / (re: the roar) Unfortunately, if our friend out there has its way, no one will ever know what you tried to do...
 DATA / (off instruments) Nine meters and closing... Commander...
 DATA / (continuing) Six meters...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to bridge. You have phasers!
 RIKER / Fire!
 WORF / (off instruments) Their particle beam emitters are inoperative.
 DATA / The scattering field is down.
 RIKER / (to com) O'Brien! Energize!
 RIKER / (to Worf) Maximum shields.
 WORF / (touches controls) Aye.
 RIKER / Red Alert.
 WORF / Starboard shields holding at fifty-two percent. Forward shields gone.
 RIKER / Let's get out of here.
 DATA / That will not be possible, Commander. The starboard nacelle sustained a direct hit. Warp engines are off-line.
 RIKER / Go to impulse. Back us off.
 WORF / (off instruments) They are matching our maneuver. And firing...
 RIKER / (no choice) Return fire, Mister Worf. Full phasers.
 WORF / Firing, sir.
 WORF / Their shields are holding. They are firing again.
 WORF / (continuing) Our shields have failed!
 DATA / Commander -- we cannot survive another hit.
 PICARD / (as he moves) Hail the Tamarian ship.
 WORF / (touches controls) Aye, Captain.
 PICARD / --Temarc!
 PICARD / (continuing) The river Temarc. In winter.
 PICARD / ... And Jalad. At Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean.
 PICARD / (continuing) The beast at Tanagra. Uzani. His army. (shaking his head) Shaka. When the walls fell.
 PICARD / Temba. His arms open.
 PICARD / (almost to himself) Thank you...
 RIKER / (re: Tamarians) New friends, Captain?
 PICARD / I can't say, Number One.
 PICARD / (continuing) But at least they're not new enemies.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / I hope I'm not intruding, Captain.
 PICARD / Not at all, Number One. Please.
 RIKER / Damage reports are ready for your review.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 RIKER / Greek, sir?
 PICARD / The Homeric Hymns. (glances up) One of the root metaphors of our own culture.
 RIKER / For the next time we encounter the Tamarians...
 PICARD / (nodding) More familiarity with our own mythology might help us relate to theirs.
 PICARD / The Tamarian was willing to risk all of us -- just for the hope of communication, of connection. And now the door's open between our peoples. That commitment meant more to him than his own life.
 PICARD / (continuing) Would I do the same... ?
 PICARD / (trying to be polite) Yes, well, one does not always have the luxury...
 PICARD / (sighs) Whenever possible.
 PICARD / (interrupting) Well, it looks very nice, Mot... that should suffice...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / (hits insignia, with an edge) Yes?
 RIKER / Sorry to interrupt. We're receiving an emergency distress signal from the Solarion Four colony.
 PICARD / (to com) Lay in a new course. I'm on my way.
 PICARD / Report.
 RIKER / The signal ended abruptly at oh four five five... unable to raise them on subspace...
 PICARD / Hail them on upper and lower band frequencies, Mister Worf...
 WORF / I've tried, sir. No response.
 PICARD / Time to the Solarion system?
 DATA / Twenty-six minutes, Captain.
 PICARD / I understand you've been discussing alternative adversarial engagement strategies with Mot.
 RIKER / (reacts) It would be more accurate to say he was discussing them with me... (beat) He's the best barber in Starfleet... what can you do... ?
 WORF / Sir, receiving another signal from a vessel leaving orbit of Solarion Four... new frequency, low band... audio only...
 PICARD / Open the channel.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45076.3. We have arrived at Lya Station Alpha with survivors from Solarion Four. Admiral Kennelly has rendezvoused to discuss the Bajoran terrorist attack.
 PICARD / (to com) Ginger tea with honey, very hot.
 PICARD / My Aunt Rebecca's cure for the common cold.
 PICARD / Did the liaison have anything to say about the attack?
 PICARD / But in forty years, the Bajorans have never attacked a Federation target...
 PICARD / And our response?
 PICARD / (acknowledges) On many worlds we've been to, they are isolated, treated as pariahs...
 PICARD / That could be done through diplomatic channels, Admiral... what do you really want from us?
 PICARD / Any way I can...
 PICARD / And what do I have to offer that might persuade him to cooperate?
 PICARD / (not nearly adequate) Admiral...
 PICARD / They have endured generations of sympathy and promises. I cannot believe this Orta will be satisfied with more of the same.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (to com) Go ahead.
 RIKER / Captain, have you approved the transfer of a new officer to the Enterprise?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Negative...
 RIKER / Well, I've got one waiting to transport aboard...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (continuing) ... complete with orders. Ensign Ro Laren.
 PICARD / Ro Laren? From the Wellington?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / The same one, sir. Should I tell her a mistake's been made?
 PICARD / (re: the Admiral) Stand by, Commander.
 PICARD / Admiral... respectfully... (beat, trying to fashion a polite way of saying this) I would appreciate some consulting rights on the assignment of a new officer... especially someone with the record of Ro Laren...
 PICARD / There are other Bajorans in Starfleet... assign one of them...
 PICARD / After what happened at Garon Two, she has no business serving on any starship as far as I'm concerned... let alone the flagship, my ship...
 PICARD / It's that important to you...
 PICARD / Picard to Riker.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 PICARD / Proceed with the transport.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Sir... ?
 PICARD / I'll fill you in later, Commander.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yessir.
 PICARD / Admiral, I hope neither of us regrets this.
 PICARD / (even) Aunt Rebecca would be pleased.
 RIKER / Energize.
 RIKER / You'll follow the Starfleet uniform code aboard this ship, Ensign.
 RIKER / There will be members of the crew who will not want to serve with Ensign Laren, Captain.
 PICARD / They'll have to learn to live with it.
 RIKER / I intend to demand the highest standards of performance from her.
 PICARD / I would expect nothing less.
 PICARD / It won't be for long, Will.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Yes, Ensign Laren, please have a seat...
 PICARD / I beg your pardon?
 PICARD / (glances at Riker) I'm sorry, I didn't...
 PICARD / I wish to be candid with you, Ensign.
 PICARD / I am fully aware of your Starfleet record, your problems on other ships, the incident on Garon Two that led to your court martial. I feel it only fair to inform you that I am personally concerned about your presence on this most critical mission...
 RIKER / Then why did you accept this assignment?
 RIKER / (galled) Better than prison. Ensign, there are officers who wait years to serve aboard this...
 RIKER / ... Nor ours...
 PICARD / Nevertheless... (beat) ... we are going to be serving together and I think it would be wise for Commander Riker and me to clearly voice our expectations and...
 PICARD / Dismissed.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are approaching the Valo system on the outskirts of Cardassian territory, where many Bajorans have resettled.
 DATA / There are dozens of Bajoran camps on the three M-class planets. I suggest we may want to begin on Valo Three, where an ad hoc leader named Jas Holza lives. The Federation has had several dealings with him...
 BEVERLY / I met Holza at a symposium a few years ago...
 PICARD / What can you tell us about him, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (thinking back) I found him to be a very concerned leader and a good spokesman for his people... (beat, remembering) And a terrific dancer...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Really... at the reception afterwards...
 TROI / At least this man has genuine experience in diplomacy...
 PICARD / (acknowledges) That is not a small advantage on this mission... Very well... Mister Data, contact Holza, arrange a meeting... set a course for Valo Three.
 RIKER / Ensign Ro, you're familiar with this star system; take the conn...
 RIKER / Is there some problem, Ensign?
 DATA / Whom do you suggest we talk to, Ensign?
 WORF / This ship is prepared to defend itself if necessary.
 PICARD / (controlled) Well. Let us hope you are mistaken, Ensign. Now... perhaps you could point us in the right direction as Mister Data suggested.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. I read about the achievements of the ancient Bajoran civilization in my fifth grade reader... they were architects and artists and builders and philosophers... when humans were not yet standing erect.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Now I see how history has rewarded them...
 PICARD / Thank you for meeting with us, Mister Keeve.
 PICARD / Ensign Ro has educated me.
 PICARD / Do you know where we can find Orta?
 PICARD / Might you be able to help us locate him?
 PICARD / Then I don't understand why you are unwilling...
 PICARD / We were saddened by those events... but they occurred within the designated borders of the Cardassian Empire...
 PICARD / I'm not here to debate Federation policy. I am prepared to offer assistance...
 PICARD / We have had our own problems with the Cardassians... now that there is a treaty, we are in a position to help. Your people have been forced to resettle all over the quadrant. We can make a legitimate case with the Cardassians that this is no longer an isolated problem. We will work diplomatically on your behalf... but first the terrorist attacks must end.
 PICARD / Mister Data -- see to it that our replicators provide blankets for every man, woman and child here before nightfall.
 DATA / Yessir.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, you will determine if these people have any other emergency needs and provide whatever we can...
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / You were helpful.
 PICARD / In an age when their technology should be able to feed and clothe all of them... that they should have to live like this...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45077.8. Keeve Falor has kept his promise and directed us toward the third moon of Valo One... where we will meet tomorrow with the terrorist leader, Orta.
 TROI / Do you mind if we join you?
 GEORDI / ... I'll tell you one thing... if I find myself on an away team with Ensign Ro... I'll never turn my back on her...
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) This was orders. Had to be. She doesn't belong here. Doesn't belong in the uniform if you ask me.
 GEORDI / Really.
 PICARD / Any indications of weapons or vessels beneath the surface?
 RIKER / (shakes his head) The composition of the moon's crust is blocking the sensors...
 PICARD / ... which is very likely why they chose this moon for their base of operations...
 RIKER / We're on a timetable here. Where's Ro?
 PICARD / (keys insignia) Captain Picard to Ensign Ro.
 DATA / Computer, locate Ensign Ro.
 WORF / (to Collins) Check the transport log.
 PICARD / (frowns) Mister Collins, any activity at the designated site of our meeting...
 RIKER / What the hell is going on...
 PICARD / Prepare to transport us to the same location Ensign Ro beamed to... Mister Worf, phasers...
 DATA / The tricorder is picking up molecular displacement traces... it suggests movement through this area during the last ten hours...
 PICARD / See if we can determine their direction... Standard search pattern...
 WORF / Maintain tricorder security link.
 PICARD AND WORF / 
 TROI / Data, I'm picking up energy fluctuations over here... (keys insignia) Troi to Picard. (a beat, reacts) Captain, acknowledge...
 DATA / Data to Picard... Data to Worf...
 PICARD / Abducting us was not necessary.
 PICARD / Then she has done us both a disservice. For I am committed to peace.
 PICARD / Ensign, whatever your motives, you have already done enough damage to these negotiations. With your permission, Orta, I will have her transported back to my ship.
 PICARD / (losing patience, to Orta) There will be no bloodshed...
 PICARD / Perhaps you could share them with me.
 PICARD / If you wish her to remain, I will agree, but she is not helping matters by fostering distrust between us...
 PICARD / I can assure you....
 PICARD / Deception?
 PICARD / Yes...
 WORF / ... he admits responsibility for dozens of attacks on Cardassian targets. Why should we believe him about Solarion Four?
 WORF / He fears our reprisal.
 TROI / I didn't perceive fear or deception from him.
 WORF / If they did not attack Solarion Four, who did? And why would anyone want to falsely implicate the Bajorans?
 DATA / Perhaps someone wanted to draw us into this conflict...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Ensign. May I see you in my ready room?
 PICARD / You do not leave this ship without authorization.
 PICARD / This is not a discussion. You're restricted to your quarters for the remainder of the mission.
 PICARD / Dismissed.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Ensign Ro has been confined to her quarters.
 PICARD / Guinan, I don't know why you are involved in this, but...
 PICARD / I have found that Guinan is very selective about whom she calls a friend. (a beat) Sit down.
 PICARD / What is it you can't do anymore, Ensign?
 PICARD / That part I know.
 PICARD / What kind of incentive... ?
 PICARD / I find that... almost impossible to believe. To suggest that Admiral Kennelly would consider sending weapons to terrorists...
 PICARD / You have been in contact with Admiral Kennelly during this mission?
 PICARD / Arming these people would be a violation of all that the Federation stands for. You cannot be blind to that...
 PICARD / Have you made this offer to Orta?
 PICARD / That was a wise choice, Ensign. It probably saved you from another court martial.
 PICARD / Have you briefed Admiral Kennelly since our return from the surface?
 PICARD / Then why did you come to me?
 PICARD / It seems we find ourselves with... something in common. (a thoughtful beat) Do you think Orta would cooperate with us to determine the truth here?
 PICARD / Good. (beat) Our orders were to find him, bring him back to the camps... any way we could... perhaps that is exactly what we should do.
 PICARD / And then watch what happens.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. I have become convinced that we are somehow involved in a conspiracy. I am hopeful the purpose behind it will be revealed in the next few hours.
 PICARD / It was a team effort, Admiral. Ensign Ro proved invaluable.
 PICARD / The Enterprise will escort a Bajoran Antares-class carrier to the Valo Three camp at oh-five hundred hours... Orta and his people will be aboard.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (beat) How's that Cardassian virus, Admiral?
 PICARD / Good. We will report as soon as our mission is accomplished. Picard out.
 RIKER / Ensign Ro, take us to the designated coordinates...
 PICARD / Mister Data...
 DATA / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / (thoughtful) Keep an eye on the Cardassian border, will you?
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 WORF / The Bajoran vessel is moving up from the surface, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Hail them, Mister Worf...
 WORF / Audio channel open... the ship has no visual capabilities.
 PICARD / This is Captain Picard, we are prepared to escort you to Valo Three...
 PICARD / Ensign Ro, set a course for Valo Three... half impulse.
 PICARD / Engage.
 DATA / I am monitoring increased activity inside Cardassian space... two ships are moving along the border... heading one-four-two mark zero-five-one...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, can you identify the class of these ships?
 WORF / Cardassian warships... Galor class, type three...
 RIKER / Top of the line...
 DATA / They are moving into a course parallel to our own, Captain.
 PICARD / Yellow alert. Continue to monitor them...
 RIKER / Ensign Ro, what's the closest we get to the Cardassian border on the current heading to Valo Three?
 RIKER / E-T-A?
 PICARD / That's where it will be.
 DATA / The Cardassian ships are changing course... they are crossing the border...
 WORF / They're increasing power to forward weapon grids...
 RIKER / Red alert.
 PICARD / Ensign Ro... change course to intercept the Cardassians... open channel to the Bajoran vessels...
 WORF / Open.
 PICARD / This is the Enterprise. We are moving to intercept two Cardassian warships... maintain your present course and speed.
 WORF / Cardassians are in visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / We are being hailed by the Cardassians...
 PICARD / Open a channel, Mister Worf.
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise... how can I help you?
 PICARD / I'm pleased to hear that, Gul Dolak, for all of us in the Federation value the peaceful relations with our Cardassian neighbors.
 PICARD / Good. Now that we've established our mutual good will... what's on your mind?
 PICARD / Terrorist carrier... are you certain?
 PICARD / Well, rest assured, there will be no terrorist attacks today. We are escorting these Bajoran settlers to the camp on Valor Three. You may monitor their course if you wish.
 PICARD / This is neutral space, Gul Dolak. You have no jurisdiction here.
 PICARD / If we withdraw, what do you intend to do to the Bajoran vessel?
 PICARD / I see. Well, that puts me in a difficult position. I've promised to escort these people to their camps.
 PICARD / (beat) I'm sorry to offend you, Gul Dolak. But I cannot withdraw.
 PICARD / Is that intended as a threat?
 PICARD / Advise Starfleet of our status, Mister Data. (beat, rising) When Admiral Kennelly calls, I'll speak to him in my ready room.
 PICARD / It seemed, Admiral, that they knew our course, our destination, our plan...
 PICARD / I'm not convinced of that...
 PICARD / Any suggestions, Admiral?
 PICARD / Sir, I see no way to protect the Cardassian peace without sacrificing the Bajorans.
 PICARD / No. I'm not willing to give them up.
 PICARD / Well, I just see a different big picture, Admiral... it looks something like this... (beat) I see the Cardassian liaison, with his Cardassian virus, coming to meet with you after the attack on Solarion Four. Now, we have a mutual enemy, he says. The Bajoran terrorists. The Cardassians can't find them. But maybe the Federation can. I am beginning to see that our mission has been, in fact, to expose Orta... so the Cardassians could move in and destroy him.
 PICARD / Ensign Ro, set a course, bearing one-eight-seven mark one-zero-two... one quarter impulse.
 RIKER / He ordered us to withdraw?
 WORF / The Cardassians are moving toward the Bajoran vessel, Captain.
 PICARD / Hold present course.
 WORF / The Bajoran ship has been destroyed.
 DATA / Subspace transmission coming from Starfleet, Captain. Admiral Kennelly.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / It is on a secure channel. Perhaps in your ready room, Captain?
 PICARD / No. Here. On screen.
 PICARD / The Cardassians have destroyed the Bajoran ship.
 PICARD / No, sir.
 PICARD / No, sir. No one was on board.
 PICARD / The ship was controlled from the ground. Communications were handled through a subspace relay aboard the vessel.
 PICARD / Actually, no... this was Ensign Ro's idea... but I fully endorsed it. I suspected that something like this might occur.
 PICARD / I am more concerned with protecting the honor and integrity of Starfleet.
 PICARD / The Bajorans did not attack Solarion Four.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / Admiral, Orta's ships are old and obsolete. They do not have warp capabilities. They could not have reached another star system... let alone attack one.
 PICARD / I would suggest you ask your friend the Cardassian liaison, Admiral. The only explanation I can think of is that the Cardassians staged it.
 PICARD / Perhaps they were hoping to find someone in Starfleet like you, Admiral, who would be foolish enough to solve their Bajoran problem for them.
 PICARD / I'm not sure. A hearing, definitely. Perhaps a court martial.
 PICARD / A few weeks. We have some surveying to do in sector two-one-three-oh-five.
 PICARD / Ensign, you were recruited for one mission and if you wish to be relieved of further duty, I will approve it. But I'd like you to consider remaining in Starfleet.
 PICARD / It would be a shame for Starfleet to lose someone with your potential.
 PICARD / That can change.
 PICARD / I've observed a certain quality about you that... might be harnessed, molded...
 PICARD / There's still a lot you can learn from Starfleet, Ensign.
 PICARD / (beat) That is an attitude I have found to be common among the best officers I've served with. (beat) You are not one of those officers, Ensign, but you might be someday... if you decide to work at it.
 PICARD / Condition... ?
 PICARD / Picard to Enterprise. Two to beam up.
 RIKER / (nodding) Looks good. At this rate you should be ready for the next wave of colonists in about six months. (eyeing the terrain) I have to say I envy you... this is a beautiful place to put down roots.
 RIKER / No? How do I strike you?
 RIKER / Ah. And aren't pioneers, like you, adventurers at heart?
 RIKER / Very interesting. I'd love to discuss this further with you. Dinner tonight?
 RIKER / Haven't we managed to get a replicator down here yet?
 RIKER / It's sounding better all the time...
 RIKER / My favorite part of dinner...
 BEVERLY (o.c.) / (calling) Will... Carmen...
 BEVERLY / We've been going over the schematics for the hospital. The location seems fine...
 RIKER / When the Enterprise comes back tomorrow, we'll bring a crew down here and get started.
 RIKER / Carmen... do you have some construction started I don't know about?
 RIKER / Data?
 DATA / I do not recognize the sound.
 DATA / I believe the sound is coming from above...
 RIKER / Maybe an atmospheric disturbance...
 RIKER / Data -- what's our best bet for cover?
 DATA / There are subterranean caverns beneath the hills to the east. (points) Approximately one kilometer.
 RIKER / Carmen, start rounding everybody up.
 RIKER / We've seen it before -- we know what it is. Now get moving!
 RIKER / Let's go! (calling) Beverly! This way!
 BEVERLY / Okay, people... stay calm... let's go...
 RIKER / Follow him! Follow him! Go!
 RIKER / Let's go!
 RIKER / This way! Stay together!
 RIKER / Carmen!
 PICARD, WORF, TROI, ENSIGN at the conn, and / SUPERNUMERARIES.
 WORF / Captain... sensors are indicating a disturbance near the outpost on Melona Four.
 PICARD / What kind of disturbance?
 WORF / I can't tell. We are still too far away. It could be an electrical storm...
 PICARD / See if you can make contact with the colony...
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / How far are we?
 WORF / At current speed, twenty-seven hours.
 WORF / Captain, I get no response from Melona colony. But the disturbance in the atmosphere is increasing.
 PICARD / Bridge to La Forge...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here, Captain.
 PICARD / Are you picking up readings from Melona?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. Something strange is going on... there are violent disruptions in the atmosphere...
 PICARD / Ensign... increase to warp eight.
 RIKER / Inside... keep moving, deep into the cave...
 RIKER / How much protection will this cave give us, Data?
 DATA / The presence of refractory metals in the rock formations may act as an effective barrier.
 RIKER / Let's seal this entrance.
 BEVERLY / I hope there's enough air in here.
 RIKER / There should be a ventilation source somewhere...
 RIKER / We need some light in here...
 RIKER / How are the others?
 BEVERLY / So far it looks like scrapes and bruises. Will... where's Carmen?
 RIKER / Carmen didn't make it.
 RIKER / She went back for someone... a man who'd fallen...
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry.
 RIKER / I think we'll be safe in here. I'm not sure about our air supply. Stay put and don't move around, don't expend unnecessary energy. With any luck we can wait this out.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise... Riker to Enterprise...
 DATA / Commander, the refractory metals in the rock strata might also interfere with communication.
 RIKER / Data... we've only seen the Crystalline Entity once before... how do you know these metals will protect us?
 DATA / I am not entirely certain they will.
 RIKER / That's what I was afraid you were going to say...
 WORF / Sir... the disturbance on Melona is becoming more intense.
 PICARD / Continue hailing the colony. All channels.
 TROI / Captain... the fact that they're not responding doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong. The atmospheric disturbance could be jamming the signal.
 PICARD / I know, Counselor.
 WORF / Still no response, sir.
 PICARD / Ensign, increase to warp nine. (to Worf) How long, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Six hours.
 BEVERLY / Commander... I have one man unconscious. We can't stay in here much longer...
 RIKER / If I open that entrance and it's still out there, we're dead.
 BEVERLY / If we stay here we'll be dead...
 DATA / It has been over an hour since we heard the Entity. It may be gone.
 RIKER / And it may be out there waiting for us.
 RIKER / Everybody stay back.
 WORF / Commander?
 RIKER / Lieutenant Worf... I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful sight.
 GEORDI / Good to see you're all right, Commander. What's happened here?
 RIKER / The Crystalline Entity paid us a visit. We lost two colonists but got the rest in here...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45122.3. We have notified Starfleet Command of our intention to pursue and investigate the Crystalline Entity. To that end, we have been joined...
 PICARD (V.O.) / ... by Doctor Kila Marr, a xenologist who has made studying the Entity her life's work.
 RIKER / Welcome to the Enterprise. I am Commander William Riker.
 RIKER / We're glad you're here.
 RIKER / That's right.
 RIKER / We were lucky.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Commander Data was there, yes.
 RIKER / I'd be happy to show you to your quarters --
 BEVERLY / ... and when we came out of the cave... there was nothing left. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (cont'd) / Everywhere we looked... there was just complete devastation... trees gone... nothing...
 DATA / Doctor, I ran a full spectrographic analysis, section by section. Trace elements confirm that it was the same entity which destroyed the colony on Omicron Theta.
 RIKER / There was no vegetation left... no insects. Not even soil bacteria. It left nothing.
 RIKER / It didn't spare everyone, Doctor.
 RIKER / If you'll check your reports, you'll find that two of the colonists didn't survive.
 DATA / Doctor, the cave in which we hid was carved from rock which possessed heavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium. We surmise that the Entity could not penetrate that barrier.
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / Commander Data, you will accompany the Doctor to the surface.
 DATA / Yes, sir. We can leave --
 PICARD / There is no one on this ship who is more knowledgeable of the Crystalline Entity than Commander Data. His birthplace was Omicron Theta.
 PICARD / If there are others you wish to have on your team, you are, of course, welcome to request their additional presence. (beat) But as captain, I think it is in the best interest of this investigation for you and Commander Data to work together.
 PICARD / Well?
 TROI / I don't think you need an empath to sense that woman's feelings. (MORE)
 TROI (cont'd) / There's hostility... that she seems to have transferred from Lore... to Data...
 TROI / Perhaps you shouldn't have forced her together with Data so soon.
 PICARD / If her discomfort is going to cloud her judgement... or preclude her doing her objective best... I want to find it out now.
 DATA / Doctor, there is evidence of residual bitrious matter in the soil. It was not present before the Entity's attack.
 DATA / Doctor Marr... you have made it quite clear that you are disturbed by my presence. However, I do not believe that we can accomplish the task we have been assigned if you continue to ignore me.
 DATA / Then I do not understand your lack of interest in the bitrious filaments I mentioned.
 DATA / As I have speculated, the presence of refractory --
 DATA / (studying his own tricorder) Were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium?
 DATA / Then perhaps it is the combination of the two metals which prevented the Entity --
 DATA / (puzzled) I do not understand.
 DATA / I cannot imagine what effect my being here would have had --
 DATA / You are suggesting I lured it here?
 DATA / No, Doctor.
 DATA / Ah. Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta, you assume that I am capable of the same behavior. But you are mistaken, Doctor. My programming is distinctly different from Lore's.
 DATA / I do understand. I am attempting to explain to you that it is impossible.
 DATA / That is true.
 DATA / Yes, Doctor.
 GEORDI / Okay... we've input all the data you collected on the surface...
 GEORDI / You handle that unit like a veteran, Doctor.
 DATA / Did you expect different results this time, Doctor?
 DATA / Doctor... have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation?
 DATA / We are seeing high-energy reactions that may show up in a gamma scan...
 GEORDI / ... and if they do... we might find a pattern -- a kind of marker the Entity left behind. Good idea, Data.
 DATA / If the Entity left a residual trace of antiprotons in the samples we collected, the gamma radiation scan would reveal that.
 GEORDI / Data, I'm getting the readout now.
 DATA / If we try a logarithmic scale, it will give us better resolution.
 GEORDI / There, Data... see it?
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / Would you care to see what the scan has produced, Doctor?
 GEORDI / So we know the Entity leaves antiprotons behind...
 GEORDI / Sure. The ship's lateral sensors can be set for gamma radiation.
 DATA / The thanks actually go to Doctor Clendenning on Omicron Theta who did the first experiments with gamma scans.
 DATA / That is correct. But I possess much of his knowledge. He was working with new detectors before the attack on Omicron Theta.
 DATA / It is true, Doctor. The contents of their journals and logs were transferred into my memory cells. The man who created me also experimented with scanning the synaptic patterns of the colonists' temporal lobes and programming them into my neural nets.
 DATA / To some degree. Doctor Soong hoped to provide me with an amalgam of the colonists' memories.
 PICARD / Can you project a course from it?
 DATA / Yes, sir. (at controls) There are two possible destinations. The Brechtian Cluster and the Argos system.
 PICARD / Is either populated?
 DATA / The Brechtian Cluster has two inhabited planets.
 PICARD / Ensign, set a course.
 PICARD / Reprogram the torpedoes, Mister Worf. (to Marr) Let's just hope we don't have to use them.
 PICARD / If it's possible to avoid firing on it, I would hope that --
 PICARD / Perhaps you should join me in my ready room.
 PICARD / We are not hunters, Doctor. Nor is it our role to exact revenge.
 PICARD / I'm not denying that it might become necessary to fire on it. But that would be a last resort.
 PICARD / I'm going to try to talk to it.
 PICARD / We know through our own experience that our shields will protect us from the Entity. As long as we are in no danger, I will make every effort to communicate.
 PICARD / If we can determine what its needs are, we might find other sources to supply it...
 PICARD / The sperm whale on Earth devours millions of cuttlefish as it prowls the ocean. It is not evil... it is simply feeding. The same may well be true of the Crystalline Entity.
 PICARD / There are those, Doctor, who would argue that the Crystalline Entity has as much right to be here as we do.
 PICARD / Mister Data has some theories about how to communicate with the Entity. Please confer with him.
 DATA / Come in.
 DATA / Not at all, Doctor.
 DATA / It is gracious of you to say, Doctor. But I have not been injured by you.
 DATA / That is true. I have experimented with producing vibrations in crystal by means of graviton pulses.
 DATA / Exactly.
 DATA / I will call up the results I have achieved so far and you can study them.
 DATA / I do not possess the minute-to-minute remembrances of each person there... although many of their more intense recollections are contained in my memory banks.
 DATA / (accessing) Marr... Raymond... called Renny. Yes. I do.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / Blame you?
 DATA / I am not aware of any blame against you.
 DATA / I am unaware of any negative thoughts he had about you. (beat, as though accessing) His personal journals indicated he was proud... that you were such a fine scientist.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Commander Data, Doctor Marr, report to the bridge immediately.
 PICARD / A distress call... from a ship called the Kallisko... it's being pursued by an unknown object.
 PICARD / How strong are your shields, Captain?
 PICARD / Do you carry weapons?
 PICARD / Kallisko, change course, take evasive action. Do whatever you can to outrun it.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... can you reestablish?
 WORF / No, Captain. There is no response.
 DATA (o.c.) / The Crystalline Entity is moving away.
 PICARD (o.c.) / Set a course for the Kallisko. Mister Riker, prepare an away team... I want you to check for survivors.
 RIKER / It was pretty much what we expected, Captain. No survivors...
 BEVERLY / Not a trace of anything that was ever alive. Not even the seeds in their greenery storage.
 DATA / Warp and impulse engines are down but they can be restarted. A skeleton crew could take the ship to a starbase.
 PICARD / We don't want to take the time now. Send a message to the nearest starbase to dispatch a crew.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, make certain we are still picking up the gamma radiation pattern of the Entity.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (to Doctor Marr) Have you and Commander Data made any progress in finding a means of communication?
 PICARD / Then please keep working. We may need it soon.
 DATA / Deck seventeen.
 DATA / Doctor... you have seemed preoccupied... since we surveyed the Kallisko.
 DATA / Not at all.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / It's still headed toward the Brechtian Cluster. We've reestablished our course.
 PICARD / Very well.
 PICARD / One more thing...
 PICARD / Starfleet will notify Carmen Davila's family of her death and return her personal effects. Would you care to include a letter?
 RIKER / Yes, sir. I'd like that.
 PICARD / Something more, Number One?
 RIKER / Permission to speak freely, sir?
 PICARD / Of course.
 RIKER / I've been thinking... maybe Doctor Marr is right. Maybe we should destroy the Entity.
 PICARD / And why do you think that?
 RIKER / It's killed thousands. It will undoubtedly keep on killing... unless we stop it. I don't want those deaths on my conscience.
 PICARD / Are you sure that's it? Or are you being influenced by personal feelings?
 RIKER / With all due respect, sir... I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost people on missions before. (beat) Carmen was a good friend. But that's not why I'm saying this.
 RIKER / If we take the time to try to communicate with this thing, we may lose our chance to destroy it. And I don't think we can risk that.
 RIKER / I'm going to write that letter to Carmen's family.
 DATA / We should program the bridge science station to vary the emissions we direct toward the Entity.
 DATA / That is true.
 DATA / I possess some vivid memories of sporting events... he played Parrises Squares with a group of his schoolmates...
 DATA / He was pleased to have won a championship emblem.
 DATA / Yes, Doctor.
 DATA / Your son's most intense thoughts seemed to revolve around a young woman named Janina...
 DATA / He enjoyed her... gentleness... her kindness... her... (struggles to find neutral words) ... her -- physical attributes...
 DATA / I would be happy to be of help.
 DATA / Yes, that is correct. But what would you want me to say?
 DATA / Many of his journal entries took the form of letters to his friends and family. I could access one of those.
 DATA / (as Renny) I took my last exam today... I think I did all right on everything except cellular biology. I know you think it's important, Mom... but I don't see how I'm ever gonna use this stuff.
 DATA / (as Renny) In a couple of weeks, a bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the mountains. The Wallaces said it would be okay with them as long as we have adult supervision... so don't worry -- they're watching out for me. They're really great people... I like them a lot. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (beat) But they're kind of serious... They don't have your sense of humor, Mom. (beat) I miss you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, stardate 45125.7. We are still in pursuit of the Crystalline Entity. Data and Doctor Marr are prepared to attempt communication with the being when we intercept it. I will admit to some uncertainty about the prospect... it could prove to be a scientific triumph... or a catastrophe.
 WORF / Sir, the Brechtian Cluster is now five light years away.
 RIKER / Are we still picking up the Entity's pattern?
 DATA / Yes, Commander. But sensors do not yet have a lock on its exact whereabouts.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 DATA / Commencing graviton emission now...
 GEORDI / No change in the sensor readings.
 DATA / Emissions now at ten pulses per second.
 WORF / Sir...
 WORF / A large mass... approaching at warp speed...
 PICARD / Full stop. Doctor Marr, continue emitting your signal. On screen, Mister Worf.
 RIKER / Shields up.
 DATA / Doctor... shall we change the frequency?
 DATA / Changing to twenty pulses per second...
 RIKER / What's it doing? Checking us out?
 PICARD / Possibly... just as we are checking it out.
 TROI / Is it... responding to us?
 DATA / Emissions at thirty pulses per second...
 GEORDI / Captain, I'm reading a transmission from the Entity... a series of graviton pulses...
 PICARD / Remarkable...
 DATA / Captain, there is a pattern emerging from its signals.
 PICARD / It's trying to communicate with us?
 DATA / I believe so... although it will take some time to decipher the patterns...
 PICARD / Then it's possible... communication... understanding...
 GEORDI / Graviton pulses from the Entity have stopped...
 TROI / Maybe it doesn't like what we're doing...
 PICARD / Return to the intermittent signal, Doctor...
 DATA / Doctor Marr?
 PICARD / Counselor... ?
 TROI / Something's wrong...
 DATA / Sir, the Entity is beginning to resonate... vibrations increasing rapidly...
 PICARD / Doctor, stop the transmission! That is an order --
 PICARD / Mister Worf, take charge of the Doctor. Mister Data, shut down that transmission.
 GEORDI / Vibration amplitude is increasing... it can't last much longer.
 DATA / I am unable to stop our graviton signal, Captain. Doctor Marr has isolated the access code.
 GEORDI / Maybe I can create an override sequence... shut it down from here.
 DATA / Resonance is approaching critical...
 GEORDI / I can override her program, but it's gonna take time --
 PICARD / Mister Worf... escort Doctor Marr to her quarters.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Captain... perhaps I should escort Doctor Marr...
 PICARD / Fine. But do not leave her unattended.
 DATA / Doctor... if you will come with me...
 DATA / I will stay with you, Doctor.
 DATA / There has been no predetermined limit placed on my existence.
 DATA / In what way, Doctor?
 DATA / I do not find such a file in your son's journals. However... from what I know of him by his writing and his memories, I do not believe he would be happy. He was proud of your career as a scientist, and now you have destroyed it. You say you did it for him, but he would not want that. Yes. He would be very sad now. (innocently hopeful) Does that help, Doctor Marr?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, stardate 45156.1. Our mission to Mudor Five has been completed and since our next assignment will not begin for several days, we are enjoying a welcome respite from our duties.
 RIKER, DATA, and WORF are clustered around O'BRIEN and / a pregnant KEIKO (about eight months along). O'Brien and Keiko have that proud-but-nervous look of expectant parents. While Data are Riker are very interested in Keiko's pregnancy, Worf looks exceptionally bored.
 RIKER / Wait. I've got it. How about... William. Now there's a name... William O'Brien. That has a nice ring to it.
 RIKER / He's going to be a hell of a gymnast.
 DATA / (to Keiko) May I?
 BEVERLY is talking to GEORDI near a large stack of / containers. This is a very large cargo bay and there is a door similar to the one in the shuttle bay that opens to space. This door is smaller and it is currently closed. The containers are marked "Hazardous" and Geordi has been checking over some manifests on a PADD.
 GEORDI / No.
 BEVERLY / Come on, Geordi
 GEORDI / No.
 BEVERLY / Just try it once. It's not as hard as you think. I'm telling you... you'll be terrific.
 GEORDI / "... I am the very model of a modern major general, I've information vegetable, animal and mineral... " (quickly embarrassed, to Beverly) I can't do this! I can't sing in front of people.
 BEVERLY / Yes you can! That was terrific! (she takes his arm) Now you were a little off pitch, but I think we can take care of that...
 TROI / Captain, I'd like to introduce the winners of the primary school science fair. This is Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson. They're here for their tour.
 PICARD / Hello.
 PICARD / I'm afraid not. (trying to make it sound fun) But... we will be visiting both the hydroponics and astrophysics laboratories.
 TROI / (to kids) I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time.
 PICARD / Well. If you'll come with me...
 PICARD / I want you all to know that we on the Enterprise are very proud of the science fair winners. Perhaps some of you will choose to pursue a career in Starfleet. I heartily urge you to do so.
 PICARD / Well, then. Ah... what did you do for your science projects?
 PICARD / I see. Very commendable. (to Jay Gordon) And you?
 PICARD / How interesting. And you --
 PICARD / (urgent) Hang on -- we're falling!
 MANDEL / (reading console) Sensors are picking up subspace distortions and high-energy particles directly to starboard.
 MANDEL / (urgent) There's another filament moving toward us, sir!
 TROI / (a little shaky) I'm all right.
 TROI / (to com) Medical team to the bridge.
 TROI / (continuing) Troi to sickbay. (beat) Troi to engineering. (beat) Counselor Troi to any crewmember, please acknowledge.
 TROI / (looks around) Where's Lieutenant Monroe?
 MANDEL / The turbolifts aren't working. (beat) We're trapped up here.
 PICARD / (very hoarse) Are you... (tries to clear throat, then louder) Are you children all right?
 PICARD / Picard to bridge. (beat) This is the captain. Can anyone hear me?
 PICARD / I don't know.
 PICARD / (firm) They're not dead. Communications are down, that's all.
 PICARD / We most certainly are not --
 PICARD / (firm) Listen to me!
 PICARD / (continuing) No one is going to die. The bridge will send a rescue party as soon as possible, so I want you to stop crying. Everything is going to be all right.
 TROI / I'm... not really familiar with that protocol.
 MANDEL / (reading the ops console) I've got partial sensors back on-line.
 MANDEL / (continuing) I'm picking up sporadic life-signs throughout the saucer section. There are definitely survivors.
 MANDEL / I'm sorry, Chief, but the readings aren't that specific.
 MANDEL / I'm not reading any life-signs in the drive section.
 MANDEL / (works) There's no way to know. Without the main computer, I can't run a diagnostic.
 TROI / There are a lot of people still alive... many of them are hurt... but I can't tell where they are.
 TROI / I'd appreciate... some suggestions.
 TROI / Very well.
 TROI / Yes. (beat) Mister Mandel, I'd like you to assist Ensign Ro.
 MANDEL / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / How do you feel?
 RIKER / Just lie still for a while. We'll get you to sickbay as soon as we can.
 RIKER / (to Data) Report.
 DATA / I have made a survey of all turbolifts and service crawlways on this deck. Our access to the bridge has been completely severed by emergency bulkheads.
 WORF / Sickbay?
 DATA / Heavy damage in section twenty- three-A has cut-off access to sickbay. I have ordered a security team to move all casualties on this deck to Ten Forward until further notice.
 RIKER / We should assume the worst... that everyone on the bridge is dead and no one is in control of the ship.
 DATA / In that circumstance, reestablishing control should be our top priority.
 RIKER / Agreed. Can we get to engineering?
 DATA / The direct route is blocked, but there might be a way to reach it through a starboard service crawlway.
 RIKER / Okay -- you and I will try to get there. Worf, this room is going to be filled with wounded in a few minutes and they're going to need help. I want you to remain in charge here.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / (to Data) Let's go.
 WORF / Bring her here!
 GEORDI / Okay... clear the power shunt... bypass the flow current... and...
 GEORDI / (frustrated, to Beverly) The computer still won't release the doors.
 BEVERLY / Can we force them open?
 GEORDI / We can try. There's an emergency hand actuator.
 BEVERLY / Geordi...
 GEORDI / (distracted) Yes?
 BEVERLY / (urgent) Geordi, this wall's hot.
 GEORDI / I'm all right. (beat, then he looks back at the wall panel) But I think we've got a new problem.
 GEORDI / One of the energy conduits must've ruptured and ignited the polyduranide inside the bulkhead. That's a plasma fire.
 BEVERLY / It's putting out a lot of radiation. We can't stay in here very long.
 GEORDI / We've got a bigger problem than that. (beat) The quaratum in these containers is used in emergency thruster packs. It's normally pretty stable stuff... but when you expose quaratum to radiation it has a way of... exploding.
 PICARD / The external power has been cut off.
 PICARD / I don't know.
 PICARD / Your name... is Marissa. Is that right?
 PICARD / How old are you?
 PICARD / Really? And the boys?
 PICARD / Well, I'm going to need a first officer to help me. You're the oldest... so that makes you Number One.
 PICARD / That's what I've always called my first officer. Here.
 PICARD / Now... we need a crew to help us get that hatch off.
 PICARD / Number One... I think Jay might make an excellent science officer. Don't you agree?
 PICARD / Will you join our crew, Jay?
 PICARD / Of course. Forgive me. Jay Gordon.
 PICARD / Let's see... your science project involved radishes, did it not?
 PICARD / Excellent. You'll be our executive officer in charge of radishes.
 PICARD / Now -- let's get to work.
 RIKER / Thirteen-sixty-five-baker. That should put us near shuttlebay two.
 DATA / That is correct, sir. We have approximately fifty-two meters remaining in this crawlway before we can safely exit into a main corridor.
 RIKER / Coolant leak!
 BEVERLY / We can withstand this level of radiation for another three or four hours without any permanent damage. (closes tricorder) But we'll need a few days of hyronalin treatments.
 GEORDI / What are the radiation levels in the quaratum?
 BEVERLY / They're at eighty-three rads and rising about four rads per minute.
 GEORDI / (depressed) That stuff gets unstable at around three hundred fifty rads. (stops working) I still can't get any power to this transporter.
 BEVERLY / The radiation levels are twenty percent lower at this end of the bay. Let's move the containers over here.
 GEORDI / (nods) That should buy us some time. (thinks) We're going to have to do this by hand. With this much radiation flying around in here we can't trust the anti-grav units.
 TROI / Yes. (beat) How big are these quantum filaments?
 TROI / (unsure) So, it's like a... cosmic string?
 TROI / (to Ro) What's our engine status, Ensign?
 TROI / Which means... ?
 DATA / The current cannot be shut down from this relay box.
 RIKER / (frustrated) We can't just sit here.
 DATA / If the energy flowing through this arc were interrupted by a nonconductive material, it is likely that the circuit would be broken.
 RIKER / (looks around) I don't see any material in here that could stop that much current.
 DATA / (thinks) Commander, most of my bodyframe is composed of tripolymers, a non- conductive material.
 RIKER / (surprised) You're suggesting using your own body?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Data, there's at least half a million amps flowing through that arc. Can you take that much current?
 DATA / The power surge would cause a system failure in most of my internal processors and melt my primary power couplings. However, there is a chance that the damage would not be irreparable.
 RIKER / No.
 DATA / Commander, our choices are very limited.
 RIKER / First of all, android or not, I won't allow anyone to take that kind of risk. Second, if the computer isn't working in engineering, I'm going to need your help to get control of the ship.
 DATA / (thinks) My positronic brain has several layers of shielding to protect it from power surges. It would be possible for you to remove my cranial unit and take it with you.
 RIKER / (shocked) You want me to take your head off?
 DATA / (surprised at the reaction) Yes, sir. (beat) Is there something wrong?
 RIKER / Well, Data... it's just... I mean, will you be all right?
 DATA / My neural nets and memory core are self-contained. (beat) I will be fine.
 RIKER / Like you said... our choices are very limited.
 RIKER / Data? Data!
 DATA / A remarkable experience, Commander.
 RIKER / How are you? Did the shielding work?
 DATA / (thinks) Apparently so. My neural nets are fully operational. (beat) You may begin by opening the ventral access panel located two centimeters beneath my right ear.
 PICARD / (strained) Feel around the edge of the illumination module -- of the big circle, until you find a small knob.
 PICARD / Now with your other hand, reach around the far side of the module... there should be another knob.
 PICARD / Good. Good. Pull both knobs out at the same time and then let go.
 PICARD / (continuing) Now push up... and slide the hatch over to the side.
 PICARD / Jay Gordon, can you pull yourself up?
 PICARD / Can you tell what deck we're on? There should be a large number on the wall of the shaft.
 PICARD / Good. Now look down at the side of the lift. Do you see two big clamps?
 PICARD / Can you see if both clamps are connected to a... long beam inside a... a big groove?
 PICARD / All right. Come down.
 PICARD / (softly) Number One, those big clamps are part of the emergency system. If something goes wrong, they're designed to hold the turbolift in place. (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / But they seem to have been damaged.
 PICARD / That's right. (beat, then intimate) When that clamp gives way, we'll fall. You're going to have to take your crew out of here before that happens. There's a ladder along the inside of the turboshaft. You can use it to climb up until you find an open doorway.
 PICARD / (honest) My leg is broken. I'll only slow you down and you need to move quickly. (a little firmly) You'll have to be the leader. That's an order.
 PICARD / I'm not going. Commander Marissa is in charge.
 PICARD / Patterson, you're an officer, now. You have to obey orders.
 PICARD / There's no time to argue, you have to go now.
 PICARD / All right. I'll try. But I want you to know... this is mutiny.
 PICARD / (continuing) Number One, look at that panel... do you see a bright yellow cap?
 PICARD / Pull the cap toward you and then turn it... it should come off.
 PICARD / (continuing) Good. Now, that bundle of wires... that's optical cabling... see how much you can pull out...
 BEVERLY / (disappointed) The levels are still rising.
 BEVERLY / There must be some way to put that thing out.
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) The energy's being fed by the ship's internal power grid and we can't even get near that. The only way to stop it would be to eliminate the supply of oxygen. (beat) Wait a minute...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Doctor, I've got an idea. It's pretty wild, but we might be able to kill two birds with one stone.
 BEVERLY / Let's hear it.
 GEORDI / If we open the external door it would depressurize the cargo bay, and blow all those containers out into space. At the same time, the lack of oxygen should knock out the plasma fire.
 BEVERLY / What about us?
 GEORDI / We'll have to find something in here to hang onto while the air is evacuated. After that, we'll shut the door and repressurize the bay.
 BEVERLY / This looks like it'll have to do.
 WORF / (to injured crewman) There will be a sharp pain as I set the bone. Prepare yourself.
 WORF / (continuing) Good... good. You bore that well.
 WORF / Perhaps you should lie down.
 WORF / I believe that is not uncommon in the late months of pregnancy...
 WORF / You cannot. This... this is not a good time.
 TROI / What do you suggest?
 TROI / (without turning around) You said there's no way to stabilize the containment field from the bridge. Could it be done from engineering?
 TROI / Could we divert energy from the bridge... to those monitors?
 TROI / I believe there are people still alive down there... and I'm going to give them every chance.
 TROI / Assuming they are alive, they'll be hoping there's someone up here to help them. So we'll help them. (to O'Brien Divert the necessary power to engineering.
 TROI / Thank you, Ensign. Proceed.
 PICARD / (to children) I can't open this door.
 PICARD'S VOICE / (continuing) We'll have to climb up to the next deck.
 PICARD / (firm) We're going up. Ready?
 PICARD / (urgent) The lift's falling! Hang on!
 PICARD / We're all right. We're going to keep climbing. Don't look down.
 PICARD / (to Patterson) We're right here with you, Patterson. You're not going to fall.
 PICARD / (continuing) Everything will be all right if you keep moving.
 PICARD / (continuing) What we need -- is a climbing song. Marissa, what's a song you sing in school?
 PICARD / I'm afraid I don't know that one. (beat) I know -- "Frere Jacques". We used to sing that when I was your age. Patterson, do you know that song?
 PICARD / It goes like this... "Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques... "
 WORF / Your contractions are now only twenty seconds apart.
 WORF / They will continue to come closer together until you reach the bearing down phase.
 WORF / Dilation has gone to nine centimeters since the onset of labor. (to Keiko) That did not take long.
 WORF / You are doing very well. I am sure the child will arrive soon.
 WORF / Turned... ?
 WORF / I am not certain. (beat) Can't you tell?
 WORF / (beat) No. But I have taken the Starfleet Emergency Medical Course. In a computerized simulation, I assisted in the delivery of a human baby.
 WORF / I am sure everything will be fine.
 BEVERLY / Once the air is vented, the first thing you'll feel is extreme pressure in your lungs... you'll have to resist the temptation to exhale. Next, your hands and feet will get cold, then numb... and some of the capillaries in exposed sections of skin may burst.
 GEORDI / (dry) Sounds like fun.
 BEVERLY / We'll have about fifteen seconds of useful consciousness left. After that, there's about ten seconds of extreme disorientation, then we pass out.
 GEORDI / (indicates panel on far wall) After the air has been evacuated, one of us will have to get to that panel and repressurize the bay.
 GEORDI / We're ready.
 TROI / Have you made preparations to separate the Saucer Section?
 TROI / What happened?
 TROI / We will separate the ship when I have decided that it's time, not before. Is that clear, Ensign?
 RIKER / Okay, try it.
 DATA (o.c.) / Very good, Commander. You have established the connection. I can now raise the door.
 RIKER / There's no power on the entire deck, but somehow these monitors are working.
 DATA / (thinks) Commander, the power reaching those monitors has been diverted from the bridge.
 RIKER / But why... ? (beat) Unless there's something they want us -- something they need us to see...
 RIKER / Data -- the containment field strength is down to eighteen percent!
 RIKER / (urgent) Can you stabilize it?
 DATA / (works) I do not have access to the containment field. You will have to establish a new link.
 DATA / Locate the ODN conduit.
 RIKER / Got it.
 DATA / You must now change the input matrix in my secondary optical port and then connect the ODN conduit.
 DATA / That is not the correct port, sir.
 RIKER / Sorry.
 DATA / Commander, you must hurry, the field has dropped to sixteen percent.
 RIKER / I'm trying. You need a bigger head.
 DATA / The field is still dropping -- collapse is imminent.
 RIKER / All right, try it!
 DATA / (thinks) I have a connection. (beat) I am now stabilizing the containment field.
 RIKER / That's using your head, Data.
 TROI / All right. Stand by to separate the Saucer Section --
 TROI / You could have just as easily been right.
 WORF / Congratulations. You are fully dilated to ten centimeters. (proudly) You may now give birth.
 WORF / Bearing down is the next stage. It should start at full dilation. Why has it not begun?
 WORF / My computer simulation was not like this. That delivery was very orderly.
 WORF / (hoping) Did you feel an uncontrollable urge to push?
 WORF / Good! You are bearing down. Now you must push with each contraction and I must urge you gently but firmly to push harder.
 WORF / Push, Keiko. Push hard...
 WORF / Push... push...
 WORF / The baby is emerging head first. One more contraction...
 WORF / That's good -- push... harder... (amazed) I have the baby!
 WORF / I will now smack the child to induce breathing --
 WORF / I believe she looks like Chief O'Brien.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are en route to Starbase Sixty-seven, to undergo repairs. Life aboard the Enterprise is slowly returning to normal.
 RIKER / (joking) Just can't stay away from the big chair anymore, can you?
 TROI / (right back at him) I don't think I'm cut out to be captain... first officer, maybe... I understand there aren't many qualifications.
 RIKER / (to com) Captain Picard to the bridge, please.
 RIKER / There are some visitors here to see you, Captain.
 PICARD / Hello. It's good to see you again. What brings you to the bridge?
 PICARD / Thank you, very much.
 PICARD / And you did a wonderful job. Later this afternoon, we'll finish the tour I promised you. (beat) Starting with the battle bridge.
 PICARD / I'll see you at fourteen hundred hours. (as he turns to go to the Ready Room) You have the bridge, Number One.
 RIKER & MARISSA / Aye, sir.
 RIKER is standing near a long screen_partition, / dressed in casual clothes (perhaps a robe), looking flushed with excitement. He calls out in a playful tone of voice.
 RIKER / Etana...
 RIKER / (continuing) I know you're back there... don't make me come after you.
 RIKER / (re: communicator) Give me that...
 RIKER / Yes... I... do...
 RIKER / Give it to me.
 RIKER / I can't believe you did that.
 RIKER / (re: device) What's this?
 RIKER / Do I keep my eyes open, or closed?
 RIKER / What am I seeing?
 RIKER / Now what?
 RIKER / Yeah...
 RIKER / How do I do this?
 RIKER / Got it.
 RIKER / (re: sensation) What was that?
 RIKER / How far does this game go?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45208.2. Commander Riker has rejoined the Enterprise from Risa. And we are on our way to an uncharted area called the Phoenix Cluster.
 PICARD, DATA, WORF, and SUPERNUMERARIES at positions. / VARIOUS CREWMEMBERS are working at the science stations. The bridge is alive with activity.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) We are all anticipating this historic first look at the region.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Things are getting busy around here. Five more science teams just beamed in from the Zhukov. Quarters are filling up fast.
 PICARD / (nods; concerned) And on top of everything, there's been a change. We now have only two weeks to complete the exploration.
 RIKER / Two weeks... that's not enough time to explore a region that size. I thought we had five weeks.
 DATA / (to Riker) Starfleet has added a diplomatic mission to Oceanus Four.
 PICARD / Will, I'm leaving it up to you to make sure all science departments have an equal chance to complete their research.
 RIKER / It'll be quite a juggling act.
 PICARD / A bit of good news, as well. We're to rendezvous with a shuttlecraft carrying Wesley Crusher. He's on vacation from the Academy.
 RIKER / Wesley... good. We'll need an extra hand around here.
 RIKER / Geordi... how are you coming with the survey preparations?
 GEORDI / I'm up to my neck in observation schedules right now.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Our biggest hurdle is sensor availability.
 RIKER / Especially since two new exobiologists and three stellar cartographers joined us from the Zhukov.
 GEORDI / Fifteen science teams, only two weeks, and one long-range array don't make a great combination.
 RIKER / What about the lateral sensors?
 GEORDI / They're booked solid for planetary observation.
 RIKER / And the gamma ray scanner?
 GEORDI / We're reprogramming it now... (to Robin) Lefler... will you join us, please?
 GEORDI / You know Robin Lefler.
 RIKER / Of course.
 GEORDI / Her performance around here has been sensational. I've decided to make her a mission specialist.
 RIKER / (to Robin) Congratulations.
 RIKER / Okay, specialist -- what's our sensor status?
 RIKER / Will it be ready by the time we arrive?
 RIKER / Keep it up, Lefler.
 RIKER / Geordi... I brought something back from Risa. You've got to try it.
 GEORDI / I'd love to. But I'm running a full sensor recalibration in ten minutes. Can it wait?
 RIKER / Sure. I'll catch up with you later.
 RIKER / (re: sundae) Chocolate ice cream. Chocolate fudge. Chocolate chips. You're not depressed, are you?
 TROI / I'm fine, Commander.
 RIKER / (re: sundae) Did you want to be alone with that?
 TROI / No. You can join us.
 RIKER / I don't like fudge.
 TROI / Really. I never met a chocolate I didn't like.
 RIKER / Doesn't it taste good?
 TROI / Of course it does. But it's not just a matter of taste. It's the whole experience.
 TROI / First you spoon the fudge from around the rim... leaving only ice cream in the middle... (eats a bite) Then gently spoon the ice cream around the sides, like you're sculpting it... (MORE)
 TROI (cont'd) / (another bite) Relish every bite. Make every one an event. And on the last bite, close your eyes...
 RIKER / I never knew it was a ritual.
 TROI / Chocolate is a serious thing.
 RIKER / You know... I brought something back from Risa. It's better than chocolate.
 TROI / Oh... what is it?
 RIKER / Just a game.
 WESLEY / Chief O'Brien!
 WESLEY / Congratulations on little Molly.
 WESLEY / So... where is everyone? Is my mom around?
 WESLEY / Oh. Well, do you think it'd be alright if I stopped by... just to say hi?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge here.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / That is acceptable.
 WESLEY / Thanks.
 BEVERLY / (hugging Wesley) Welcome home.
 WESLEY / Thanks, Mom.
 PICARD / Wesley...
 WESLEY / Captain...
 PICARD / Quomodo tua Latinitas est? (How's your Latin?)
 WESLEY / Praestat quam prius. (It's better than before.)
 PICARD / Oppido bonum. (Very good.) Your Latin has improved.
 TROI / You're looking very handsome.
 BEVERLY / You do that cadet uniform justice, Wesley.
 GEORDI / Bet you drive the girls wild.
 WORF / (re: cake) Tarvokian pound cake. I made it myself.
 WESLEY / Thanks, Worf.
 DATA / Wesley -- was our attempt to make you uncomfortable effective?
 WESLEY / You bet it was. For a second there, I thought I was on the wrong ship.
 DATA / And you found the deception pleasurable?
 WESLEY / Well... yeah. It's fun to be surprised.
 RIKER / (with humor) Are you here to work or play, Mister Crusher?
 WESLEY / Sir?
 RIKER / I know you're on vacation. You'll probably want to sleep late, and go to the holodeck. But if you'd like to help out, we could use an extra hand in preparing for the Phoenix Cluster survey.
 WESLEY / That'd be great, sir.
 GEORDI / After you're settled, come down to engineering. We'll get you started.
 WESLEY / Aye sir.
 BEVERLY / What kind of game?
 TROI / Come by my quarters, and I'll show it to you...
 DATA / Have you found the Academy challenging, Wesley?
 WESLEY / After the Enterprise, I thought it would be a breeze... but there's a lot more to learn besides starship operations. (beat) How was your first year?
 DATA / Although I did extremely well scholastically, my lack of Human understanding often created social obstacles.
 WESLEY / Like what?
 DATA / I particularly recall a phenomenon called practical jokes, several of which I fell victim to.
 WESLEY / Tell me about it. My first week there, a guy named Adam Martoni reprogrammed the sonic shower to cover me with mud. It took me a while, but I got him back pretty good...
 DATA / I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, an Academy tradition, something called the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
 WESLEY / Yeah... they still hold it every year.
 DATA / It was a notably awkward experience.
 WESLEY / (smiles) Don't worry, Data... I can't dance either.
 DATA / Really? Your mother is quite an expert. She recently taught me.
 WESLEY / Yeah, I know. "The Dancing Doctor." She tried to teach me. I just don't seem to have the knack.
 DATA / I would be happy to give you lessons while you are here on vacation. I have created a comprehensive seventeen part course with some interesting holographic dancing partners. Several members of the crew have become quite proficient...
 WESLEY / (interrupts) I'll let you know, Data.
 WESLEY / I'll try modifying the planetary scanners.
 GEORDI / Just make sure we keep enough data lines open for stellar physics.
 WESLEY / No problem. I'll compress the signal flow...
 WESLEY / (to himself, re: console) Now why won't these register... ?
 WESLEY / Excuse me?
 WESLEY / (studies console) Are you kidding? It's gotta be done by the computer.
 WESLEY / It's working...
 WESLEY / (continuing) Thanks.
 WESLEY / I'm Wesley, by the way... Wesley Crusher.
 WESLEY / That's right.
 WESLEY / Hi.
 WESLEY / What? Oh!
 DATA / A conflict has started between the planetary evolution team and the stellar physicists. Both wish to use the thermal imaging array first.
 GEORDI / Well... tell them to flip a coin. They've got to cooperate on this mission, or we'll never get it done.
 DATA / A coin. Very good. I will replicate one immediately.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Data.
 DATA / Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Do you have a minute to join me in sickbay?
 DATA / Yes, Doctor. I am on my way.
 DATA / You wanted to see me, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Yes, Data. I need your help with something.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I'm running a new experiment on bioactive silicon. Would you reprogram the tricorder to these specifications?
 DATA / Certainly.
 BEVERLY / Sorry to bother you with this, but I need it done quickly.
 DATA / It does not bother me. In fact, I am happy to --
 RIKER / Computer -- secure sickbay.
 WESLEY / Let's see... I had Novakovich for anthropology... and Horne for creative writing...
 PICARD / Walter Horne... is he still teaching?
 WESLEY / And you'll be happy to know, I took your advice. The first week I was there, I went to meet Boothby.
 PICARD / Is he still tending the grounds... or has age finally caught up with him?
 WESLEY / Not that I can tell. He took me on a grand tour... showed me every single blade of grass, practically.
 PICARD / I got the very same tour...
 WESLEY / Sir... what do the initials S-P stand for?
 PICARD / S-P...
 WESLEY / Boothby said he once found you carving those initials into his prized elm tree.
 PICARD / Oh... just an old acquaintance.
 PICARD / (continuing) Wesley. If you meet someone whose initials you might want to carve into the elm tree, try not to let it interfere with your studies. (beat) I failed organic chemistry because of S-P.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I need you in sickbay immediately.
 PICARD / On my way.
 BEVERLY / (re: Data) He came in to complain about a servo malfunction. My scans were coming out negative. And then he just... collapsed.
 PICARD / What have you found?
 BEVERLY / His biosystems and positronic functions seem to check out. And his power cells are active...
 GEORDI / From what I can tell, his higher functions are intact. But the signals aren't getting from his brain to the rest of his body. It's like he's in a coma.
 RIKER / Data performs self-diagnostic routines on a regular basis. We should take a look at his logs -- they might tell us something.
 GEORDI / I recommend searching his quarters, as well. You never know what might turn up.
 PICARD / Agreed. Continue your analysis. Keep me informed.
 RIKER / (re: tricorder) Standard security sweep shows nothing out of the ordinary.
 GEORDI / (off console) Personal logs, diagnostics, duty logs... they all look normal. No evidence of anything leading to Data's shutdown.
 RIKER / (lightly) Maybe we should ask his cat.
 GEORDI / I'd better get back to sickbay. See if there's any change in his condition...
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher's got a handle on it, Geordi. You'd be the first person she'd call...
 GEORDI / I guess so...
 RIKER / Looks to me like you need a break... unwind a little.
 GEORDI / Maybe you're right.
 RIKER / I know just the thing. (beat) Why don't you meet me in Ten Forward? I've got something I want you to try.
 WESLEY / Conduits twelve and twenty-two are still down for testing.
 WESLEY / You have a funny way of looking at conduit configuration. But it works.
 WESLEY / What are these laws you keep talking about?
 WESLEY / How many laws do you have?
 WESLEY / Don't worry, it'll be on-line in a few minutes. I'm way ahead of you.
 WESLEY / Why do I get the feeling you already know me?
 WESLEY / (awkward) Uh... there's another side to that story...
 WESLEY / This isn't fair. I know nothing about you.
 WESLEY / ... isn't always fair. I know that law.
 WESLEY / I've gotta go work on the sensor relays. But later, I want a chance to even the score. (beat) Ten Forward, nineteen hundred hours. Will you join me for coffee?
 PICARD (v.o.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We have arrived at the Phoenix Cluster, but it will take us several hours to determine the best possible location from which to conduct our survey. In the meantime, Commander Data's condition remains unchanged, with no further indication as to the cause of his breakdown.
 BEVERLY'S POV - THE GAME (OPTICAL) / 
 WESLEY / Mom?
 BEVERLY / Wesley...
 WESLEY / What are you doing?
 BEVERLY / (re: game) I'm embarrassed to say this was meant for you. But it's so much fun, I couldn't resist.
 WESLEY / What is it?
 BEVERLY / A game. Will Riker brought it back from Risa.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Everybody's playing it. Would you like to try?
 WESLEY / Maybe later. (beat) Any word on Data?
 BEVERLY / Geordi's still working on him. He's going to be fine.
 WESLEY / Maybe I should give Geordi a hand...
 BEVERLY / No, Wes. This is your vacation. You're doing more than enough already.
 WESLEY / I guess you're right.
 BEVERLY / Are you in a hurry?
 WESLEY / Well, actually... I'm running behind schedule for a dinner date.
 BEVERLY / Really. With who?
 WESLEY / Robin Lefler -- from engineering.
 BEVERLY / Why don't you invite her over? We can all play the game together. I'll replicate a couple more.
 WESLEY / Mom...
 BEVERLY / (sweetly) Sorry. I just want to spend some time together while you're here.
 WESLEY / We'll spend lots of time together. I promise.
 BEVERLY / (smiles warmly) Okay. (beat) Come on, just one game. Try it on for size...
 WESLEY / (continuing) I need to change now.
 BEVERLY / Have a good time.
 WESLEY / Thanks.
 WESLEY / Really? Mine was a warp coil.
 WESLEY / Sounds lonely.
 WESLEY / And now you're here.
 WESLEY / I'm glad.
 WESLEY / Game?
 WESLEY / Have you played it?
 WESLEY / My mom has one. She was trying to get me to play it.
 WESLEY / It's strange, don't you think? Everybody playing it all the time...
 WESLEY / (curious) I wonder how it works?
 WESLEY / I'd want to know more about it first. (beat) We could hook it up to a computer. The medical programs can simulate human brain responses...
 WESLEY / Okay... I've loaded the neurological behavior program.
 WESLEY / This sensor pad should allow the computer to process whatever information the game throws at it.
 WESLEY / (off console) Heavy synaptic activity... all over the place...
 WESLEY / Speed up the processor and we'll find out.
 WESLEY / Computer, enhance frontal lobe -- full spectrum.
 WESLEY / ... The pleasure center of the brain. Whatever this game does, it must feel pretty good.
 WESLEY / Wait a second... look at this. Serotonin levels are way off. Let's do a neurochemical analysis...
 WESLEY / Correct me if I'm wrong, but this looks like a psychotropic reaction.
 WESLEY / (points) What's going on in the prefrontal cortex?
 WESLEY / Yeah... it sure does.
 WESLEY / (continuing) I'd better talk to the captain.
 PICARD / Come.
 WESLEY / Sorry to bother you, Captain.
 PICARD / No bother at all, Wesley, please...
 PICARD / (continuing) How are the survey preparations coming along?
 WESLEY / Fine, sir... but that's not why I'm here.
 PICARD / Oh... why then?
 WESLEY / There's a game going around... something Commander Riker brought back from Risa. A little device that hooks around the ear...
 PICARD / Yes, I've seen it.
 WESLEY / I did some preliminary tests on the game. What I found leads me to believe it may have harmful side effects. Specifically sir -- I think it's psychotropically addictive.
 PICARD / Addictive... What have you discovered?
 WESLEY / The game initiates a serotonin cascade in the frontal lobe of the brain. Now I know that's nothing conclusive... but it could be the reason people are so attracted to it.
 WESLEY / And at the same time, it seems to be stimulating the brain's reasoning center... I don't know what that's all about...
 PICARD / We'll start an investigation immediately. Thank you, Mister Crusher.
 PICARD / (continuing) And Wesley...
 PICARD / (continuing) Good to have you back.
 WESLEY / Thank you, sir.
 WESLEY (o.s.) / Robin...
 WESLEY / (continuing) Sorry.
 WESLEY / Me too. I was stopped twice in the corridor. (MORE)
 WESLEY (cont'd) / (beat) I spoke with Captain Picard. He's going to look into it.
 WOMAN / Did you forget your games?
 WOMAN / Well then... you can use mine.
 WESLEY / (stern) She said no thanks.
 WESLEY / (continuing) There's something else bothering me about all this -- if the game is addictive... there's only one person on the ship we can be sure wouldn't be affected by it...
 WESLEY / Right. And he just happened to get injured at the same time this game was brought on board.
 WESLEY / (continuing) I think we should take a look at him.
 WESLEY / (re: Data) I don't know what to make of this. There's brain activity... all his systems seem to be working.
 WESLEY / There might be a signal breach somewhere... between his brain and his body. Let's map his nervous system... see if we can isolate a weak link...
 WESLEY / Still nothing... (finds something) Here.
 WESLEY / (continuing) The signal stops here. Below his cognitive processor. (reads tricorder) There's some kind of damage... almost undetectable... (indicates viewscreen) Turn on the viewer.
 WESLEY / It looks like some of his positronic links have been severed.
 WESLEY / Only two people on board know enough about Data to have done something like this. Commander La Forge... and my mother.
 WESLEY / Maybe there's more going on here than we thought. Someone could be trying to use the game -- for some purpose other than pleasure...
 WESLEY / And everybody has. Except us.
 WORF / We've reached the designated coordinates, Captain. There is a ship bearing three-two-seven mark one-five-two on an intercept course.
 PICARD / Advise them of our status, Mister Worf.
 PICARD / Go replicate what you need. See that the devices are properly distributed.
 PICARD / (continuing; an afterthought) And don't forget Mister Crusher.
 BEVERLY / Wesley?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Wesley?
 WESLEY (o.s.) / In here, Mom.
 WESLEY / Better keep the mock-ups with us. (beat) We can't trust anyone now. Not even the captain.
 WESLEY / When you get there, start accessing the codes for the security tracking system. There's something I want to try...
 WESLEY / You too.
 WORF / The vessel is approaching, Captain.
 PICARD / All senior officers report to the bridge. (beat) On screen.
 PICARD / The Enterprise has been secured. We await your further instructions.
 PICARD / We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to Starfleet Academy.
 WESLEY / (to turbolift) Deck thirty-six.
 WESLEY / (to Robin) I think we're gonna be okay. I've just got one more thing to do...
 WESLEY / (continuing) Help me compile the forcefield overrides...
 WESLEY / I created a site to site transporter program. If things get difficult, this'll keep us one step ahead... (beat) Did you get a chance to access the security tracking codes?
 WESLEY / Robin... ?
 RIKER / (quickly) Computer -- activate security containment field on deck thirty-six, section fifty-two!
 WESLEY / Computer -- transport program Crusher One!
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to bridge. We've lost Crusher. It looks like he rigged a site to site transport.
 PICARD / Security alert, condition three. Computer, shut down all transporter systems and shuttle bays. (continuing) Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / (off console) I can't track him, sir. He's done something to the internal security sensors. I'll try bypassing his subcommands. Hold on...
 GEORDI / I'm picking up a piece of his trail, sir -- sensors show power activation in transporter room three. That would put him somewhere on deck six.
 PICARD / Seal off deck six. Activate security fields on section twenty- three through twenty-nine.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / We've got him, Captain -- section twenty-five. It looks like he's trying to break through the forcefield with a phaser.
 PICARD / Security to deck six, section twenty-five.
 RIKER / Where the hell is he?
 WORF / I am attempting to isolate him with thermal sensors...
 RIKER / Narrow the scan field. Go deck by deck if you have to...
 WORF / Unfortunately, he knows our procedures... he will avoid corridors and public areas...
 WORF / I am reading an unidentified heat source on deck seven, section twenty-three... (points) There...
 PICARD / You gave us quite a chase, Mister Crusher.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Doctor Crusher...
 PICARD / Hold him steady.
 BEVERLY / It's okay, Wesley. It doesn't hurt. You'll like it. I promise you...
 WESLEY / No...
 PICARD / (a command) His eyes.
 WESLEY / No...
 BEVERLY / That's it, Wesley... just let yourself go...
 DATA (o.s.) / Computer, resume normal illumination.
 DATA / (quickly) Mister Worf, you will find a small alien ship off the starboard bow. Secure it with a tractor beam and raise our shields.
 WORF / Engaging tractor beam.
 DATA / (to Picard) Are you all right, Captain?
 PICARD / I think so...
 WORF / Captain, we are being hailed by the alien vessel.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / The explanation is simple -- your attempt to capture this ship has failed.
 RIKER / Tactical analysis, Mister Worf?
 WORF / (off console) Their weapons capability is substantially inferior to ours. They are not a threat.
 RIKER / Get her off the screen.
 GEORDI / (shaken) I can't believe what we were about to do...
 RIKER / Data... we deactivated you...
 WESLEY / (to Riker) I managed to reconnect his positronic matrix.
 DATA / Wesley's subsequent diversions gave me adequate time to modify the palm beacon... (re: beacon) The optical burst patterns we programmed were successful in counteracting the addictive effects of the game.
 PICARD / (to Data) And the rest of the crew?
 DATA / We have programmed the main computer to transmit the same optical pulse to all display screens, work stations and terminals throughout the ship.
 RIKER / That'll reach almost everyone. Send out medical teams to treat the rest.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 PICARD / We'll take the alien vessel to the nearest Federation starbase. Ensign, lay in a course.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45212.1. We have delivered the Ktarian vessel to Starbase Eighty-two. We are now on a course to rendezvous with the Starship Merrimack, which will take Wesley Crusher back to the Academy now that his vacation is over...
 WESLEY / Who started that birthmark rumor, anyway?
 WESLEY / Me too.
 WESLEY / Somebody's got to kill those rumors you keep hearing about me.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Mister Crusher, we've rendezvoused with the Merrimack. (MORE)
 RIKER'S COM VOICE (cont'd) / Please report to transporter room two.
 WESLEY / (taps communicator) On my way, sir.
 WESLEY / (continuing) I'd better go.
 WESLEY / Law number one hundred and three...
 WESLEY / A couple of light years can't keep good friends apart.
 PICARD / That was to be my question for you, sir.
 PICARD / On the contrary, Starfleet is most concerned. You are in a position to compromise the security of the Federation...
 PICARD / That will not be satisfactory.
 PICARD / And I cannot return without a full explanation. (beat) Ambassador, with the greatest respect for all you've achieved on behalf of the Federation, this sort of cowboy diplomacy is not easily tolerated any more...
 PICARD / If you wish to undertake a mission with potential repercussions to the Federation, it is appropriate to discuss it with the Federation. I am here as their representative. You will have to discuss it with me.
 PICARD / I also have the responsibility of bearing some unhappy news.
 PICARD / It was an honor. He was a great man.
 PICARD / I was with him before coming here. He expressed his pride in you, his love...
 PICARD / No, the feelings were in his heart, Spock. He shared them with me. I know.
 PICARD / Reunification... After so many centuries... so many fundamental differences that have evolved between your peoples...
 PICARD / What is this "first step" that Pardek suggests... ?
 PICARD / Why would you not bring something this important to the attention of your own people or the Federation?
 PICARD / History is aware of the role you played, Ambassador.
 PICARD / Ambassador, your logic escapes me. If I didn't know better, I would say your judgment had been influenced by emotion.
 PICARD / I speak as a Starfleet officer and I cannot ignore the risks to you...
 PICARD / Nevertheless, sir, I am not prepared to leave until your affairs are completed.
 PICARD / Then, sir, I am in good company.
 DATA / Captain Picard regrets that he must detain you but it is necessary for a while longer. In addition, I will be requiring access to your ship's computer...
 DATA / I am going to attempt to penetrate the Romulan Central Information Net...
 DATA / I have unique skills that may permit me to succeed.
 DATA / Your entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart. And Captain Picard has authorized me to share with you any information we obtain from the Romulan data banks...
 DATA / We will also need to communicate with the Enterprise in sector two-thirteen.
 DATA / Using conventional means, that would be true; however I propose that we piggy-back our signal on Romulan subspace transmissions...
 DATA / A Human metaphor, pardon me. We would use a Romulan signal as a carrier for own own, thus disguising its origin.
 DATA / I believe it will. During the last hour, I have conducted a systematic review of the entire Romulan subspace grid and compared my findings with the specifications of your transmission array. It would appear they are compatible.
 DATA / Thank you for your cooperation.
 PICARD / Just how widespread is this movement?
 PICARD / Serious enough for the leaders to suddenly embrace a Vulcan peace initiative? I have a difficult time accepting that.
 PICARD / I will be the first to cheer when the Neutral Zone is abolished, sir. I only wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshape the entire Romulan political landscape.
 PICARD / Hello, D'Tan...
 PICARD / These people are no one's enemy, Senator.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, stardate 45245.8. The Enterprise remains at Qualor Two as we continue to investigate the theft of a surplus Vulcan ship and materiel.
 RIKER (V.O.) / The trail has led us to the former wife of a deceased smuggler.
 RIKER / Same one I've always had.
 RIKER / Know the blues?
 RIKER / Never cared for it.
 RIKER / Who says I'm looking for anybody?
 RIKER / Okay. I'm looking for you.
 RIKER / I have to ask you about your husband.
 RIKER / The dead one, I'm afraid.
 RIKER / (acknowledges with regret) He fired first.
 RIKER / He was involved in some pretty bad business. And he took the evidence with him.
 RIKER / I was hoping you might know his business partners.
 RIKER / To be honest, I can't think of a good reason.
 RIKER / I don't carry money.
 RIKER / Slide over.
 RIKER / You know this one?
 RIKER / Early 20th century, from a place on Earth called Memphis... (off her reaction) ... maybe I could teach you a new lick or two...
 RIKER / So, whattaya say?
 RIKER / I can be.
 PICARD / I can't imagine that one rises to the position of Senate Proconsul without the support of the Romulan traditionalists.
 PICARD / Then, how can he turn his back on them so easily? How can he endorse reunification when it is considered subversive?
 PICARD / Perhaps they are hoping to use this to expose members of your movement...
 PICARD / That is not true...
 PICARD / You let their emotions sway you...
 PICARD / You are as skeptical as I am... is it logical to ignore your own good sense... ?
 PICARD / That is the second time you have accused me of speaking with another man's voice. (beat) Yes, he will always be a part of me. His experiences. His spirit. But I speak with my own voice, Spock. Not his.
 PICARD / Is it so important for you to win one last argument with him?
 PICARD / (compassionate) Your fight with Sarek is over. And you have none with me.
 PICARD / Even if it leads you into a Romulan trap...
 PICARD / Have you had any success, Mister Data?
 DATA / Negative, Captain. The Romulan Information Net employs a progressive encryption lock... I have been unable to penetrate their security measures.
 DATA / By all means, Ambassador.
 DATA / Yessir, the twenty-ninth is the only one I cannot bypass...
 PICARD / I think I'll take this opportunity to remove my ears...
 DATA / In what manner?
 DATA / Interesting. I have never considered that. And Captain Picard has been a role model in my quest to be more Human.
 DATA / Yes, Ambassador.
 DATA / You are half Human...
 DATA / And yet you have chosen a Vulcan way of life...
 DATA / In effect, you have abandoned what I have sought all my life.
 DATA / Ambassador, may I ask a personal question?
 DATA / As you examine your life, do you find you have missed your humanity?
 DATA / "No regrets." That is a Human expression.
 WORF / Do you know any Klingon opera?
 WORF / Surely, you must know at least one theme from "Aktuh and Maylota".
 WORF / MAYLOTA... MAAAY-LOT-A...
 WORF / (quietly) Worf to Enterprise.
 RIKER / Go ahead.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / A fat Ferengi has just entered the establishment.
 RIKER / Is that "Melor Famagal" I hear?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / It is.
 RIKER / I'm on my way.
 RIKER / Is there a problem?
 RIKER / Use your sleeve.
 RIKER / (re: one of the girls) Or use her sleeve, I don't care.
 RIKER / Commander William Riker, the U.S.S. Enterprise.
 RIKER / We're investigating the disappearance of a Vulcan ship...
 RIKER / We know you were involved...
 RIKER / Who would want a Vulcan ship?
 RIKER / Hypothetically speaking.
 RIKER / (calmly) Let me explain what's going to happen if you don't tell me about that Vulcan ship. Your passage rights through this sector will be revoked. But more than that, I'll be very unhappy.
 RIKER / At what coordinates?
 RIKER / Coordinates?
 RIKER / Enjoy your dinner.
 RIKER / As soon as I heard this Barolian ship was at Galorndon Core, I started to think Romulans...
 PICARD / And the Romulans are suddenly very interested in bonding with the Vulcans... Spock has been meeting with the new Senate Proconsul about reunification...
 RIKER / Reunification... ?
 PICARD / The Proconsul says he is prepared to endorse peace talks...
 RIKER / And Spock?
 PICARD / The Ambassador is skeptical but he cares a great deal about reunification. As long as there's a chance of success, he will pursue it.
 TROI / I'm afraid I don't see where a stolen Vulcan ship fits into all this...
 PICARD / Neither do I, Counselor. (beat) How soon can you be at Galorndon Core, Number One... ?
 RIKER / (presses some panels, checking) Little over eight hours.
 PICARD / It may be a wild goose chase, but I don't think we have a choice, do you?
 RIKER / Agreed.
 DATA / We're losing our Romulan carrier wave, sir...
 PICARD / We'll advise you further when you get there, Number One. Picard out.
 RIKER / (to conn) Ensign, set a course to Galordon Core, take us to warp eight.
 DATA / Captain, the Romulan subspace logs identify a transmission from the Romulan surface to a Barolian ship near Galorndon Core twelve hours ago.
 DATA / This would not appear to be routine. I have been able to trace the source of the transmission. It incorporates the code prefix of Romulan intelligence.
 PICARD / Can you access it, Data?
 DATA / It appears to be a short sequence of numbers. One four zero zero.
 PICARD / Nothing else?
 DATA / Nossir.
 PICARD / (beat) I want to advise the Ambassador immediately... Mister Data, you will accompany me to the surface...
 PICARD / Captain, maintain an emergency transport schedule at our beam-in coordinates...
 PICARD / P'tah Jol Ginquol! Katah! You will lock on those coordinates at sixty minute intervals after our arrival.
 DATA / (to Picard) That was not very Vulcan of you, sir.
 PICARD / The only communication that was sent were the numbers one-four- zero-zero.
 DATA / How do you know that, Ambassador?
 DATA / Lieutenant Commander Data.
 RIKER / Any signs of life, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / Negative, Commander.
 TROI / The Romulans could have a cloaked base on the surface...
 RIKER / (acknowledges) Or anywhere else along the Neutral Zone.
 WORF / Sir, a coded subspace signal from Romulus... it's the Captain...
 TROI / What...
 RIKER / "Maintain position at Galorndon Core. Diplomatic initiative appears to be succeeding. Will advise soon."
 WORF / The message did employ the proper code sequence, Commander.
 RIKER / (with concern) Yeah. I'm sure it did.
 DATA / Perhaps you would be happier in another job.
 PICARD / A "peace" envoy in a stolen Vulcan ship...
 PICARD / The moment those Vulcan ships appear in the Neutral Zone, the Enterprise will move to intercept...
 PICARD / Can you possibly believe that the Federation will not immediately intervene?
 PICARD / This will hardly convince anyone.
 PICARD / Suggestions?
 DATA / I believe so, sir.
 WORF / Commander, sensors are picking up three vessels crossing the neutral zone... Vulcan ships...
 TROI / (reacts) Vulcan...
 RIKER / What's their heading, Mister Worf... ?
 WORF / One-four-three mark zero one two...
 GEORDI / (checking sensors) That would put them on a course to Vulcan... they don't seem to be in any hurry... they're only moving at warp one, Commander...
 RIKER / Worf, signal them on subspace... request their status... Geordi, see if you can tell if one of them is the ship we've been looking for.
 WORF / They say they're escorting a peace envoy from Romulus to Vulcan, sir... They request that we monitor Federation subspace channels. Ambassador Spock will be making an announcement shortly...
 TROI / Perhaps his reunification talks were successful...
 RIKER / Geordi?
 GEORDI / None of the transponder signatures match up to the missing ship, Commander. They might have been altered... I'll keep checking...
 RIKER / (beat) Set a course to intercept...
 WORF / Sir, the captain's orders were to maintain...
 RIKER / I know the captain's orders, Lieutenant. Engage.
 PICARD / (calling to o.c.) Well done, Mister Data... although I believe you parted Commander Riker's hair on the wrong side.
 DATA / I will be more observant in the future, sir.
 BEVERLY / We've just received a priority one distress call from the colony on Dulisian Four... a massive failure of the environmental support system. They're going to require evacuation.
 RIKER / Worf, other ships in the vicinity of Dulisian Four...
 WORF / (checking) One, sir... a Rutian archaeological vessel...
 BEVERLY / I'm sure it's not equipped to handle something of this scale, Will...
 RIKER / Geordi, anything more on the Vulcan ships... ?
 GEORDI / I've checked every sensor display backwards and forwards... if the Romulans altered them, they didn't leave any fingerprints... I can't tie any of them to the surplus yard.
 WORF / The Vulcan ships have entered Federation space... maintaining low warp, sir...
 RIKER / (beat) Lay in a new course for Dulisian Four...
 WORF / Incoming Message from Romulus... on all subspace channels.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / Doctor, contact Dulisian Four... and confirm that distress call. I have a feeling it may prove to be a false alarm.
 RIKER / How long will it take to intercept those Vulcan ships, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Fourteen minutes, sir...
 DATA / Communication lines have been terminated at the transmitter... I am quite certain the message was sent prior to the interruption...
 PICARD / Well done, Mister Data...
 DATA / I disagree, Commander. After studying the design of this structure, I have determined that our best route of escape would be the underground exit to the east of this wing... I have disconnected certain security scanners to assist us.
 DATA / I am afraid we cannot permit you to warn your guards.
 WORF / Vulcan defense vessels are also responding... the Romulan force is retreating toward the Neutral Zone...
 RIKER / Uh Uh. They're not taking those Vulcan ships home with them...
 WORF / Visual range, Commander...
 RIKER / On screen.
 GEORDI / (reacting off sensors) A Romulan warbird. Decloaking alongside the Vulcan ships.
 RIKER / Red alert...
 RIKER / Advise the warbird to withdraw from Federation space and leave the Vulcan ships where they are...
 WORF / The warbird is powering up its forward disruptor array...
 RIKER / Ready phasers.
 GEORDI / There were over two thousand Romulan troops on those ships.
 TROI / They destroyed their own invasion force.
 RIKER / Rather than let them be taken prisoner. (softly) Stand down red alert. Mister Worf, advise the Klingon ship to signal us as soon as Captain Picard and Data are safely aboard.
 WORF / Aye, sir...
 PICARD / What will you do now... ?
 PICARD / The Federation will welcome that day.
 DATA / Captain, we will need to reach our transport site in fourteen minutes.
 PICARD / (reacts) Ambassador...
 PICARD / I have learned it is useless to argue with you once your mind is set.
 PICARD / (beat) Would you be surprised to learn that he found them equally valuable?
 PICARD / Then, I would offer you the chance to touch what he shared with me...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45233.1. Our terraforming mission to Doraf One has been suddenly cancelled and the Enterprise recalled to Starbase Two-thirty-four. Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear...
 PICARD / I will admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral.
 PICARD / A defection?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45236.4. As I study the intelligence reports on Ambassador Spock's disappearance, I cannot help but feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission, for I know this man through his father. It was barely a year ago that I shared a mind meld with the Vulcan Sarek... now we must meet again as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions.
 RIKER / We'll be coming into orbit of Vulcan in less than an hour, Captain... you may want to get some rest...
 PICARD / Yes, yes, of course, you're right...
 PICARD / We should notify Sarek's wife of our plans...
 RIKER / All taken care of, sir... she'll be transporting aboard at oh-seven hundred...
 PICARD / And Sarek?
 RIKER / She says he is too ill to join her.
 PICARD / (nods) Not unexpected. The man is dying. And I have the... honor... to bring him the news that his son may have betrayed the Federation.
 RIKER / How well do you know Spock?
 PICARD / I met him only once... what I know of him comes from history books and of course the mind meld with his father...
 RIKER / That must cover a lot of ground...
 PICARD / Not as much as you'd imagine... Sarek and Spock...
 PICARD / ... Well, sometimes, fathers and sons...
 RIKER / (from personal experience) Understood.
 PICARD / Oh there was one other thing... take a look at this...
 PICARD / Something that turned up during the intelligence sweep... what do you make of it?
 RIKER / (re: the PADD) Metal fragments, possibly disassembled components, identified as Vulcan... recovered from a downed Ferengi ship...
 PICARD / And the crates they were in were marked as medical supplies.
 RIKER / Contraband?
 PICARD / They've been sent to Vulcan for identification... Starfleet has requested we lend them a hand...
 PICARD / Perrin...
 PICARD / And you. How is Sarek?
 PICARD / Then the disease has progressed...
 PICARD / It must be very hard for you.
 PICARD / I hope that will not be soon.
 PICARD / I admire your strength more than I can tell you.
 PICARD / Perrin... you know why I've come to Vulcan.
 PICARD / I must ask you about Spock.
 PICARD / Is it possible he was abducted?
 PICARD / Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this?
 PICARD / Would it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you and Spock?
 PICARD / I was not aware that Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition...
 PICARD / Would Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left?
 PICARD / (gently) Perrin... would you allow me to see Sarek?
 RIKER / The Vulcans can't figure out what these fragments are... but they've identified the metal as a dentarium alloy.
 GEORDI / That pretty well indicates that they're Vulcan... (beat) And dentarium also means that whatever this was, it was designed for use in space.
 GEORDI / From the look of the damage, must've been a high-speed impact.
 RIKER / (acknowledges) A Ferengi cargo shuttle that went down in the Hanolin asteroid belt... the debris was spread over one hundred square kilometers.
 GEORDI / Could it be a weapons array?
 RIKER / That was my first thought. But the Vulcans don't have any record of stolen weapons. Or stolen parts, for that matter.
 GEORDI / This is gonna be like putting together a big jig-saw puzzle when you don't know what the picture is supposed to be.
 PICARD / Sarek, I have come a long way to see you.
 PICARD / I must speak to you about your son...
 PICARD / About Spock.
 PICARD / Yes. He's missing.
 PICARD / Yes, my friend.
 PICARD / I need your help. I must find Spock.
 PICARD / I know. He is reported on Romulus.
 PICARD / That's what I hope to find out from you.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / Have you any idea what might have taken him to Romulus?
 PICARD / Is there anyone on Romulus that he might know... or choose to contact?
 PICARD / Who is Pardek?
 PICARD / Who is Pardek?
 PICARD / Pardek represented Romulus?
 PICARD / It has been suggested... that Spock may have defected.
 PICARD / But you believe he might be there to see Pardek...
 PICARD / (not worth going into) I've heard of him.
 PICARD / Do you know what business they could have together?
 PICARD / (softly) Sarek, we are a part of each other. I know Spock has caused you pain... but I also know you love him...
 PICARD / Peace and long life, Sarek.
 PICARD / (whispering) ... and prosper.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45240.1. To cross the Neutral Zone, I will require a cloaked ship. To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon Home World. After all we did for Gowron during the recent war, I am certain he will be happy to return a favor.
 PICARD / Still no response from the Klingons, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Nossir.
 PICARD / He's ignoring me... what other explanation is there?
 RIKER / Seems like, after three days of hailing him, he could've found a minute to talk to you...
 WORF / Sir...
 PICARD / (rather snappish) Yes, Lieutenant?
 WORF / I believe I know why our messages are not being answered. Gowron... has been rewriting Klingon history.
 RIKER / Rewriting history?
 WORF / He is claiming that it was his courage... his genius... which brought about an end to the civil war.
 PICARD / I see.
 WORF / In the new version... there is no mention made of the Federation's help in his rise to power.
 RIKER / If Worf's right, our arrival would be an uncomfortable reminder of the facts...
 PICARD / Victors re-write the history books. He can take every bit of credit, I'll gladly grant him that. But I need a ship. (frowns, a beat) If Gowron won't talk to me... get somebody who will, somebody on the High Council, K'Tal perhaps...
 WORF / Yes, Captain.
 DATA / Captain, I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of Romulus...
 DATA / This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which Pardek participated four years ago...
 PICARD / That's all?
 DATA / Yessir.
 PICARD / Run it again.
 PICARD / Call up the intelligence scan of Spock on Romulus...
 PICARD (o.c.) / Same man... Pardek...
 PICARD / One question answered. (beat) What do we know of him?
 DATA / He has been in public service since he was a young man... a senator for nine decades. He is considered a "man of the people... " He has sponsored many reforms. Reportedly, he is considered by the Romulan leadership to be something of a radical because he has been an advocate for peace throughout his career.
 PICARD / (nods) I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him.
 DATA / Yessir.
 PICARD / Where are we likely to find him -- other than on the floor of the Romulan Senate?
 DATA / The district he represents is called the Krocton Segment. He maintains a dwelling there.
 PICARD / Very good, Mister Data.
 DATA / There is more, sir... I took the liberty of expanding the perameters of my search... and have discovered that Pardek has several relatives in the Krocton Segment. It is likely that you will be able to locate him there on the third day of the Romulan week when the Senate is not in session.
 PICARD / Your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me.
 DATA / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / If I ever get to Romulus, Data, I am going to need help. I'd like you to accompany me.
 DATA / To the surface, sir?
 PICARD / Yes...
 DATA / I understand how you can be made to look Romulan, but I believe it will be more difficult to transform an android, Captain.
 PICARD / I think Doctor Crusher can come up with something...
 WORF / Captain... we are being hailed by the Klingon Home World.
 PICARD / Gowron or K'Tal?
 WORF / Neither, sir... it is the junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation.
 RIKER / Junior adjutant.
 PICARD / Name.
 WORF / B'ijik, sir.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Is he aware that we've been transmitting messages for three days?
 PICARD / It is of the utmost importance that I speak with Gowron...
 PICARD / A message. Very well.
 PICARD / Tell Gowron, Leader of the High Council of the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favor.
 PICARD / I require a cloaked vessel.
 PICARD / It is for a mission that could have repercussions throughout the quadrant.
 PICARD / The only benefit to the Klingon Empire... would be our gratitude.
 PICARD / Yes. And please add that if he is unable to provide a ship, I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be willing to help me. And then they would have our gratitude.
 PICARD / Also please tell him that I am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well. It is a tribute to his skilled leadership.
 BEVERLY / They aren't removable, are they, Data?
 DATA / Removable, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Your ears.
 DATA / No, Doctor... they are fully integrated components.
 BEVERLY / (to the supernumerary) We'll need molds of his ears too...
 PICARD / What about his skin color?
 BEVERLY / We'll have to do some tests with his skin pigmentation. Changing it to appear Romulan shouldn't be too hard... I just want to be sure we can change it back again afterwards.
 BEVERLY / The right eye is point-zero-zero- four higher than the left...
 PICARD / (playfully) It is not...
 BEVERLY / You want a proper fit on your prosthetic? Trust your tailor.
 RIKER / (re: the eyes) I won't tell a soul, sir.
 PICARD / Anything from Gowron?
 RIKER / Nosir. But after your tailor is done, would you join me in the cargo bay... La Forge has made some progress on those metal fragments...
 BEVERLY / These two still have to report to Mister Mott to get their hairpieces designed...
 PICARD / Thirty minutes, Number One.
 GEORDI / What we seem to have here is a navigational deflector array. Or at least what's left of one.
 RIKER / Why would anyone want a Vulcan deflector?
 GEORDI / Beats me, Commander. Every question we answer here seems to bring up two more.
 PICARD / You're certain it is Vulcan...
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. A metallurgical analysis confirmed that... and by running a molecular pattern trace, we even identified the ship as the T'Pau. (MORE)
 GEORDI (cont'd) / It was decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at Qualor Two. As far as anyone knows it's still there.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / (taps combadge) Yes, Lieutenant?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow. Compliments of Gowron.
 PICARD / Please convey our gratitude, Mister Worf. Advise the captain that Lieutenant Commander Data and I will be transporting aboard shortly.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / I'd like to take the Enterprise to Qualor Two... see what I can find out there.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 PICARD / That's right.
 PICARD / I'm sorry. It is a confidential matter.
 PICARD / (impassive) Defector...
 PICARD / Your orders are to take us to a set of coordinates near Romulus... and to bring us back. That is all I am prepared to discuss.
 PICARD / I realize that.
 PICARD / Quite nice. Thank you.
 DATA / Is this the captain's quarters, or mine?
 PICARD / Of course. This will be fine.
 PICARD / Good. I prefer it that way.
 PICARD / I haven't had gagh in a while... been looking forward to it. Very fresh.
 PICARD / Yes. I do.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's log, stardate 45240.6. The Enterprise is nearing Qualor Two -- home of a Federation surplus depot operated by the Zakdorn. We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the Ferengi.
 WORF / I have made contact, Commander.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / I'm Commander William Riker of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 RIKER / We need some information about a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. It was sent there a few years ago.
 RIKER / Appointment... no...
 RIKER / Who does he think he is?
 TROI / The quartermaster of the surplus yard, Commander. With information you need.
 RIKER / Right. Mister Worf... reestablish communication.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Mister Dokaychin...
 RIKER / Mister Dokahchin, the information I need involves a matter of major importance to the Federation.
 RIKER / I'll need access to your logs, your files... (beat - no answer) It won't take long. My people can do the work.
 RIKER / Fine. One of your people, then.
 RIKER / Well, sir... what would you suggest?
 RIKER / (incredulous) I don't believe him.
 TROI / He's king of his particular hill, Commander. You'll have to treat him that way.
 RIKER / Counselor... a perfect job for you.
 RIKER / Thank you for coming on board, Mister Dokachin.
 RIKER / We've tied into your computers. If you could access the files...
 TROI / Mister Dokachin, we must find this ship -- and you're the only one who can help us.
 TROI / Deanna Troi, Ship's Counselor.
 GEORDI / Where is the ship now?
 RIKER / I'd appreciate that.
 TROI / Are you serious?
 WORF / Commander, we are approaching the designated coordinates.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / The T'Pau is missing?
 RIKER / How could a ship disappear from your depot?
 GEORDI / When it was brought here... was it stripped of materiel -- armament, sensors... ?
 GEORDI / Can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector?
 RIKER / It's not there anymore. What's left of that deflector is laid out on the floor of our cargo bay.
 RIKER / Maybe we ought to pay a visit to the Tripoli...
 WORF / Approaching the coordinates of the Tripoli, sir.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / When is today's transport?
 RIKER / Ensign, align the Enterprise so we'll appear to be one of the abandoned ships. Mister La Forge, when we're in position, shut down engines and all systems except sensors and life support.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / I'm guessing somebody's going to be here to receive those storage tanks -- and I'd be very interested to see who it is.
 DATA / These quarters were obviously intended for only one crewmember, sir. There is a single sleeping space.
 PICARD / I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us together in here.
 DATA / Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the -- (not sure what to call the hole in the wall) -- shelf. I will be content to stand.
 PICARD / Very well, Mister Data. Thank you.
 DATA / Are you comfortable, sir?
 PICARD / I suppose so.
 DATA / Good-night, Captain. Sleep well.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 PICARD / What are you doing?
 DATA / Sir? Was I making noise?
 PICARD / Not exactly...
 DATA / I was processing the information we have accumulated on Romulan society. I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan.
 PICARD / I see.
 DATA / Would you like me to discontinue?
 PICARD / No, no. Please go ahead.
 PICARD / What are you looking at?
 DATA / I am not looking at anything, sir. I am continuing to organize my files.
 PICARD / But you're looking at me.
 DATA / I am sorry if I am disturbing you, sir. I will not look in your direction.
 DATA / Sir, do you not wish to sleep?
 PICARD / I don't think so. Shall we continue to go over the files?
 DATA / I would be happy to. (launching in without further ado) I have been studying the Krocton Segment, as you asked, and have selected an appropriate site for our transport...
 PICARD / Thank you, Captain.
 PICARD / Sarek is dead.
 WORF / Commander... sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed.
 RIKER / Identification?
 WORF / Negative. No transponder signal... no subspace marker...
 GEORDI / Sounds like they don't want to be identified.
 WORF / The ship is coming out of warp now...
 RIKER / On screen.
 GEORDI / Sensors indicate a combat vessel... origin undetermined... heavily armed... mass and density suggest it's fully loaded with cargo. From the look of these internal scans, I'd guess a good part of that cargo is weaponry.
 WORF / The ship is moving into section twelve delta four...
 GEORDI / Commander... readings indicate the surface-to-ship transport has begun...
 RIKER / Bring the engines back on line, Mister La Forge... And restore all systems to normal.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 WORF / He's powering up engines, sir -- turning starboard.
 RIKER / Open a channel.
 WORF / Open, sir.
 RIKER / This is Commander William Riker of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Identify yourself.
 RIKER / I repeat... you have entered a Federation depot... identify yourself.
 WORF / Sir, the ship is locking phasers...
 RIKER / Shields up. Red alert.
 GEORDI / That ship easily matches our armament, Commander.
 WORF / It's coming about...
 RIKER / If you do not respond to our hails, we will take that as evidence of hostile action.
 WORF / There is an energy build-up in their phaser banks... sir, they are activating weapons!
 WORF / Forward shields down to seventy-two percent --
 RIKER / Boost power to the shields...
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, target their weapon systems only and prepare to fire--
 WORF / Forward shields at sixty-eight percent, aft shields forty percent...
 RIKER / On my mark, a point-seven-five burst only. We just want to get their attention.
 WORF / Ready, sir.
 RIKER / Fire.
 WORF / Their forward shields are damaged, sir...
 GEORDI / We destroyed one of their phaser arrays... looks like collateral damage in the cargo area... (beat, reacting to sensor readings) Sir, I'm picking up massive power fluctuations... internal explosions... with all the armament that ship is carrying -- it's gonna blow!
 PICARD (o.c.) / Well, Mister Data...
 PICARD (o.c.) / (continuing) ... what do you think?
 DATA / I am very pleased, sir. I would not have thought it possible.
 DATA / I am eager to test the success of our efforts. It does remain to be seen if the Romulans will accept us.
 DATA / Sir, you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador Sarek's death.
 PICARD / Sarek and I shared a particular bond. Our lives touched in an unusual way... I admit that I feel the effects of his loss.
 PICARD / (continuing) The tenor of our mission has changed, at least for me, Data. We were sent to confront Spock about his disappearance. Now, we must also tell him his father is dead.
 DATA / I am afraid I do not entirely understand, sir. As a Vulcan, would not Ambassador Spock simply see death as a logical result of his father's illness... ?
 PICARD / It is never quite that simple. Not even for a Vulcan. Certainly not for Spock who is also half Human. (beat) They spent a lifetime in conflict... now the chance to resolve all of their differences is gone.
 DATA / (processing this) Considering the exceptionally long lifespan of Vulcans, it does seem odd that Spock and Sarek did not choose to resolve their differences in the time available.
 PICARD / (acknowledges) Yes. It really is quite... illogical... (beat) A father and son... both proud, both stubborn... more alike than either would care to admit. They've spent a lifetime building emotional barriers. Those aren't easy to break down.
 PICARD / And then the time comes when it is too late to try. One realizes that all the things he had planned to say will go unsaid. (beat) That is a difficult moment... and a lonely one. Spock will now have to face that moment.
 PICARD / I have a good idea. (beat) We are ready to be transported to the surface.
 DATA / This is definitely the street on which the intelligence scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir... adjusting for the optical distortion, I am able to verify the architectural features...
 PICARD / Where were they standing?
 PICARD / Data...
 DATA / Sir?
 PICARD / You're moving about in a very... well, android manner...
 DATA / I am sorry, Captain. I will be more careful.
 PICARD / And don't call me "Captain."
 DATA / Yes, Cap -- (cutting himself off) I understand. (looks around) I have located the place where they were standing...
 PICARD / Where?
 DATA / It is here -- (gestures) -- at this doorway.
 DATA / A legal intercessor's office... the name is similar to Pardek's. It would appear to be one of his relatives.
 PICARD / Not open for business yet...
 DATA / Nevertheless, it would be my recommendation that we keep this location under observation. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / I have clearly determined Pardek's routine. On days when the Senate is not in session, he invariably comes to this section after the median hour.
 PICARD / Very well, why don't we take the opportunity to try some of the local cuisine...
 DATA / What do you recommend?
 DATA / That sounds very appealing. I will have soup.
 PICARD / Soup is fine.
 PICARD / (friendly) Do you happen to know what time the intercessor's office across the way opens?
 PICARD / (reacts) I need his services... he was recommended.
 DATA / We are here for the day... from the city of Rateg.
 DATA / Why do you say that?
 DATA / It is a misconception that all Rategs speak with a particular inflection. In fact, there are twelve different --
 PICARD / (interrupting) We come from several kilometers outside the city...
 PICARD / Madam, you are mistaken.
 PICARD / We can't stay here long.
 DATA / We may not have to... Direct your view to the far corner... is that not Pardek?
 PICARD / I believe you're right...
 DATA / (quietly) Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup.
 PICARD / What? You've made a mistake...
 PICARD / For what? Why have you brought us here?
 PICARD / I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I am looking for Ambassador Spock.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45333.3. The Enterprise is on its way to Penthara Four where a type C asteroid has struck an unpopulated continent.
 NUMEROUS ENGINEERING CREW are busily working with GEORDI and DATA. / 
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) The resulting dust cloud could very well create a phenomenon not unlike the nuclear winters of twenty-first-century Earth. Commander La Forge has begun work on a plan that would counteract the devastation.
 GEORDI / I'm afraid the numbers coming in are already indicating climatic changes, sir.
 RIKER / What kind of drop can we expect?
 DATA / If the Pentharan spheral forecasts are correct, ten to twelve degrees Celsius within the first ten days.
 GEORDI / If it continues like that, their entire ecosystem will be shot to hell.
 RIKER / And I doubt they're prepared to cope with the kind of cold that's coming.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker.
 RIKER / (keys combadge) Yes, Captain.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Would you join me on the bridge, please.
 RIKER / On my way. (to guys) Let me know if those forecast numbers change.
 PICARD, WORF, AN ENSIGN at theconn, and SUPERNUMERARIES / at various stations.
 PICARD / Are you certain, Worf?
 WORF / There was a space_time distortion, sir. And there is something back there. We passed within three hundred kilometers of it.
 PICARD / A bit close for coincidence. (to com) Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Would a delay of an hour affect your plans?
 GEORDI / Not unless another asteroid decides to pay a call on Penthara, sir.
 DATA / The odds of that occurring, Captain, are extremely unlikely, given the time frame.
 PICARD / Thank you, Mister Data. (to Ensign) Prepare to come about, Ensign. Let's take a look at Mister Worf's distortion.
 RIKER / Mister Worf's what?
 PICARD / The Lieutenant's sensors detected a temporal distortion, Number One, almost directly on our current course. There seems to be a small object back there that wasn't there a few moments ago.
 WORF / The object is fifty kilometers ahead, sir.
 PICARD / Full stop, Ensign.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / Dimensions, Worf?
 WORF / Approximately five meters in length, sir.
 PICARD / Lifesigns?
 WORF / No signs of any kind, sir. Sensors are not penetrating its hull.
 PICARD / Try hailing it.
 WORF / (pushes a series of buttons) That's odd.
 RIKER / What's odd?
 WORF / We've received a response, sir, but...
 PICARD / (get on with it) Yes, Mister Worf?
 WORF / They want you to... "Move over," sir.
 PICARD / (looks at Riker and then back at Worf) Reply that the Enterprise isn't going anywhere, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Not the Enterprise, Captain. You.
 PICARD / What are you trying to...
 PICARD / Who are you?
 PICARD / Really?
 PICARD / And where exactly is it you come from?
 PICARD / Exactly what kind of historian are you?
 PICARD / You can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room is of interest to future historians...
 PICARD / You flatter me Professor, but I can't help but wonder what could possibly have caused you to select me as the subject of your study. Even in this decade, there are far wiser and more experienced Humans both in and out of Starfleet.
 WORF / Why now?
 GEORDI / Right. If you came back to study us, to study the captain, why did you pick today? Why not a year ago... or a year from now?
 WORF / Usually. Why?
 RIKER / Tell me, Professor, at what point does time travel become a tool for historians?
 BEVERLY / Telurian plague!
 BEVERLY / Telurian plague... was it cured? I mean, has it been cured by your century? There can't be any harm in asking that.
 PICARD / I realize it will be difficult, but we must all keep our questions regarding the future to ourselves. Professor...
 GEORDI / (sarcastic) If I hand my assignment in on time, do I get a little glimpse into next week's poker game?
 PICARD / Mister Data, please show the Professor to his quarters.
 DATA / (standing) This way, sir.
 RIKER / What did he mean he picked the right day?
 PICARD / You know everything I do, Will.
 RIKER / Deanna?
 TROI / It's hard to tell. But he is holding something back.
 BEVERLY / (to Troi) Of course he is. Think of all the things he could tell us... all the things he'd like to tell us...
 TROI / (shaking her head) That might be it, I don't know.
 RIKER / How can we be sure he's not an imposter? God knows we've run into enough of them.
 PICARD / He is Human. Our medical scans have proved that. Haven't they, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / He's Human, alright.
 PICARD / And there was a temporal distortion back there, correct Mister Worf?
 WORF / (begrudgingly) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / And no one can deny that ship of his is unlike anything we've ever seen before.
 GEORDI / The hull is composed of some kind of plasticized tritanium mesh. Nothing we have on record... at least not 'til the present.
 PICARD / I appreciate your caution, Mister Worf. I share it. Have his vessel brought into a shuttlebay. Place it under guard.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / I realize this isn't going to be an easy visit for some of you. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Nevertheless, I've reviewed the Professor's credentials, and they're in order. So, I'd like you all to extend him every courtesy.
 WORF / (put upon) Including questionnaires?
 PICARD / Including questionnaires. Dismissed.
 DATA / If you're referring to the first production model automobile of the twentieth century, perhaps the subsequent Model A might be a more apt analogy since I am Noonian Soong's revised prototype.
 DATA / Is there a problem, sir?
 DATA / (almost shy) Would I be correct, Professor, in assuming that you know whether or not I am still... alive in the twenty-sixth century?
 DATA / (continuing his line of questioning) Since you seemed to know so much about Captain Picard and the ship... I assumed that you would...
 DATA / Yes, sir. I am sorry, sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45334.5. We have arrived at Penthara Four...
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) ... and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastation caused by the asteroid impact.
 PICARD / We've located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide... here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas to form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat from the sun.
 GEORDI / Less than twenty percent of your normal sunlight is getting through that dust, Doctor. If we can hold enough heat in with the CO2, it should give the planet time to mend itself.
 RIKER / (quietly) Look who's here.
 WORF / I hate questionnaires.
 BEVERLY / (with enthusiasm, she's quite taken with Rasmussen) Professor, please come join us.
 BEVERLY / Not at all. You're probably the topic of conversation at every table in the room.
 WORF / (peeved) Tomorrow!
 RIKER / No problem, Professor.
 RIKER / (puzzled) Do we have reason not to be?
 WORF / Are you suggesting an important event is imminent?
 RIKER / (after a long beat) How come there's no record of other future historians traveling back to witness "important events?"
 BEVERLY / (fascinated) They hadn't even perfected quarantine fields by then. You must have seen surgical masks and gloves.
 RIKER / Mind if I ask what that is?
 RIKER / (getting a bit frustrated) Is something supposed to be happening here?
 RIKER / (pauses) I suppose the warp coil. Before we had warp drive, Humans were confined to a single sector of the galaxy.
 RIKER / What's going on? You waiting for someone?
 WORF / (abruptly) Phasers!
 RIKER / Where?!
 WORF / There were no phasers in the 22nd century.
 GEORDI / As soon as we input this atmospheric data from Moseley, the computer should tell us how many holes we'll have to punch.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Ah, Data. Good.
 DATA / What have you learned about the tectonic stability around the drilling sites?
 GEORDI / Couldn't be better. Our scans were all clear and Moseley says there hasn't been so much as a quiver in over a century.
 GEORDI / We're kind of busy here, Professor. Tomorrow might be better. (to Data, as he points to a monitor) We've got about twenty-three thousand thermal simulations. You think you could check them through for anomalies?
 DATA / Certainly.
 GEORDI / Not fast enough for you, Professor?
 DATA / (finishing his task) Two hundred nine anomalies all within acceptable parameters.
 GEORDI / Thanks, Data. (to Rasmussen) You've come to witness this mission... that's it, isn't it?
 DATA / (to Rasmussen, re: the chip) I will return the answered questions to you as soon as possible, sir.
 GEORDI / If you'll excuse me.
 GEORDI / A VISOR.
 GEORDI / ("when's this guy gonna shut up?") It allows me to see... I like it fine.
 GEORDI / (walking into engineering) A fly on the wall, eh?
 DATA / The computer has configured the drilling pattern and specified depths.
 GEORDI / (taps insignia) Captain, we've got what we need. I'm ready to transport to the surface.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We'll notify Doctor Moseley. Good luck, Geordi.
 GEORDI / (To Data and Rasmussen) Gentlemen.
 DATA / (puzzled) I know of no one who said that, Professor.
 GEORDI / The Enterprise will monitor the CO2 concentrations at six different altitudes. If all goes well, it won't take more than twenty bore sites.
 GEORDI / (hits his com button) La Forge to Commander Riker. How are you doing?
 RIKER / We're ready when you are, Geordi.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / All we need's an open channel with Data.
 RIKER / Open the channel, Mister Worf, and prepare to fire at target one.
 WORF / The computer has locked in phaser depth calculations.
 RIKER / Mister Data?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Ready, sir.
 RIKER / Fire.
 DATA / Target one is emitting two thousand cubic meters per second. Target two, one thousand six hundred.
 GEORDI / You picking up anything at altitude, Data?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / CO2 concentrations remain unchanged at upper elevations.
 WORF / Target fourteen complete, sir.
 RIKER / Data?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / No change, Commander.
 RIKER / Winds, Geordi?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Holding steady, sir.
 WORF / The computer has stopped the drilling.
 RIKER / You should be getting something, Data.
 DATA / (pleased) Elevated CO2 levels at twenty kilometers.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Now you're talking. And we've got some new temperatures coming in.
 GEORDI / (equally excited) Correction, Doctor. Two equatorial stations are showing slight increases.
 PICARD / Glad we could help, Doctor. The Enterprise will remain in orbit and continue to monitor your progress. Picard out.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, return to a synchronous orbit.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 TROI / He's after more than a history lesson. I can tell you that.
 BEVERLY / What is it? What are you getting from him?
 TROI / I don't know. But it's like he's trying to confuse us... misdirect us somehow.
 BEVERLY / Professor. Is everything alright? Are you well?
 TROI / I've got some things to take care of.
 BEVERLY / I don't see why not. (she finishes her treatment) Give me a minute.
 TROI / I don't dislike you, Professor.
 TROI / Should I?
 TROI / Picard's empath?
 TROI / Why would you care whether I trust you or not?
 TROI / You're right... I don't trust you.
 TROI / (returning the smile) I'm sure you did.
 BEVERLY / (handing the neural simulator to Rasmussen) Well, it's nice to see you two are finally getting along.
 TROI / (holding back her sarcasm) I really must be going.
 BEVERLY / Why don't you try a Berylite scan? I'd be interested to see where his micro-levels are.
 BEVERLY / So... what else can I show you?
 BEVERLY / (smiling) Curiosity is why most of us are out here, professor.
 BEVERLY / More vibrant. That's nice, I like that.
 BEVERLY / You're not supposed to be influencing the past, remember? And I'm beginning to feel a little... influenced. Anyway, I'm old enough to be your great, great, great, great, grandmother!
 PICARD / What kind of questions did he have for you, Number One?
 RIKER / All he wanted to know about was previous starships. What I thought was innovative on the last Enterprise or the one before that. He said he wanted to see how well we "grasped the fundamentals."
 DATA / His queries to me primarily focused on Doctor Soong's...
 WORF / Captain, I am detecting a massive earthquake on the surface.
 WORF / (continuing) Two earthquakes, sir.
 PICARD / Location?
 DATA / Both epicenters are beneath the two southernmost drill sites, Captain.
 PICARD / Is La Forge still down there?
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Find him.
 RIKER / We've also got some volcanic activity... pretty severe.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here, Captain. Moseley and I are on our way back to his lab.
 PICARD / Are you alright?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We're okay, but those were pretty big, sir. If this was Earth, I'd say around an eight or an eight five on the Richter Scale. We're starting to see some volcanic plumes, Captain.
 WORF / Two more eruptions, sir.
 DATA / It is most likely that we overestimated the geologic stability around the CO2 pockets.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We're in the lab, sir.
 PICARD / (to Moseley) What about the dust?
 GEORDI / The ash the volcanos are throwing into the atmosphere is going to compound the existing problem. In a matter of days, there'll be no sunlight getting through those clouds.
 RIKER / Captain, look at this.
 RIKER / (continuing) These are the coordinates of the eruptions, and these...
 RIKER / (continuing) ... are the phaser drilling sites.
 PICARD / The mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released.
 GEORDI / Captain, Doctor Moseley and I have a couple of ideas, but they're going to take some time to sort out.
 PICARD / Sort them out, Commander.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (looking at the screen) We came here to help these people.
 PICARD / And look what we've done.
 DATA / (shouting) Music, Professor.
 DATA / (shouting) Yes, sir. Mozart's "Jupiter symphony in G minor"; Bach's "Third Brandenberg Concerto"; Beethoven's "Symphony Number Nine, Second Movement 'Molto Vivace'"; and "La Donna e Mobile", from Verdi's "Rigoletto".
 DATA / Computer, eliminate Program One.
 DATA / Computer, eliminate Program Two.
 DATA / Computer, eliminate Program Three.
 DATA / Computer, half volume.
 DATA / Actually, I am capable of distinguishing over one hundred fifty simultaneous compositions. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / But in order to analyze the aesthetics, I try to limit myself to ten or less.
 DATA / I am assisting Commander La Forge in the analysis of an extremely complex calculation. It demands a great deal of my concentration.
 DATA / You did ask me to be thorough.
 DATA / Certainly, as soon as my work here is completed.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Commander Data.
 DATA / Yes, Worf.
 WORF / Commander La Forge is hailing you from the surface, sir.
 DATA / Patch it through, please.
 GEORDI / Have you rerun the phase reversal figures, Data?
 DATA / There were no errors, Geordi. The variance must be no more than point zero six terawatts.
 GEORDI / I don't see any other choice. We'll keep running the numbers down here. You better inform the captain... of the good news and the bad news. La Forge out.
 PICARD / The good news.
 DATA / The motion of the dust has created a great deal of electrostatic energy in the upper atmosphere. With a modified phaser blast, we could create a shock-front that would encircle the planet and ionize the particles.
 PICARD / That would be like striking a spark in a room filled with gas.
 DATA / With one exception, sir. The particles would be converted into a high-energy plasma which our shields could absorb and redirect harmlessly into space.
 PICARD / Turn the Enterprise into a lightning rod.
 DATA / Precisely, sir.
 PICARD / And what about the bad news, Data?
 DATA / If our phaser discharge is off by as little as point-zero-six terawatts, it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion.
 PICARD / Meaning?
 DATA / We would completely burn off the planet's atmosphere.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. While Doctor Moseley takes La Forge's plan to the leaders of the colony, I find myself weighing the potential consequences of a more philosophical issue.
 PICARD / (not turning) Come.
 PICARD / I would imagine you know why I've asked you here.
 PICARD / I'm faced with a dilemma. There's a planet beneath us that is slowly turning to ice. If we don't do something about it, I'm told that within weeks, thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, will die.
 PICARD / (turning to Rasmussen) Yes, it would. It would be quite a shame.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge has a possible solution. The margin of error is extremely critical, but if it's successful, there's no more threat.
 PICARD / Every living thing on the planet will perish.
 PICARD / (speaking hypothetically -- he's not asking) Not if you were to help me.
 PICARD / No, I'm not. Everything Starfleet stands for, everything I've ever believed in, tells me I can't ask you that. (pause) But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, and you know what happened to them... what will happen to them.
 PICARD / I have never been afraid to reevaluate my convictions, Professor. Right now, I have twenty million reasons to do so.
 PICARD / Your presence potentially gives me access to a kind of information that was never available to me before. An additional tool, a new weapon in my armory... you, Professor. If I'm going to reexamine my beliefs, I must take advantage of every possible asset. It would be irresponsible of me not to have you here.
 PICARD / How can you be? How can you be "comfortable" watching people die?
 PICARD / (interrupting) I know, Professor, "What if one of those lives I save down there is a child who grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or Khan Singh?" (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / First year philosophy students have been asked that question ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered. But this is not a class in temporal logic... It's not hypothetical, it's real. Can't you see that?
 PICARD / I have two choices. Either way, one version or another of history will wend its way forward. The history you know or another one. Who's to say which is better? All I know here, today, is that one way, millions of lives could be saved. Isn't that incentive enough?
 PICARD / We have a Prime Directive, Professor, which tells us we have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alien worlds. (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / But even though I am sworn to uphold it, I have disregarded that directive on more than one occasion... When I knew it was the right thing to do. If you are holding true to some "temporal" equivalent of that directive, isn't there a possibility that this is an occasion for you to make an exception, to help me choose... because it's the right thing to do?
 PICARD / Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do I ask Marie or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday on Tahiti or on Risa? A man's life, his future, hinges on each of a thousand choices. Living is making choices. (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / Now you ask me to believe that if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books, it could irreparably alter your past! Well, perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, Professor Rasmussen. Because your past is my future and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, the electrostatic conditions are about as good as they're going to get. If we're going to try this, now's the time.
 PICARD / (to Riker) How long will it take them to program the phasers, Number One?
 RIKER / (seeing Picard means business) We just need to tie in Geordi's atmospheric sensors.
 PICARD / Quite the contrary, Professor. You've been quite helpful.
 PICARD / By your refusing to assist me, I'm left with the same choice I began with; to try or not to try... to run the risk or to play it safe. But your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose can be... that right or wrong, the choice is mine. And since I've never been much for playing it safe... I choose to try.
 PICARD / Program the firing sequence, Mister Data.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45335.0. Doctor Moseley has met with the colony leaders, who all agree they are willing to take the risk.
 WORF / (to Geordi on viewscreen) Warp power is being rerouted to the main deflector dish, Commander.
 GEORDI / Keep the phasers on active surge control, Worf. We're only going to have one shot at this.
 RIKER / (ignoring Rasmussen) You have the sequence locked in, Data?
 DATA / Yes, sir. After an eight point three second burst from the dish, we will discharge all EPS taps through the phasers.
 PICARD / Geordi, it's time you return to the ship. (to com) Mister O'Brien, prepare to transport...
 GEORDI / Excuse me, sir, but I can be a lot more help down here. We've got to compensate for the density variations right up to the last second.
 DATA / Doctor Moseley's computers can accomplish the same task, sir. But Commander La Forge would be better able to anticipate unexpected variances.
 PICARD / (looking at the screen) Geordi, you know better than anyone that there's no guarantee this is going to work. And if it fails...
 GEORDI / There's no guarantee it's going to fail, Captain. I'd like your permission to remain on the surface.
 PICARD / Permission granted.
 PICARD / Good luck, Commander.
 GEORDI / Thank you, sir.
 DATA / The deflector dish has been reconfigured, Captain.
 RIKER / Proceed, Mister Data.
 DATA / Stand by for auto-phaser interlock. Activating deflector beam.
 WORF / EPS taps are on-line. (a beat) Phasers firing.
 DATA / Activating shield invertors... now!
 PICARD / (tentatively) Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / La Forge here. Still breathing, Captain.
 GEORDI / You see, sir, I told you there was nothing to worry about.
 PICARD / Report back to the ship when you're ready, Commander. (to Moseley) Doctor, we'll stay in orbit to analyze the remaining volcanic disturbances. (smiling) I think the best advice might be to let them cool down on their own.
 PICARD / I'm afraid we're going to have to take a look in your vessel, Professor.
 PICARD / A number of objects have turned up missing in the last few days. If they are in your possession, I would like them returned.
 WORF / If you will not open the vessel, I will... with explosives, if necessary.
 RIKER / If we don't get in that thing, I guarantee you won't either.
 RIKER / Why Data?
 PICARD / (understanding) Because if I order Data never to divulge what he sees in there, he won't. (to Data) With the exception of anything that might belong to us.
 DATA / Understood, sir.
 DATA / I do not believe any of these items belong to you, Professor.
 DATA / Do you plan to put these objects into a museum?
 DATA / But this vessel... ? And the temporal distortion that coincided with your arrival?
 DATA / You are not an historian?
 DATA / What are your intentions, now?
 DATA / I assume your hand print will open the door whether you are conscious or not.
 DATA / (to Picard, handing him the phaser) You were correct to suspect him, sir. But he is from the past, not the future.
 PICARD / (mimicking Rasmussen in Act Four) Trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it already has, Professor?
 PICARD / (still mimicking) Now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that?
 DATA / (to Riker) I believe you will find all the missing items in the vessel, sir.
 BEVERLY / (ice) A very nice performance.
 DATA / He claims to be a twenty-second century inventor, sir.
 PICARD / (it's all coming into focus) Well, it's too bad you weren't a bit more inventive. If fewer things had disappeared, we might not have suspected you. As it was, our only stumbling block was your vessel. Our sensors couldn't penetrate it.
 PICARD / (continuing) But as soon as the door opened, our computer was able to detect and deactivate everything you'd stolen... (holding up the phaser) ... including this.
 RIKER / Take him to a detention cell, Mister Worf. And notify Starfleet that we'll be dropping him off at Starbase Two-one-four.
 PICARD / I'm sure there are more than a few legitimate historians at Starfleet who will be quite eager to meet a Human from your era.
 PICARD / (continuing) Oh, and Professor...
 PICARD / (continuing) Welcome to the twenty-fourth century.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45376.3. We are approaching the planet Bilana Three, where a new method of propulsion known as the Soliton Wave is being developed. The Enterprise has been asked to participate in one of the first tests of this new technology.
 GEORDI is working at a monitor in his office. He / crosses to the pool table, where WORF and DATA are working. Geordi is very up, very excited. Data and Worf are their usual stoic selves.
 GEORDI / (to Data) We're going to witness a moment in history, Data.
 DATA / (puzzled) Every nanosecond in this continuum becomes a moment in history once it has elapsed.
 GEORDI / No, no. I mean we're going to see something that people will talk about for years.
 GEORDI / (to Worf) Think about it... no more bulky warp engines or nacelles... a ship just generates a Soliton Wave... and then rides it through space like a surfboard.
 GEORDI / This is going to be like being there to watch Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier, or Zephram Cochrane engage the first warp drive!
 DATA / It should be interesting.
 WORF / (flat) Very exciting.
 GEORDI / I'm talking to the wrong crowd. (sees another crewman and walks away) Donaldson! Hey, Donaldson, can you believe that we're actually going to be there when they...
 WORF / (to com) Transfer the signal to this station.
 WORF / Mother?
 WORF / Is father with you?
 WORF / Very well. I will make arrangements for you to come aboard.
 WORF / (warm) Hello, Alexander.
 WORF / It is good to see you both. How long can you stay?
 WORF / Mother, why does Alexander believe he is remaining... ?
 WORF / Mother...
 WORF / (gentle but firm) Mother. We need to talk about Alexander.
 WORF / I don't recall you smiling when I knocked over that lamp.
 WORF / (protesting) Mother, you both still have many years---
 WORF / That is not possible. We will have to find another option.
 WORF / Difficulties?
 WORF / Klingon children are often... difficult to control...
 WORF / (shocked) My son is... a liar?
 WORF / Did you enjoy going to school on Earth?
 WORF / Did you like your teachers?
 WORF / Good.
 WORF / I understand that you lived in my old room.
 WORF / Good.
 WORF / (prompting) Alexander...
 WORF / (firmer) The teacher asked you a question.
 WORF / Yes... of course.
 WORF / It has... not been decided.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / I thought our meeting was at eleven hundred hours, Mister Worf.
 WORF / I apologize for being late, Captain. I was detained in... school. (off Picard's look) I was enrolling my... son in class.
 PICARD / I see. (beat, then back to business) Several officers will be transferring aboard next week and I'd like to discuss making a few personnel changes---
 WORF / (to Com) Worf here.
 WORF / (curt) This is not a good time. I will contact you shortly, Ms. Kyle. Worf out. (beat) Sorry, Captain.
 PICARD / Personnel changes. I'd like you to consider transferring Ensign Rocha to phaser control and promoting Lieutenant---
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Sickbay to Worf.
 WORF / (to com) Yes, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I need to schedule a physical examination for Alexander. I also need his complete medical records from Earth and---
 WORF / Doctor, I would rather discuss this at a later time.
 PICARD / (holds up a hand) Mister Worf. (gently, with a hint of humor) You are not the first officer on this ship to have a new family member. Take care of your son. The personnel changes can wait.
 WORF / (stands) Thank you, sir.
 PICARD, RIKER, Geordi, Data, and Worf are listening / to DOCTOR JA'DAR. Dr. Ja'Dar is a middle-aged, humanoid alien who appears totally consumed by his work. Ja'Dar is pointing to the wall monitor upon which is a diagram of a SPACECRAFT in orbit around a PLANET.
 PICARD / (impressed) Warp without warp drive...
 RIKER / (with humor) They're going to put you out of a job, Geordi.
 GEORDI / (grins) I hope so, sir.
 DATA / (to Ja'Dar) Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will the Enterprise need to follow the test vehicle?
 PICARD / How will you end the experiment?
 PICARD / Very well, Doctor. We'll contact you again once we've finished studying the mission specs.
 TROI / Worf... I was just talking with Ms. Kyle from the primary school. She told me that you enrolled Alexander in her class this morning.
 WORF / Yes.
 TROI / I'm sure he'll do well. She's a wonderful teacher.
 WORF / Good.
 TROI / Did she tell you about the father_son field trip this afternoon?
 WORF / Yes. We cannot attend.
 TROI / Why not?
 WORF / I have a personnel review scheduled at thirteen hundred hours.
 TROI / It might be a good opportunity to meet some of the other students and parents.
 WORF / I might be able to... reschedule the review.
 TROI / (smiles) Good. I'll let them know you're coming.
 WORF / (defensive) Are you accusing him of stealing?
 WORF / Alexander, did you take the model of the lizard from the table?
 WORF (V. O) / Lieutenant Worf, personal log, stardate 45376.8. Alexander has acted shamefully and as his father, I must now deal with him. (beat) But I find that I would gladly fight ten armed Balduk warriors... rather than face one small child.
 WORF / A Klingon's honor is more important to him than his life. A Klingon would gladly face the most horrible punishment rather than bring shame or disgrace to his family name. His word is his bond... without it, he is nothing.
 WORF / Do you understand?
 WORF / Why did you lie to me?
 WORF / Did you fear the punishment you would receive?
 WORF / (voice rising) You do not know why you lied, and yet you did. You do not know why you stole, and yet you did!
 WORF / (calm) Alexander, come here.
 WORF / When I was a child... younger than you... I lost my parents, my family... my people. Everything I had was taken from me... except my sense of honor. It was the one thing I had which was truly Klingon... and which no one could take away.
 WORF / (re: statue) Do you know who they are?
 WORF / And his brother, Morath. They fought for twelve days and twelve nights... because Morath had broken his word... and brought shame to his family. (quiet) When you lie or steal, you dishonor not only yourself, but your family. (beat) You dishonor me.
 WORF / I accept your word. We will not speak of this matter again.
 TROI (o.c.) / Worf.
 WORF / Counselor?
 TROI / (pleasant) I just wanted to know how the field-trip went yesterday.
 WORF / You have not heard?
 TROI / (concerned) No. Why?
 WORF / Bridge.
 WORF / There was an... incident. Alexander stole a small model and then... told a falsehood. But I have remedied the situation.
 TROI / May I ask how?
 WORF / (proudly) I pointed out his error... told him about Kahless and Morath... and explained the value of honor. The boy understood.
 TROI / I see. (beat) Sometimes these things aren't over as quickly as they seem to be. I'd be happy to help if you have any further problems.
 WORF / Thank you, but that won't be necessary. Alexander will not repeat this mistake.
 DATA / (reading console) The prototype has been towed into position, Captain.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Initiate a radio link to the ship.
 GEORDI / (works console) Link established... receiving prelaunch telemetry now.
 WORF / (to Picard) Incoming message from Doctor Ja'Dar.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Mister Riker?
 RIKER / All science labs standing by.
 PICARD / (to Ja'Dar) The Enterprise is ready, Doctor.
 PICARD / Doctor...
 PICARD / (smiles) Good luck.
 DATA / Sensors show the field generators on the planet surface are charging, sir.
 GEORDI / The soliton wave has been initiated... it's heading for the test ship.
 DATA / The test ship has successfully entered warp, sir.
 PICARD / (to Felton) Engage, Ensign.
 PICARD / Bring us to twenty kilometers from the test ship, Ensign.
 GEORDI / Telemetry looks good... the soliton wave is steady...
 DATA / The test ship is maintaining warp two point three five.
 GEORDI / That's a little faster than they anticipated, but it's still well within the mission parameters.
 PICARD / (to Data) Is the wave having any effect on our own warp drive?
 DATA / No, sir. The effect is localized to within two kilometers of the wavefront.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Mister La Forge, what is the power efficiency of the wave?
 GEORDI / Energy transfer is... ninety-eight percent!
 RIKER / (surprised) Ninety-eight?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. There's less than a two percent energy loss between the wave and the ship.
 DATA / That is four hundred fifty percent more efficient than our own warp drive.
 PICARD / Astonishing. (beat, then to Riker) Have science lab three begin a series of gamma emissions --
 DATA / The wave's power signature is fluctuating, Captain.
 GEORDI / Wave efficiency has dropped to seventy-three percent...
 RIKER / (off console) The test ship's warp field is becoming unstable... sensors show multiple disruptions.
 DATA / It is expanding toward us, sir. It appears to be interfering with our engines.
 GEORDI / I can't compensate for it!
 PICARD / Take us out of warp, all stop!
 RIKER / Damage report.
 GEORDI / Sensors and warp drive are off-line... deflectors are down to fifteen percent...
 WORF / Minor injuries reported on deck twenty-seven... no fatalities.
 PICARD / (to Data) What happened to the test ship?
 DATA / (working console) Our last readings indicate the craft exploded due to extreme shearing stress.
 WORF / (off console) Incoming message from Bilana Three, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / We sustained some minor damage. Do you know what happened?
 GEORDI / That would be consistant with our telemetry from the ship. We detected a sudden drop in transfer efficiency just before the explosion.
 GEORDI / No, the explosion damaged our main sensor array. But I think we'll have it repaired in a couple of hours.
 PICARD / We'll contact you as soon as the sensors are back on-line.
 GEORDI / Doctor...
 GEORDI / You did it... warp without warp drive... for a while there, it was really something to see.
 GEORDI / So do I.
 WORF / I apologize that I was detained.
 WORF / What sort of... concerns?
 WORF / Perhaps you do not have experience dealing with Klingon children. They require a firm hand.
 WORF / I did not tell him that.
 WORF / (to com) Computer, where is Alexander Rozhenko?
 WORF / I will handle this.
 WORF / (to com) Computer, what program is being run?
 WORF / (to com) Freeze program.
 WORF / (even) Yes, I saw.
 WORF / Why are you here?
 WORF / But you did not ask permission to take my bat'telh or permission to use the holodeck.
 WORF / I also said I wanted you to obey your teachers and keep your promise to me. (off his look) Ms. Kyle has told me about your behavior... about your lies.
 WORF / (anger building) Alexander, do not continue to---
 WORF / (firm) I will not listen to further lies. Return to our quarters.
 WORF / Not now. Not after you have broken your word.
 WORF / (a shout) Enough!
 WORF / (tight) It is now clear to me that I have failed in my duties as your father. You have no understanding of what it means to be Klingon. (long beat) I will arrange for you to attend a Klingon school. There you will learn the lessons I have failed to teach you.
 WORF / Would you dishonor our family further with your disobedience?
 WORF / (even) You will go to our quarters and remain there until I return.
 RIKER / (to com) Bridge to engineering. What's your estimate on the engines, Geordi?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I need another hour, Commander. I still have to replace three power couplings.
 RIKER / Understood.
 DATA / (to Riker) Sensors coming back on-line, sir.
 RIKER / Good. Begin a sensor sweep for the soliton wave.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / The wave is continuing on course for the Lemma Two colony... it is bearing zero two zero, mark three two nine.
 RIKER / (to Tactical Officer) Open a channel back here to Doctor Ja'Dar.
 DATA / (frowns at something) Sir, the wave has increased in velocity. It is now traveling at warp four point one.
 RIKER / (to Ja'Dar) Doctor, we've located the soliton wave. It's still on course for Lemma Two... but its velocity has increased to warp four point one.
 DATA / (breaking in) Sir, the the wave's energy level has increased by a factor of twelve.
 DATA / At this rate, it will have increased by a factor of two hundred by the time it reaches Lemma Two.
 RIKER / (to Ja'Dar) Will they still be able to dissipate the wave?
 TROI / Are you sure this is what you want?
 WORF / It is not a question of what I want... it is a question of what is best for the boy. He will be better off at a Klingon school.
 TROI / Have you discussed this with Alexander?
 WORF / He is a child. I informed him of my decision.
 TROI / I see.
 WORF / You disapprove?
 TROI / I'm not here to approve or disapprove of the way you raise your son. (beat) My concern right now is how this decision is going to affect you.
 TROI / How will you feel when Alexander is gone?
 WORF / I will be... pleased that he is receiving the guidance that he requires.
 TROI / Is that how you felt when he left to live with your parents?
 WORF / That was... different. At that time, I felt he needed a home... a family... things I could not provide for him.
 TROI / I understand. The idea of raising a child can seem like... a tremendous burden, particularly to a solitary parent.
 WORF / (too quickly) He was no burden.
 WORF / I simply knew that a Klingon child would require more... attention than I could provide.
 TROI / I see. (long beat) Have you ever wondered how Alexander felt about being sent away?
 WORF / He was very young. I'm sure he was... confused...
 TROI / Do you think he might have felt... abandoned?
 TROI / After all, he left very soon after K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he not only lost his mother... he lost his father as well.
 WORF / Are you saying that his... misconduct is a result of feeling abandoned?
 TROI / It's possible. Children don't have the experience to handle emotional crises. Instead of dealing with their feelings, they act on them.
 TROI / (gently) Worf... tell me about the last time you spoke with K'Ehleyr... the night she died.
 WORF / We... argued.
 TROI / About what?
 WORF / Alexander. Why she had... not told me about him when he was born.
 TROI / So you were angry with her?
 WORF / (a whisper) Yes.
 TROI / Are you still angry with her?
 WORF / Of course not.
 TROI / (gently) It would be very normal for you to be angry with her... angry because she died and left you alone with a son you never knew you had.
 TROI / Being angry doesn't mean you loved her any less, Worf... but you cannot hide from your feelings... just as Alexander cannot hide from his. (beat) You both have a lot of healing to do... perhaps you should think about doing it together.
 WORF / Alexander...
 WORF / Stop for a moment.
 WORF / Let us... talk.
 WORF / I want you to understand why you're going away.
 WORF / (firm) You do not understand. I am concerned about your future. A Klingon school will be a better environment for you.
 WORF / (getting angry) That is not true.
 WORF / Alexander... if your mother were here... I do not think she would want us to fight like this.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf, please report to the observation lounge.
 WORF / (hits communicator) Acknowledged. (beat, then to Alexander) Remain here. I will return shortly.
 PICARD / Report.
 GEORDI / The soliton wave has---
 WORF / Excuse me.
 GEORDI / The soliton wave has continued to increase in power. Its energy level has risen by a factor of ninety-six. (MORE)
 GEORDI (cont'd) / At its present rate of acceleration, the wave will hit the planet in about two hours.
 PICARD / How do we stop it?
 GEORDI / There are two possibilities: we could try to use our warp engines to generate an inverse resonance wave. If we match the exact frequency and amplitude of the soliton, we'd be able to neutralize it.
 RIKER / You don't sound very confident.
 DATA / Because the soliton is constantly changing in both frequency and amplitude, it will be extremely difficult to achieve a precise match.
 PICARD / Let's hear the second option.
 GEORDI / It's a little more dangerous, but I think there's a better chance for success. We could create a... backfire -- an explosive force set off just in front of the soliton wave. A large enough explosion... say five photon torpedoes... should disrupt the wave and allow it to dissipate.
 PICARD / How fast is the wave travelling now?
 DATA / Warp six point three seven.
 GEORDI / The good news is we can catch it. The bad news is in order to set up the backfire we have to be in front of it.
 DATA / Which would require the Enterprise to go through the wave.
 RIKER / Why can't we go around it?
 DATA / The wave has grown in size as well as power. There is insufficient time remaining for us to circumvent it before it reaches Lemma Two.
 PICARD / How much protection will our shields provide if we attempt to penetrate the wave?
 WORF / The shields have not been fully restored. Shield strength is down to thirty-three percent.
 RIKER / (grim) It would be a rough ride.
 PICARD / (on the move) It's the better choice. Number One, lay in a course for the soliton wave.
 WORF / Captain, may I speak with you?
 PICARD / Certainly.
 WORF / I know that I have been distracted by... family matters and that I have not been performing my duties in a satisfactory manner.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, I have not been dissatisfied with your performance.
 WORF / But I am dissatisfied, Captain. And I will be taking steps which will remedy the problem.
 PICARD / I realize that Klingon officers do not permit their children to live with them. (beat) However, since you first joined Starfleet, you've successfully met many challenges that were seemingly at odds with your Klingon heritage.
 WORF / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / (to Felton) Ensign, after we've passed through the wave, I want you to keep us at a relative position twenty-three kilometers in front of it.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Alert sickbay to prepare for possible casualties.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 DATA / (reading console) The wave has increased speed to warp seven point two.
 PICARD / (to Felton) Take us to warp seven point two one.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Let's see it.
 PICARD / Stand by to increase speed to warp seven point three on my mark, Ensign.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Red Alert. Load torpedo bays and set warhead yields to level sixteen.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (to com) This is the bridge. All decks, brace for impact.
 WORF / Torpedoes loaded.
 PICARD / (to Felton) Engage.
 The lab has been emptied of almost all the tables and displays seen earlier. Alexander moves to the large container and turns ON THE LIGHT. The two Gilvos OPEN THEIR EYES and look at him. Alexander smiles at the / creatures. Suddenly, the ship is ROCKED and Alexander is thrown to the deck.
 PICARD / Report.
 DATA / We have passed through the wave, Captain.
 WORF / Deflector strength down to twelve percent. There are fluctuations in several warp transfer conduits. Transporters and tractor beams off-line.
 RIKER / We have some gaps in the aft shields, Captain. (pointing to monitor) When the torpedoes explode, these areas will be contaminated with ion radiation.
 RIKER / (indicating monitor) We should evacuate sections twenty-four to forty-seven on decks thirty-five through thirty-eight.
 PICARD / Make it so---
 WORF / (interrupting) Sir!
 WORF / (urgent) There is a fire in biolab four! The fire-suppression apparatus... is not functioning.
 PICARD / Seal off the compartment, prepare to vent the air from---
 DATA / (urgent) Sir, there are life-forms present in that biolab.
 RIKER / (to Picard) We're transporting endangered animals from Corvan Two...
 DATA / Sir, readings also indicate the presence of a humanoid.
 PICARD / (quickly, to com) Computer, identify the humanoid life-form in biolab four.
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge to biolab four. Alexander, can you hear us?
 WORF / (tight) Sensors show he is alive... he may be injured.
 RIKER / Can we transport him out of there?
 WORF / (getting frustrated) Transporters are still off-line.
 RIKER / (to com) Bridge to engineering. What's going on, Geordi?
 GEORDI / We lost four warp transfer conduits, Commander.
 RIKER / (urgent) The wave is gaining on us, we need more speed.
 GEORDI / I doubt I can keep this speed up much longer, Commander. You better fire those torpedoes while we're still in front of the wave.
 PICARD / Data, how long until the wave overtakes us?
 DATA / At our current speed... four minutes, thirty seconds.
 WORF / Captain, permission to leave the bridge.
 PICARD / Granted. Number One, accompany Mister Worf to biolab four.
 DATA / (off console) Sir, biolab four is in one of the areas that will be flooded with ion radiation.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Commander.
 PICARD / (firm) I can't let the soliton wave hit the colony. You have three minutes... not one second more.
 RIKER / Primary control's shorted out.
 WORF / Stand clear.
 WORF / Alexander!
 RIKER / Alexander!
 RIKER (o.c.) / Alexander, can you hear me?
 DATA / (to Picard) The soliton wave has closed to ten kilometers, Captain.
 PICARD / (to Tactical Officer) Stand by to fire torpedoes on my command.
 WORF / I've found him, Commander!
 RIKER / Worf!
 WORF (o.c.) / Over here!
 RIKER / It's too heavy. We need something to help us.
 WORF / Be still, I am here.
 RIKER / (objecting) There's no time.
 DATA / The wave has closed to one kilometer, Captain.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Commander Riker.
 PICARD / Bridge to Lieutenant Worf, acknowledge.
 DATA / The wave is about to overtake us, sir.
 PICARD / (frustrated) Commander Riker, acknowledge!
 PICARD / (to Tactical Officer) Fire torpedoes.
 DATA / The wave has been disrupted, Captain.
 PICARD / (urgent, to com) Picard to Riker.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (hoarse) Riker here, Captain.
 RIKER / (to com) We made it, sir. The boy's going to be all right.
 BEVERLY / (to Alexander) You're a very lucky little boy... just some minor smoke inhalation and a hairline fracture of the tibia. (beat, then with a smile) That's a bone in your leg. (to Worf) I'd like to keep him overnight, but he should be fine by tomorrow.
 WORF / Thank you, Doctor.
 WORF / Do not concern yourself with that.
 WORF / (beat) Yes... but we will discuss that at a later time.
 WORF / Klingon schools are designed to be difficult. (MORE)
 WORF (cont'd) / The physical and mental hardships faced by the students are meant to build strength and character. (beat) However, if you wish to face a greater challenge... you may stay here with me.
 WORF / It will not be easy... for either one of us... but, perhaps we can face the challenge together.
 WORF / I believe your... mother would be pleased.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45400.3. Two days ago, Starbase Five-one-four lost contact with the research vessel Vico, which was sent to explore the interior of a Black Cluster. We are en route to investigate.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, ENSIGN FELTON at the conn. / 
 DATA / Sir, I am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations...
 PICARD / Take us out of warp, Ensign.
 WORF / The Black Cluster is in visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / Aye, Captain.
 RIKER / Let's find that ship. Full sensor sweep, Mister Data.
 DATA / (touching panel) Yes, Commander.
 RIKER / It's quite a sight.
 PICARD / (nodding) One of the most ancient formations in the galaxy.
 DATA / I have located the Vico. The vessel appears to be adrift.
 RIKER / Let's see it.
 RIKER / Life signs?
 WORF / Nothing, Commander.
 RIKER / Damage report, Mister Data.
 DATA / (off instruments) The outer and inner hulls have been breached. Decks seven through twelve are exposed to space.
 RIKER / Set up a translink to their computer core. Let's see what happened.
 DATA / I cannot, sir. The emergency bulkheads on that deck are in place. Our linkup signal cannot penetrate them.
 PICARD / (to Data) Structural status, Commander.
 DATA / Stress readings indicate considerable pressure on the transverse supports.
 PICARD / Is it stable enough for an away team?
 DATA / (off instruments) Yes, sir. But the risk of structural collapse is high.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Have transporter room one maintain a lock on each member of your away team. (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / I want you out of there at the first sign of trouble.
 RIKER / Aye, Captain. (to conn) Ensign, take us to fifteen thousand meters.
 RIKER / (heading for door) Data, you're with me.
 DATA / (re: dead monitor) This station is inoperable.
 GEORDI / (re: his console) This one's stuck in a feedback loop.
 RIKER / Let's try to tap directly into the computer core.
 GEORDI / There should be an ODN junction along here somewhere...
 GEORDI / (continuing) This looks like a good possibility...
 RIKER / Careful, Geordi. You don't want to pull out the wrong brick...
 RIKER / Data.
 DATA / (off colors) Core transfer is engaged.
 GEORDI / Exchange protocol verified. (takes reading) The files seem to be intact. Some of them, anyway.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Stay here. (to Data) Data.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. A young boy, shielded from our initial sensor scans, has been discovered alive by the away team. The degree of damage to the Vico is making our rescue attempt difficult...
 PICARD / (to com) Transporter room one, can you lock onto him?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / And transport directly to sickbay?
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (beat) Picard to Crusher.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Sickbay here, Captain.
 PICARD / Standby for emergency transport.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir. Crusher out.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Commander Riker.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Is the boy ready, Number One?
 RIKER / (to boy) Everything's gonna be okay...
 RIKER / (touching combadge) Ready, sir.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / At your signal.
 RIKER / (to com) Aye, Captain.
 RIKER / Alright... here we go...
 RIKER / Energize.
 RIKER / (continuing) That's gotta weigh over a ton, Data. Can you move it?
 DATA / Yes, sir. However, that may initiate the collapse of the surrounding supports. I recommend that you and Geordi return to the ship.
 RIKER / Agreed. (turning) La Forge...
 RIKER / (keys combadge) Whenever you're ready, Data.
 DATA / (to com) Yes, Sir.
 DATA / Yes. Then I will carry you to the corridor. We will transport back to the Enterprise from there. Do you understand?
 DATA / I am an android. My strength is many times that of a human.
 DATA / (continuing) Everything is going to be... okay.
 DATA / I will count to three. (beat) One... two... three...
 DATA / (to com) Energize!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. A thorough search of the Vico has revealed no additional survivors. Troi has begun the process of counseling the boy in regard to the tragedy.
 BEVERLY / (gently) You're safe now, Timothy. You're going to be alright.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) You must be hungry. Would you like me to get you something to eat?
 DATA / Counselor, I must join Commander La Forge in engineering. If you will excuse me --
 TROI / Timothy, would you like Data to stay a little bit longer?
 GEORDI / Sections of the primary and secondary hull were torn right off. (indicating) Shearing planes are here, here, and here.
 PICARD / (re: datastream) How much longer until we can access their logs?
 GEORDI / Less than an hour.
 PICARD / The boy was here.
 GEORDI / (nodding) The hallway outside the computer core.
 GEORDI / (continuing) His mother was the ship's systems engineer. (beat; indicating) The second away team found her body here -- inside the core.
 PICARD / And the boy's father?
 GEORDI / Ship's second officer. (off diagram) He was most likely on the bridge when it was exposed to space.
 PICARD / (grimly) Most likely...
 BEVERLY / He'll sleep for a few hours at least. (to Troi) There's no need to keep him here. But I will need to see him again tomorrow.
 BEVERLY / (continuing to Troi) You've got some work cut out for you.
 TROI / (continuing to Data) His world is gone, Data. We're going to have to help him build a new one.
 GEORDI / This isn't good. I think whatever hit the Vico set up an E-M pulse that flashed through their computer banks.
 DATA / (agreeing) Nearly eighty-three percent of the records have been lost.
 GEORDI / And all of their sensor logs. (sighs) Let's use what we got from our own sensors. Call up the structural analysis and the surface scans...
 DATA / Geordi, as a child, did you ever experience a traumatic event?
 GEORDI / You're wondering about Timothy?
 DATA / Yes.
 GEORDI / I was trapped in a fire once, when I was five -- before I got my VISOR. It only took about two minutes before my parents found me and pulled me out. And nobody got hurt. But I tell you -- that was the longest two minutes of my life. And it was more than a month before I would let my parents get out of earshot. I absolutely needed to know they were there.
 DATA / Timothy no longer has that kind of support.
 GEORDI / (sadly) Yeah...
 GEORDI / Magnetic residual analysis confirms that the Vico was attacked inside the Black Cluster. The graviton wave fronts pushed the ship to where we found it.
 PICARD / No sign of phaser burns on the hull.
 GEORDI / No, sir. The torsional stress levels point to a disrupter-style weapon.
 DATA / Fracture points indicate that the energy burst came from a range of less than three thousand meters.
 PICARD / That's a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or Klingon... But we're quite a distance from either of their territories.
 DATA / The Breen have outposts in this sector. The attack on the Vico is consistent with their battle tactics -- and their level of technology.
 PICARD / But what would they have been doing inside the Black Cluster?
 PICARD / The boy described a boarding party, with helmets and phaser rifles.
 GEORDI / A boarding party?
 GEORDI / (continuing) I don't think that's likely, sir...
 PICARD / Counselor...
 GEORDI / There was absolutely no evidence of anybody coming on board the Vico. We would have found a transporter field trace. Or if somebody had used the entry ports, we would have found an electrostatic differential in the docking latches. We didn't. (beat) Maybe he's got an active imagination.
 PICARD / Or he's lying.
 TROI / If he is lying, I haven't been able to sense it. Perhaps his level of emotional trauma is too high.
 PICARD / Why wouldn't he tell us the truth?
 TROI / He's still in shock... it's hard to know what's going on in his mind.
 GEORDI / I'll check the sensor readings again... but I'm almost sure we won't find anything.
 TROI / Data -- stay a moment.
 TROI / Captain -- I think we should ask Data to spend some time with Timothy.
 DATA / I do not understand.
 TROI / I'm worried about his behavior... And what you've just told me doesn't make me feel any better. Data, you're the only one Timothy's reached out to... because you rescued him. We can use your relationship with him to help his recovery.
 PICARD / Would Timothy also be more inclined to tell Data the truth about what happened?
 TROI / That's a possibility.
 PICARD / (to Data) Mister Data, proceed with the child as Counselor Troi suggests.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / Exactly how shall I proceed, Counselor?
 TROI / Just be with him. You're a presence he trusts. That's what he needs most right now.
 DATA / Hello, Timothy. May I enter?
 DATA / I see you are attempting to recreate the Dokkaran temple of Kural-Hanesh.
 DATA / Do you wish a frank evaluation?
 DATA / It lacks the harmony that characterized this particular temple and Dokkaran culture in general.
 DATA / I am not capable of hatred.
 DATA / You are making an unwarranted extrapolation. I was merely offering an aesthetic analysis of this particular model.
 DATA / Timothy... ?
 DATA / May I suggest a different approach?
 DATA / (continuing) You are attempting to construct the upper tiers before you have completed the lower.
 DATA / (continuing) Observe.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Data.
 DATA / (to Com) Data here.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I need your help with the shield modulators.
 DATA / (to com) I will join you in a moment, Geordi. Data out.
 DATA / Commander La Forge requires my assistance.
 DATA / I am designed to exceed human capacity both mentally and physically.
 DATA / "Better" is a highly subjective term. I do not, for example, possess the ability to experience emotions as humans do.
 DATA / That is correct.
 DATA / My positronic brain is not capable of generating those conditions.
 DATA / That would be acceptable.
 DATA / Goodbye.
 DATA / The Black Cluster was formed almost nine billion years ago when hundreds of protostars collapsed in close proximity. The resulting gravitational forces are violent and highly unpredictable.
 GEORDI / To get anywhere near the center, we'll have to push through the gravitational wavefronts -- just like the science vessel was designed to do. I've adjusted our shields accordingly.
 WORF / The gravitational forces will affect sensor accuracy. Detecting an enemy vessel will be difficult.
 RIKER / Maybe that's what happened to the Vico -- they didn't see anything coming until it was too late.
 PICARD / Has the boy volunteered any further information?
 TROI / No. But we have an appointment in less than an hour.
 PICARD / If there's any possibility of getting more from him, I'd like you to pursue it.
 PICARD / Regardless, we need to continue our investigation. (beat, informing the room) We'll enter the cluster at oh-seven-hundred tomorrow morning. Dismissed.
 TROI / Hello, Timothy. Are you ready to go?
 TROI / How are you feeling, Timothy?
 TROI / Established parameters? You sound like Data.
 TROI / I see... Well. Let's go for our walk, shall we?
 TROI / No, I'm fine, thank you.
 TROI / So... you're no longer a Human?
 TROI / When did this happen?
 TROI / What's it like... being an android?
 TROI / You don't? No emotions at all?
 PICARD / An android.
 TROI / I know it sounds unusual - but it is understandable. Technically, it's called enantiodromia. Conversion into the opposite. Timothy went from Human to machine. From being emotional to being emotionless. But the underlying trauma is still there. He's just found a new way to repress it.
 PICARD / How long will this behavior last?
 TROI / As long as he needs it to. Timothy is rebuilding his identity as best he can. The android persona is only one step along the way. When he becomes stronger and more sure of himself, it should drop away naturally.
 PICARD / I assume this is not a time to confront him about what happened to his ship.
 TROI / Not yet. The best thing we can do right now is to let Timothy take us where he wants to go. We should support the process -- even encourage it.
 PICARD / Mister Data -- I'd like you to make Timothy the best android he can possibly be.
 DATA / Timothy, your head movements are... counterproductive. Can you be still?
 DATA / The servo-mechanisms in my neck are designed to approximate Human movements. (beat) I did not realize the effect was so... distracting.
 DATA / No. I am the only one.
 DATA / My service experience does not yet warrant such a position.
 DATA / Fear is a quality that I do not possess.
 DATA / That is correct.
 DATA / I have never had a nightmare. I do not require sleep.
 DATA / Timothy, are you having... disturbing dreams?
 DATA / Is it satisfactory?
 BEVERLY / Transfer circuits are functioning properly.
 BEVERLY / (nodding) Absolutely.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Input processing, pattern recognition... all within established parameters.
 DATA & TIMOTHY / (simultaneously) Thank you, Doctor.
 DATA / You may use mine.
 DATA / Perhaps you should return to your quarters.
 DATA / Thank you.
 DATA / It is very... expressive.
 DATA / Is your painting representative of something?
 DATA / Timothy, you understand that you may speak with me about anything you wish -- any subject.
 DATA / At times I too find it difficult to share my thoughts with others. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / I am not always confident that I am expressing myself in a way that Humans will comprehend. But I know that...
 GEORDI / (re: PADD) That's fine.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Just make sure the tolerance doesn't slip more than point three one in either direction.
 DATA (o.s.) / Hello, Geordi.
 GEORDI / Hey, Data.
 DATA / I hope I am not disturbing your work.
 GEORDI / (re: console) Nope. Just finishing up here.
 GEORDI / You need something?
 DATA / I would like to confide in you, Geordi. However, I am finding my thoughts difficult to verbalize.
 GEORDI / It's about Timothy.
 DATA / (surprised) How did you know?
 GEORDI / If I had a boy going around pretending to be just like me, I might be a little uncomfortable too.
 DATA / I am not capable of being uncomfortable. But I am undergoing a perceptual paradigm shift.
 GEORDI / You better define that for me, Data.
 DATA / I have spent my entire life emulating Humans. Now, I find myself confronted by a Human who is emulating me.
 GEORDI / I got you... the shoe's on the other foot...
 DATA / Ah, the metaphor... yes, that is correct. I am forced to realize that I have largely ignored the aspects of myself that others would find attractive.
 GEORDI / That's a very Human thing to do, Data.
 GEORDI / A lot of us have a way of not appreciating ourselves. We're too close to the subject. (beat) Keep an eye on Timothy... he might help you learn to understand yourself a little better.
 WORF / We are approaching the perimeter.
 WORF / (off instruments) I'm picking up the gravitational wavefronts.
 RIKER / Engage forward shields -- thirty-five percent.
 WORF / Shields up.
 PICARD / Drop to one quarter impulse, Ensign.
 RIKER / (to com) Bridge to engineering.
 GEORDI / (to com) Adjusting shield frequencies now, Commander. We'll have this smoothed out in just a second...
 RIKER / Correct for any course deviations, Ensign.
 RIKER / Resume one-third impulse.
 WORF / -- Captain!
 WORF / (continuing) I am reading something at four hundred thousand kilometers, off our starboard bow. Possibly a ship.
 RIKER / Red alert.
 PICARD / Take us to visual range, Ensign.
 WORF / (puzzled; off instruments) Sensor readings have disappeared... Now picking up another reading at four hundred thousand kilometers -- off the port bow. (beat) It's gone... No -- it's back to starboard.
 RIKER / (off instruments) Captain, the Black Cluster is distorting the sensors. We're picking up echoes of the Enterprise reflecting off the wavefronts.
 PICARD / Cancel Red Alert. Adjust the sensors to compensate for the distortion.
 WORF / Aye...
 PICARD / Sensor difficulties have been reported by ships traveling through Black Clusters -- but not to this extreme.
 WORF / This formation is seven times more massive than any previously explored. That could explain the difference.
 PICARD / (to Felton) Resume previous course.
 DATA / He laughed.
 TROI / Yes. It's nice to see, isn't it... ?
 DATA / It is certainly not consistent with his android persona...
 TROI / I'd say he's beginning the process of letting go of that fantasy...
 DATA / Then my work with him is complete?
 TROI / (beat) No, I don't think it is, Data... A laugh is one step in the right direction... we need to help him take a few more steps...
 DATA / How, Counselor?
 TROI / I'd like you to talk to him... about your own fascination with humanity.
 TROI / If you can explain the appeal that humanity has for you... Timothy might find it easier to become a boy again.
 DATA / The complex polysaccharides, in reaction with the carbon dioxide, produces an unusual combination of texture and efforvescence.
 DATA / I am not capable of "tasting" in the manner which you describe. I can analyze the composition of a dessert and make comparative conclusions about its possible effect on the human palate. However, I neither like it, nor dislike it...
 DATA / I have often wondered what it must be like... to have one's mouth "water" in anticipation of the arrival of a confection... Or to feel the pleasure I have observed in people as they consume it...
 DATA / I am an android. That will never change.
 DATA / I have always wished to be Human. I study people carefully in order to more closely approximate Human behavior.
 DATA / But I cannot take pride in my abilities. I cannot take pleasure in my accomplishments.
 DATA / I would gladly risk feeling bad at times... if it meant that I could also taste my dessert.
 WORF / Captain, gravitational wavefront intensity is increasing steadily -- eleven hundred standard "G" units and rising.
 PICARD / (turning to Worf) Let's see if anyone's out there. Attempt a wide-range sensor sweep, Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / (touching controls) Aye, sir.
 WORF / (shaking head) The gravitational distortion is too great, Captain. The scanning signal is again being reflected off the wavefronts. But I am unable to compensate. (looks up) The sensors are useless.
 PICARD / (to com) Mister Data to the bridge, please.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Adjust sensors to short range... attempt a limited positron scan...
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WORF / The distortion is still in effect.
 RIKER / Try to jacket the scanning beam.
 WORF / The secondary beam is being distorted as well.
 PICARD / Mister Data, our sensors have been rendered ineffective by the field distortion. I want your analysis...
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister Worf, fire phasers, maximum intensity, narrow spectrum, zero zero one mark zero four five.
 RIKER / (understanding) An experiment, Captain?
 PICARD / Exactly.
 WORF / Firing, Sir.
 PICARD / Explanation, Mister Data.
 DATA / The phaser energy was reflected by the gravitational wavefronts. It is similar to the phenomenon distorting the sensor signals.
 PICARD / Our sensors and our phasers -- both useless. (to Data) This reflection phenomenon -- would it have the same effect on a disruptor-style weapon?
 DATA / Yes, sir. Disruptors would be ineffectual.
 PICARD / And a ship's cloaking field?
 DATA / It would be extremely difficult to maintain.
 PICARD / Mister Data, is it at all likely that the Vico was attacked inside the cluster?
 DATA / Given the effects we have observed, the probability is exceedingly remote.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Troi.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / (to com) Please bring Timothy to my ready room.
 PICARD / (gently) Timothy, can you tell us what happened to your ship?
 TROI / Tell us again...
 DATA / That is highly unlikely. Our investigations have clearly demonstrated --
 DATA / Timothy, androids do not lie.
 DATA / Please explain.
 PICARD / What didn't you mean to do, Timothy?
 TROI / The ship was damaged when your arm hit the computer panel... ?
 TROI / Timothy, listen to me -- the damage to your ship might have occurred at the same time you touched the panel but it was only a coincidence... this was not your fault...
 DATA / It is not possible. The onboard control systems for every starship require a user code clearance. You could not have inadvertantly affected any of the Vico's systems.
 PICARD / Your computer had safety precautions. There's nothing you could have touched that would have damaged your ship.
 TROI / You're not responsible for what happened to your parents.
 PICARD / We're trying to determine what happened right now. And anything that you can remember that may assist...
 WORF / Wavefront intensity has increased...
 RIKER / Increase shields to seventy-five percent.
 WORF / Aye.
 RIKER / Damage, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Minimal, Sir. The shields are holding.
 PICARD / Ensign, full about -- go to warp two.
 PICARD / Full shields.
 WORF / Aye.
 TROI / Timothy, I think you and I should go below... get out of everyone's way, okay... ?
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to La Forge. Can you give me more power to the shields?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Stand by...
 DATA / Timothy, accompany me...
 DATA / (on the move) I want you to recall everything you heard people say aboard the Vico before it was destroyed...
 GEORDI / (to com) I've transferred fusion reactors four through nine into the shield array.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / That should double the shield strength.
 WORF / Wavefront intensity has increased by an order of magnitude. Impact in three - two - one.
 WORF / (off instruments) Wave front intensity is continuing to increase. Structural overpressure is exceeding one hundred eighty percent.
 PICARD / (to com) La Forge...
 GEORDI / (to com) I don't understand. That should have been enough.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We could run the shield grid directly off the warp drive.
 PICARD / (to com) Make it so.
 WORF / (working instruments) Initiating warp transfer pathways now...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Diverting warp power to the shields.
 WORF / (off instruments) Wavefront intensity has increased by a factor of ten. Contact in forty-seven seconds. Without additional power to the shields, the outer hull will not hold...
 RIKER / (to com) La Forge...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Warp transfer to the shields complete. That's as strong as they're gonna get.
 WORF / Impact in fifteen seconds.
 DATA / Drop the shields.
 RIKER / That's suicide, Data.
 DATA / Captain, drop the shields.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Drop the shields.
 WORF / ("what?!") Aye.
 DATA / Our own shields caused the increase in the wavefronts... we induced harmonic amplification effects.
 RIKER / The more energy we dumped into the shield grid, the worse the impact...
 DATA / Precisely. And that is also what destroyed the Vico. When Timothy remembered similar procedures aboard his ship, I initiated an analysis of shield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation.
 PICARD / If we had transferred all that warp power to the shields, it would've torn the ship apart.
 RIKER / Status, Ensign.
 PICARD / Full about, one quarter impulse. Take us out of here.
 TROI (o.s.) / It would seem that our young "android" is finding his way back to humanity.
 DATA / It would appear so, Counselor.
 TROI / It'll take a while for his emotions to catch up. Timothy's a boy feeling a great deal of pain. But he is a boy again.
 TROI / Is this.. difficult for you, Data?
 DATA / Difficult?
 TROI / To watch him... moving away from being like you...
 DATA / No, Counselor. That would require an emotional context which I cannot provide.
 DATA (o.s.) / Hello, Timothy.
 DATA / I am operating within established parameters. How are you?
 DATA / Is something wrong?
 DATA / On the contrary, it is said that imitation is the highest form of flattery. I was... flattered.
 DATA / I have many Human friends. I would be pleased to count you among them.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45429.3. While on a mapping survey of sector two-two-one-three-nine, we are conveying a delegation of Ullians to Kaldra Four. These telepathic historians conduct their research by retrieving long-forgotten memories.
 BEVERLY / You remember such vivid details... it's remarkable.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) What about you, Commander? Any memories you feel like digging up?
 RIKER / (grinning) None that I'd want to share with an audience.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Reports of the Ullians' remarkable feats have piqued my interest. I have invited the senior staff to a Captain's Dinner in honor of our guests.
 DATA / It is perplexing to me that the Ullians' ability to retrieve memory is so sought after. If an event is important enough to be recovered... why would it have been forgotten?
 GEORDI / It's not quite the same for us as it is for you, Data. You record every second of every event in your life...
 DATA / That is correct.
 GEORDI / And if you want to recall any one of those seconds, you just access the proper memory circuit.
 DATA / My understanding of the Human brain suggests that the process is the same for you. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / Each memory is encoded in chains of molecules, and when you want to retrieve it, you simply access the proper RNA sequence.
 GEORDI / Well, yeah, that's true...
 DATA / Then in what way is it different?
 GEORDI / Sometimes... There are memories we just can't tap into. For instance... I have no recollection of what I did on my last birthday. Birthdays are important occasions... you'd think I'd remember how I spent the day. But I can't even remember where I was.
 GEORDI / Deck two. On the other hand -- I remember everything about the time I got my first pet... a Circassian cat. I was eight. I remember how funny he looked... how excited I was... it's as if it happened last week.
 DATA / Perhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget the unpleasant ones?
 GEORDI / Well, not really. Sometimes the bad memories are the most intense of all.
 DATA / It would seem there is no predictable pattern to Human memory.
 GEORDI / It would seem.
 PICARD / Rather like the ancient oral historians of Earth.
 RIKER / Sounds like quite a project... how long will it take to finish your studies on Kaldra?
 BEVERLY / (with feigned innocence) Captain, Mister Tarmin gave us a demonstration of his abilities this afternoon. It's fascinating. Perhaps you'd like to resurrect some memories...
 PICARD / I'm sure. However, I don't think I'm a particularly good candidate --
 BEVERLY / (gently twisting) I'm sure you'd be ideal. And you must have some intriguing memories...
 PICARD / Yes, well...
 WORF / Klingons do not allow themselves to be "probed."
 WORF / I am not fearful.
 GEORDI / I don't think so. Thanks anyway.
 TROI / Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians able to read memories?
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / Four days, eleven hours, sir.
 TROI / Jev...
 TROI / No, not at all...
 TROI / It's not easy having an overbearing parent. Believe me, I know how you feel.
 TROI / I can't read Ullians. But, I do know a certain Betazoid mother who is a great deal like your father.
 TROI / Deck eight. I've learned to remind myself that my mother and I are two separate individuals.
 TROI / No... but I keep reminding myself.
 TROI / Good night.
 RIKER'S VOICE / Have you stopped thinking about us?
 TROI / Hot chocolate.
 RIKER / Have you stopped thinking about us?
 TROI / Will...
 RIKER / We have to talk about this...
 TROI / Imzadi... we can't... not when we're serving on the same ship...
 RIKER / Have you stopped thinking about us? Just answer that...
 RIKER / I can't stop thinking about you...
 TROI / No... don't...
 RIKER / Have you stopped thinking about us?
 TROI / Will... we mustn't do this...
 TROI / No, Will --
 TROI / No, don't...
 TROI / Don't do this... !
 TROI / (screaming) No... no... no...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45430.9. Counselor Troi has fallen into a deep coma. After a thorough examination, Doctor Crusher has been unable to find any sign of illness or infection.
 BEVERLY / Any change, Doctor?
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Can you bring her out of it?
 BEVERLY / I've tried standard revival techniques... she doesn't respond. Until I know what caused this, I don't want to try anything more extreme.
 RIKER / Do we know what she was doing when this happened?
 BEVERLY / No. She was found in her quarters this morning when she didn't show up for an appointment. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (cont'd) / She was dressed for bed... but the bed wasn't slept in.
 PICARD / Who was the last person to speak with her?
 RIKER / She left the dinner last night with one of the Ullians.
 RIKER / I'll talk to him.
 BEVERLY / I'll check the biofilter readings from the Ullians' transporter logs. It's possible they could still be carrying some harmful organism.
 PICARD / Commander, ask if they would consent to examinations -- just to be certain.
 RIKER / May I join you?
 RIKER / Counselor Troi is ill.
 RIKER / More than ill... she's in a coma. Doctor Crusher doesn't know what's causing it or how to treat her.
 RIKER / Apparently some time last night. That's why I wanted to talk to you... you may have been the last person to see her. Did you go with her into her quarters?
 RIKER / Not at all... I'm just trying to trace her steps.
 RIKER / (surprised at the defensiveness) Jev -- I'm not accusing you of anything.
 RIKER / Did she mention feeling ill?
 RIKER / (letting that pass) If you have no objection, Doctor Crusher would like to examine you and your group...
 RIKER / She'd like to eliminate the possibility that one of you might be carrying some organism that was harmful to Deanna.
 RIKER / I'm not implying that you've done anything intentional. I am just trying to get to the bottom of a mystery...
 RIKER / (after a beat) Fine. Thank you.
 RIKER / Deanna... I don't know if you can hear me. (beat) I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be able to hear when people talk to them... that it might even help stimulate the brain and speed the healing... (a beat, remembering) In fact, I think you did that for me once, when I was in pretty bad shape...
 RIKER / So I just thought... maybe it would help to hear a friendly voice... (with a wry smile) ... even if you don't know you're hearing it.
 RIKER / We've been busy mapping the sector... it's pretty routine. So far the most unusual thing we've seen is a binary star system... I finished that personnel review we were working on... you can check it over when you... (a beat, as he realizes it might not happen) ... wake up.
 RIKER / I miss you. So don't stay away too long, okay?
 BEVERLY (o.c.) / Will... ?
 BEVERLY / Will... I promise I'll let you know the minute she regains consciousness.
 RIKER / I know...
 BEVERLY / There's nothing you can do here. You're going to wear yourself out...
 RIKER / Right...
 BEVERLY / It's late... go to bed. (beat) That's an order.
 RIKER / Out, out, out! Let's go!
 RIKER / Ensign Keller, can you hear me?
 RIKER / Come on, move it!
 GEORDI / Commander, I need to bring that door down!
 RIKER / Keller, can you get to a Jeffries Tube?
 RIKER / Ensign Keller, answer me.
 GEORDI / Commander, radiation levels are critical -- we've gotta seal it off.
 RIKER / (makes decision) Bring down the door!
 RIKER / (waving people out) Out, out out! Let's go!
 RIKER / Riker to transporter room three. Prepare to beam Ensign Keller out of the engine room.
 RIKER / Ensign Keller, answer me.
 GEORDI / I've gotta get the isolation door down!
 RIKER / Bring down the door!
 GEORDI (V.O.) / I need that door down!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Commander Riker...
 PICARD / Commander, do you read me? (beat) Picard to Commander Riker, answer please.
 PICARD / Computer, locate Commander Riker.
 WORF / On my way, sir.
 RIKER / 
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Medical log, stardate 45431.7. Commander Riker is the second officer who has fallen into an unexplained coma. I have examined the Ullians and ruled out the possibility that they carry a harmful organism.
 BEVERLY / I compared Deanna's brain scan to one I took during her last physical. There is a difference... this time there's a trace of electropathic activity.
 PICARD / And Commander Riker?
 BEVERLY / I found the same pattern. If I didn't know better, I'd think they had Iresine Syndrome. It's the only medical condition that would produce that pattern.
 WORF / What is Iresine Syndrome?
 BEVERLY / A very rare neurological disorder first diagnosed in the twenty-third century. It's characterized by an identical electropathic residue.
 PICARD / Then why discount the possibility that it's responsible for their comas?
 BEVERLY / Iresine is always accompanied by a severely decreased histamine count. Both Will and Deanna show normal levels. (beat) I've asked Commander La Forge to conduct a shipwide diagnostic for any other agents which could produce that electropathic pattern.
 WORF / Counselor Troi and Commander Riker were in perfect health -- until the Ullians got here.
 WORF / It would be wise to quarantine the aliens.
 PICARD / I believe it's premature to take that kind of action. We have no real evidence linking these comas to the Ullians.
 BEVERLY / That's true. But there is something curious...
 BEVERLY / The electropathic residue I discovered is located in the thalamus. That's the area of the cerebral cortex which involves memory function.
 PICARD / I mean no disrespect, sir. But we are faced with an alarming situation...
 PICARD / Suspect is perhaps too strong a word. I am simply trying to determine what has caused two of my officers to fall into comas.
 BEVERLY / But in further study of the victims, I noticed some abnormal patterns in the area of the brain which involves memory.
 PICARD / In light of your particular telepathic abilities, it does raise the question...
 BEVERLY / If I could do further examinations tomorrow... perhaps monitor you during a memory probe...
 BEVERLY / Thank you. I'll contact you tomorrow morning.
 BEVERLY / You're the only person on board who's undergone a memory probe by the Ullians. I'd like to do a neurological work-up... see if I can detect any residual effect.
 BEVERLY / Doctor Martin will monitor your vital signs while I do the scan.
 BEVERLY / Have you had any unusual symptoms since the probe? Headaches? Dizziness?
 BEVERLY / (reading tricorder) Electrical activity is normal... CPK levels are normal... the hippocampus is stable... and the thalamus... (beat) ... the thalamus is normal. (to Martin) There's no indication at all of the electropathic residue.
 BEVERLY / You're fine, Keiko. But we're no closer to solving this mystery.
 GEORDI / Computer, locate the electropathic pattern described in medical database four-delta-one.
 GEORDI / Okay, we're gonna track down any possible cause of that brain pattern. First, what are the medical conditions that might account for it?
 GEORDI / Right. And Doctor Crusher's already eliminated that. How many nonmedical forces or substances might cause the pattern?
 GEORDI / Okay. And how many of those are present on the Enterprise?
 GEORDI / Are the ship's sensors calibrated to detect all those agents?
 GEORDI / Okay. Let's start with the chemical substances. Name them.
 GEORDI / Ferrazene has a complex molecular structure... it breaks down into bilenium and tarrisite. Do the sensors scan for those?
 GEORDI / And are they present on the Enterprise?
 GEORDI / Do any of the substances break down into by-products that are not scanned for?
 GEORDI / Well, this isn't a routine situation. Scan for nilizene.
 GEORDI / Why did I know you were going to say that?
 GEORDI / Okay. Let's move on to nonchemical agents.
 BEVERLY / No, thanks. I was just doing some reading on Iresine Syndrome. If a new strain has developed, that might explain the normal histamine count.
 BEVERLY / Not so far.
 PICARD'S VOICE / You shouldn't remember him like this.
 PICARD / You don't have to do this...
 BEVERLY / It's important to me. I have to see him.
 BEVERLY / It's good of you to come with me.
 PICARD / It's the least I can do...
 PICARD / You shouldn't remember him like this.
 BEVERLY / I have to face the fact that he's gone.
 BEVERLY / I have to see him.
 PICARD / You shouldn't remember him like this...
 BEVERLY / It's good of you to come with me.
 PICARD / It's the least I can do...
 PICARD / You don't have to do this...
 BEVERLY / It's important to me.
 PICARD_JEV / It's the least I can do...
 GEORDI / I've spent two hours having a cozy chat with the computer. I've checked everything I can think of -- any possible agent that might cause that electropathic pattern.
 DATA / I would assume from the tone of your voice that you were unsuccessful.
 GEORDI / Didn't find a thing.
 GEORDI / And the Doctor's not gonna like hearing that --
 DATA / Emergency medical team to Doctor Crusher's office immediately.
 GEORDI / Doctor Crusher had me working on a shipwide diagnostic. I'd gone to give her the results when I found her.
 PICARD / Did your scans provide any insights into these comas?
 GEORDI / None. I checked and cross-checked... they were just dead ends.
 DATA / We seem to have eliminated all known factors that could have caused the comas -- except for the Ullians.
 PICARD / Mister Data, I want you to investigate those eleven planets the Ullians have visited. See if there have been any reports of unexplained comas.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / In the meantime, we must consider restricting them to their quarters. As a precautionary measure...
 GEORDI / If one of them is behind this... will keeping telepaths in their quarters prevent it from happening again?
 PICARD / What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? I don't know if those would be any more effective...
 PICARD / Picard here...
 PICARD / I'm on my way.
 TROI / It's like waking up from a nightmare... but not remembering what it was about.
 PICARD / What's the last thing you do remember?
 TROI / My hair... I was brushing my hair.
 PICARD / And then... ?
 TROI / I don't know... just... waking up here...
 TROI / Why do I feel so frightened? What happened to me?
 PICARD / We were hoping you could tell us.
 TROI / How long have I been here?
 TROI / (stunned) Three days... ?
 PICARD / You were the first. The next day Commander Riker fell into a similar coma... and last night -- Doctor Crusher.
 TROI / (amazed) What is going on here... ?
 PICARD / We aren't certain. (beat) It may be... that there is some unusual effect produced by the Ullians' telepathic activity.
 PICARD / I'm going to talk to them. In the meantime, you're to stay here and recuperate. And if you remember anything about what happened to you... let me know immediately.
 PICARD / That you voluntarily confine yourself to quarters. At least until we unravel this mystery.
 PICARD / Please don't think of it that way.
 PICARD / We have done everything we can think of to explain these comas. We've performed physical examinations and neurological scans... we have conducted a shipwide diagnostic, looking for viruses and parasites and infestations...
 PICARD / We have investigated every possible cause we can imagine. And we have found nothing -- nothing -- to explain the comas.
 PICARD / The only variable we cannot eliminate... is your presence on this ship. (beat) In light of these efforts, I ask you to understand my request. And to honor it.
 PICARD / I know that.
 PICARD / I am simply trying to consider all possibilities.
 PICARD / If that is possible, of course.
 PICARD / I'm sorry. But I cannot subject the Counselor to a potentially dangerous procedure.
 PICARD / No...
 PICARD / I will discuss the matter with the Counselor.
 GEORDI / Well, that's it for Melina Two. No unexplained comas during the time the Ullians were working there. We're striking out everywhere.
 DATA / We have yet to receive transmissions from the two planets of the Nel system. Perhaps they will show different results.
 GEORDI / Maybe... (a thought) Or maybe... we're not checking for the right thing.
 DATA / Please clarify.
 GEORDI / We didn't look into the comas that were explained.
 DATA / (puzzled) Why would we do that?
 GEORDI / Remember what Doctor Crusher said right after Counselor Troi became unconscious? That it looked exactly like Iresine syndrome except for the histamine count?
 DATA / Yes.
 GEORDI / Maybe not every medical facility is as careful as Doctor Crusher. Maybe it's easier to give a quick diagnosis to something than to keep hunting for the real cause.
 DATA / You are checking for instances of Iresine Syndrome...
 GEORDI / Right... and correlating them with visits by the Ullians -- (sees something on monitor) -- and there we are.
 DATA / Two cases of Iresine Syndrome on Hurada Three -- right at the time Tarmin and his group was there.
 GEORDI / Let's try the other planets. I think we may have something.
 PICARD / Counselor, I want to reiterate... if you have any doubts about this procedure, you don't have to go through with it.
 TROI / I want to do it, Captain. Something awful happened to me... and I can't even remember what it was.
 PICARD / Very well.
 TROI / Brushing my hair...
 TROI / Yes... when I'm ready for bed... (she frowns)
 TROI / Someone... touching my hair...
 TROI / No... I'm alone. No one's there.
 TROI / I get some hot chocolate...
 TROI / I'm alone in my quarters... and I'm remembering something from a few years ago...
 TROI / Yes... and...
 TROI / (smiling) It's Will Riker... that's right... I was thinking of him...
 TROI / Yes... after a poker game...
 TROI / ... but now he's hurting me... no...
 TROI / I want him to stop...
 TROI / It's not Will... somebody's taken his place...
 TROI / (shaking her head) No... no... he shouldn't be there... why is he there? No... no... he's hurting me...
 TROI / Yes...
 TROI / No... stop... you're hurting me...
 TROI / It's Tarmin... it's your father!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45433.2. We have set a course for Starbase Four-forty, where the Ullians will disembark and return to their home planet.
 PICARD / I'm not sure we have any legal basis for prosecution... memory invasion simply isn't a crime we've ever had to contend with.
 PICARD / What would motivate someone like your father to commit such an act?
 PICARD / Your father claims -- quite strenuously -- that he is innocent.
 PICARD / This must be very hard for you.
 PICARD / Picard to Data.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / How's your search coming?
 DATA / We have uncovered several cases, sir, but we have not yet completed our search.
 PICARD / We'll want to inform the medical personnel on those planets that we have discovered the true nature of the comas. I'm sure they would appreciate knowing what really happened.
 DATA / We will keep searching, sir.
 GEORDI / We just got the transmission from the Nel system. No mention of Iresine Syndrome... but there are two unexplained comas on one planet... none on the other.
 DATA / And were the Ullians present?
 GEORDI / Checking their mission logs... (studies the screen, looks puzzled) That's funny...
 DATA / What is it?
 GEORDI / On stardates 45321 and 45323, when the comas occurred... Tarmin was on his home planet. (looking at Data) He wasn't anywhere near the Nel system.
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / Hello, Jev.
 TROI / There's no need... you're not responsible for what he did.
 TROI / We still can...
 TROI / Jev... you're upset. Would you like to talk?
 TROI / You'd feel better if you did...
 TROI / What... what's happening... ?
 TROI / It's happening again...
 TROI / It was you... it was always you...
 TROI / No...
 TROI / No -- no --
 TROI / No -- I won't let you!
 WORF / Let go of her!
 DATA / Counselor, are you hurt?
 TROI / No... why... why did you come here? How did you know?
 DATA / We discovered two instances of unexplained comas on Nel Three while the Ullians were there... but Tarmin was not part of the group. A closer examination revealed that only one Ullian was present at all incidents of coma -- Jev.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45435.8. Doctor Crusher and Commander Riker regained consciousness while we were en route to the Ullian home world. The slow process of their recovery has begun.
 BEVERLY / They have been in contact with us already. Thank you...
 PICARD / Earth was once a violent planet, too. At times, the chaos seemed to threaten the very fabric of life.
 PICARD / Like you, we have evolved. We've learned to find better ways to handle our conflicts. (beat) But no one would deny that a seed of violence remains in every one of us. The potential for it is always there. We must learn to recognize it... because that violence is capable of consuming each of us. Just as it consumed your son.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45470.1. The Enterprise has been diverted to the Moab sector to track a stellar core fragment of a disintegrated neutron star. Our science teams have been asked to monitor the planetary disruptions it may cause.
 RIKER leaning over DATA at ops, reacting with concern / to something. WORF, TROI, and GEORDI are also at their stations. Picard ENTERS from the ready room.
 RIKER / (to Picard) We've got a problem... our core fragment is going to pass by Moab Four in six days...
 PICARD / Isn't that what we anticipated?
 RIKER / We didn't anticipate that somebody would be living there.
 DATA / An artificial environment has been constructed on the southern continent, sir.
 PICARD / Have you definitely established someone's inside it?
 DATA / Yes, Captain. Sensors are reading Human lifeforms.
 PICARD / (reacts) Human.
 RIKER / Has there been a response to our hails, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Negative, Commander.
 PICARD / Any starships ever reported missing in this sector, Data?
 DATA / Nossir.
 RIKER / How the hell did they get themselves on a deserted planet?
 GEORDI / I'm pretty sure they know we're here...
 PICARD / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / I'm picking up deep E-M readings... looks like wave emissions from an obsolete subspace relay...
 RIKER / Which would suggest they also have the ability to communicate with us.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, open the lower band frequencies that were most commonly used in the last century...
 WORF / Channel open.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. It is urgent that you respond.
 WORF / Sir, defensive shields around the structure are increasing strength.
 RIKER / Not exactly a welcome mat.
 PICARD / We mean you no harm. We must warn you that your planet is about to experience massive seismic disruptions due to an approaching stellar core fragment. No structure will be able to withstand them.
 WORF / They are responding.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Mister Conor, we were unaware of any Human colony in this system.
 PICARD / The fragment will begin to have serious effects on your planet in six days.
 RIKER / Mister Data... ?
 DATA / (to viewscreen) The fragment has a density of one hundred billion kilograms per cubic centimeter. As a result, when it passes Moab Four, it will cause tectonic shifts well beyond eight-point-seven on the Richter Scale.
 PICARD / I'm afraid we're going to have to evacuate your people.
 RIKER / The alternative, sir, is dying...
 PICARD / Mister Conor, if you wish, we will find you another isolated planet that is safe.
 RIKER / Maybe we haven't made ourselves clear...
 PICARD / (with diplomacy) We will gladly explore the possibility with you, Mister Conor... would you care to come aboard to discuss it?
 PICARD / We are capable of matter_energy transport...
 PICARD / We can take you directly through the structure.
 PICARD / (genial, inviting) May we arrange for your transport?
 PICARD / Very good. Commander Riker and an away team will join you shortly. Picard out.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Limit the away team to three people, Will...
 RIKER / Geordi -- I want to overwhelm him with evidence...
 GEORDI / Understood.
 RIKER / (to Troi) Counselor, I'd like you with us on this one...
 TROI / It's lovely... I can understand why you are reluctant to leave, Mister Conor...
 RIKER / Engineered... ?
 TROI / All of you... have been selectively bred? Your DNA patterns chosen?
 GEORDI / Beyond us...
 GEORDI / I can see you just fine, sir.
 GEORDI / (a poor opinion) What "function" would that be?
 RIKER / A judge.
 TROI / And obviously you do.
 RIKER / Kind of takes some of fun out of choosing, doesn't it?
 TROI / We will do whatever we can to help you preserve it.
 GEORDI / (uncomfortable at her stare) It's a sensory organ replacement. It allows me to see.
 GEORDI / (impatient) I'll be glad to show it to you if there's time...
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Mister La Forge... Troi and I will return to the Enterprise... when you reach a conclusion, let us know...
 GEORDI / Yessir.
 TROI / (to Riker) Commander, if Mister Conor wouldn't object... I'd like to stay... and see more of his colony...
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. One to beam up.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged, Commander.
 RIKER / Energize.
 TROI / You're sure my being here is not going to be disruptive... ?
 TROI / I certainly don't wish to throw off your entire "balance"...
 TROI / Seriously.
 TROI / There must be other unexpected events you have to deal with -- an untimely death, an accident...
 TROI / Not at all.
 TROI / I feel the same about being here... I'm something of a student of Human nature... I find this all fascinating...
 TROI / I'm the ship's counselor.
 TROI / (smiles, good) I'd book my next vacation at your hotel if you had one.
 GEORDI / ... The planet's orbit is completely disrupted and the surface stability becomes almost nonexistent as the core fragment passes by...
 GEORDI / That's how I see it.
 GEORDI / We have a matter_antimatter warp reaction system, the most powerful in Starfleet... normally kicks plasma up into the terawatt range... what are you thinking about?
 GEORDI / (reacts) We can move a small moon or an asteroid, but a stellar core fragment? That's way too massive for our tractor beam...
 GEORDI / What's that?
 GEORDI / A multiphase tractor beam?
 GEORDI / Hannah would have to come with us to the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / It won't affect her DNA at all... There's been a century of evidence to prove that...
 GEORDI / (keys combadge) Enterprise, three to beam up.
 TROI / (to Conor) May I return later?
 GEORDI / Energize.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45472.8. Commander La Forge and Hannah Bates of the Genome Colony have spent nearly three days trying to find a way to adjust the path of the approaching core fragment. If they do not succeed in the next forty-eight hours, I see no alternative but to begin evacuation.
 TROI / I believe some will choose to risk death rather than leave, Captain...
 PICARD / You've spent a good deal of time on the surface, Counselor. How do you suggest we change their minds... ?
 TROI / I'm not sure we can. It means abandoning their fundamental way of life.
 PICARD / (frowns) They've managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavor into dogma...
 TROI / You don't approve of genetic engineering.
 PICARD / It was a bad idea whose time passed long ago.
 TROI / They seem to have made it succeed.
 PICARD / They have given their humanity away to this genetic manipulation... many of the qualities they breed out -- the uncertainty, the self-discovery, the unknown - those are the very qualities that make Human life worth living... at least to me. I would not like to live with the knowledge that much of my future has been written, that my boundaries have been set. Would you?
 TROI / I've asked myself that question a lot during the past few days. I don't know. I doubt it. Nevertheless, this is what they believe in... and it won't be an easy matter to talk them into leaving...
 PICARD / This leader of theirs, Conor, he seems like a reasonable man, doesn't he?
 TROI / I find him very reasonable. Open to suggestions, thoughtful, quite disarming... the perfect administrator...
 PICARD / (grunts) I'm sure. (beat) Will he leave when he sees there is no other choice?
 TROI / I don't know. I hope so.
 PICARD / You admire him.
 TROI / Yes.
 PICARD / Try at least to help him accept the reality of what may happen to his colony. If he makes the right decision, and he's as good a leader as he was "designed" to be... perhaps the others will follow him.
 GEORDI / It's just gonna blow the emitters again.
 GEORDI / I haven't slept in so long, my eyelids feel like they have lead weights attached...
 GEORDI / Uh?
 GEORDI / Ah, I'm sorry... I probably shocked the hell outta you, didn't I...
 GEORDI / Let me put it on...
 GEORDI / I've never been embarrassed by this, Hannah. Never. I was blind at birth. It's the way I've always been.
 GEORDI / I guess if I had been conceived on your world, I wouldn't be here right now, would I?
 GEORDI / I'd've been terminated as a fertilized cell.
 GEORDI / Who gave them the right to choose whether or not I should be here? Whether or not I might have something to contribute...
 GEORDI / The VISOR scans the electromagnetic spectrum between one hertz and one hundred thousand terahertz, converts it all to usable frequencies and carries the information directly to the brain.
 GEORDI / A bank of preprocessors compresses the data stream into pulses so my visual cortex isn't...
 GEORDI / Wait a minute... wait a minute... we should be able to send a high- energy pulse through the tractor system... and if it's short enough, it shouldn't overload the emitters... the technology is right in here...
 GEORDI / If we could adapt those pulse- compression routines and apply them to the warp power conduits...
 GEORDI / Sure. With some modifications... (interrupting himself) Oh, this would be perfect...
 GEORDI / (not unfriendly) If the answer to all this is in a VISOR created for a blind man... who never would have existed in your society. No offense intended.
 TROI / It's hard to believe... so much loveliness here... just a few meters away from such desolation.
 TROI / This must sound incredibly simplistic... but can't you re-"engineer" all this on another planet...
 TROI / A nursery rhyme?
 TROI / Perhaps to prepare them for times like these.
 TROI / (whispers) I'm so sorry, Aaron. I wish I could do something to help.
 TROI / (smiles) No. A Counselor has to maintain a discreet distance... I'd rather think of us as friends.
 TROI / Aaron...
 TROI / Aaron, this is wrong...
 GEORDI / In order to move the core fragment to a safe trajectory, we needed our tractor beam to be able to handle high power pulses...
 GEORDI / About four times more efficient...
 GEORDI / So we added a little VISOR technology to the process and were able to boost the effective force... and at the same time, lower the power conduit stress levels...
 PICARD / What is the increase in efficiency?
 GEORDI / Up to almost three hundred percent...
 RIKER / That's not enough...
 GEORDI / (picking it up) ... But if we fortify the biosphere's structural integrity at the same time...
 GEORDI / We'll have to lend them some of our engineering support crews...
 PICARD / (to Hannah) Advise Mister Conor. Number One, brief the appropriate officers, prepare to transport them as soon as Conor approves...
 RIKER / Yessir...
 TROI / I'm still on Enterprise time.
 TROI / I'm going back to the ship, Aaron. I'm not going to see you again.
 TROI / Because it's the right thing to do.
 TROI / (angry, sad) You know it as well as I do.
 TROI / Yes. I'm angry. With myself. For allowing this to happen.
 TROI / I could fall in love with you, Aaron. So easily. But we both know the end of that story, don't we? How would Martin feel about introducing half-Betazoid DNA into the genetic balance?
 TROI / Listen to yourself. A few days ago, you didn't even want to talk to us. (beat) This is my fault. I'm so sorry, Aaron.
 TROI / I have to go...
 GEORDI / We'll have to bring down engineering crews from the Enterprise to work with your people for the next forty-eight hours...
 GEORDI / We've got to install five new shield generators and power supplies...
 GEORDI / Enterprise, you may begin transporting when ready...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45474.6. Gravitational effects are being felt on Moab Four as fortification efforts continue. Meanwhile, the Enterprise has moved to a parallel course with the core fragment. (more)
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) We must adjust its trajectory by a minimum of one-point-two degrees to insure the colony's safety.
 PICARD / Bring us within range of the fragment, Ensign...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / You may proceed, Commander La Forge.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. (to Hannah) Good luck.
 GEORDI / Engage tractor beam.
 GEORDI / Okay, let's give it a try. (working panels) Shutting down noncritical systems...
 DATA / Increasing impulse power to tractor emitters. E-P-S power levels rising...
 GEORDI / Transferring warp power to tractor beam generator...
 GEORDI / Bridge, we need more power...
 RIKER / Reduce life support to minimum requirements, Mister Data.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / Come on... come on...
 GEORDI / We've gotta increase the pulse frequency...
 GEORDI / We won't need them for long...
 GEORDI / All right. now we're getting there...
 DATA / We have lost one of the emitter circuits...
 WORF / Life support failure... decks nine, twelve, and thirteen...
 RIKER / Engage evacuation procedures for those decks. Geordi, I'm gonna need power back soon...
 GEORDI / Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / Not yet... hold on...
 DATA / We have lost the second lateral emitter circuit...
 WORF / Losing life-support systems on decks five through nine. Evacuation procedures initiated.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge...
 GEORDI / Hold on, Captain...
 DATA / Shipwide life-support failure in fifteen seconds...
 DATA / Termination of all life-support in five seconds...
 PICARD / Now, Mister La Forge...
 GEORDI / Yessir. (rapidly making adjustments) Shutting down all tractor emissions... transferring power back to life-support...
 WORF / Life-support normal on all decks... PICARD / Mister Data --
 DATA / The fragment's course has been altered, sir, by one-point-two-one degrees.
 PICARD / Hail the colony.
 PICARD / Success, Mister Conor. With the upgrades to your biosphere, the core fragment should no longer be a serious danger.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The stellar core fragment has passed safely out of the Moab system. The colony was shaken by powerful temblors but fortunately there were no injuries and only minor damage was reported.
 RIKER / (to com) Energize.
 RIKER / That should do it... all members of the Enterprise crew are accounted for, Mister Conor...
 RIKER / If there's nothing else, we'll be on our way...
 RIKER / (being polite) I'm sure she'll feel the same...
 GEORDI / Yeah, amazing...
 GEORDI / Why are you doing this?
 GEORDI / There's no breach...
 GEORDI / Hannah, my VISOR's positronic scan would have detected the leak... and its molecular pattern enhancer would have picked up even the smallest crack...
 GEORDI / (repeating) Why are you doing this... ?
 GEORDI / Maybe necessity really is the mother of invention. You don't always look for something until you need it.
 PICARD / Asylum?
 GEORDI / She wants to leave the colony.
 RIKER / She may not be the only one. (reactions) The science teams working on the surface... fielded a lot of questions from colonists who were more than curious about what's outside their world...
 WORF / Why shouldn't we grant them asylum?
 TROI / We can't do that.
 GEORDI / We have to do that.
 TROI / Do you understand what it would do to the colony?
 GEORDI / I understand these are Human beings, Counselor. With free will. If she wants to leave, she has a right to.
 RIKER / And what happens to the colony if she does? If others join her?
 BEVERLY / The society is genetically integrated. Suddenly, there would be gaps, missing pieces...
 TROI / It would destroy them.
 BEVERLY / There must be something we can do to help...
 PICARD / I think, Doctor, that we may have "helped" these people too much already...
 WORF / We did save them from destruction.
 PICARD / (beat, thoughtful) Did we?
 PICARD / Counselor, I think it is time you took me to meet Mister Conor.
 PICARD / Transporter room three.
 TROI / (to com) Computer, halt.
 TROI / Captain, I... have to tell you something... and it isn't easy for me... because I've used some very poor judgement... I've acted quite unprofessionally, actually...
 PICARD / Counselor... what is it you always say... ? "Take a deep breath"...
 TROI / (sighs) Conor and I have had a relationship.
 PICARD / I see.
 TROI / It should never have happened. I knew there was concern about outside influences. I should have been more careful.
 PICARD / Yes... I think we all should have been more careful. That's becoming more clear by the moment. (beat) What is your status with him presently?
 TROI / I did not intend to see him again.
 PICARD / Would you prefer not to return to the surface?
 TROI / I think I should come with you. But I wanted you to know before we went down.
 PICARD / I appreciate that.
 TROI / I wanted so much to help him, to be there for him... but the more I was...
 PICARD / Deanna, every one of us went into this with the best intentions...
 TROI / I should have walked away as soon as I saw what was happening...
 PICARD / And you didn't. And that's Human. We make mistakes. (not at all flip) Genetic manipulation or not -- nobody's perfect.
 TROI (o.c.) / Aaron...
 PICARD / Mister Conor, I believe you and I should talk.
 TROI / Hannah... let's allow Aaron and Captain Picard to discuss this. Why don't we take a walk...
 PICARD / You made decisions that you felt would save your colony.
 PICARD / We have both allowed this to happen, Conor.
 PICARD / I wish I could see a way.
 PICARD / If you force them to stay, you will be suppressing their Human rights.
 PICARD / That is simplistic.
 PICARD / I cannot ignore the requests of people, Humans who ask for transport away from here...
 PICARD / You would have me make the decision for you, Connor. But I cannot. I am willing to talk to these people with you. I will urge them not to make an impulsive choice. But if they finally choose to leave, the Enterprise cannot turn them away...
 PICARD / There is no question that our presence here has had an unintended influence on your society. That is done and there is no way to undo it now. But feelings are running high. Perhaps it's not such a bad idea to give yourselves adequate time to carefully weigh the consequences of what you are about to do. We are prepared to return in six months...
 PICARD / In five days, you have seen only the most superficial evidence of what life is like outside your biosphere...
 PICARD / What I would choose is not at issue...
 PICARD / Enterprise, two to beam up.
 TROI / Captain, may I have a moment...
 PICARD / (nods) Make that one, Enterprise.
 PICARD / Energize.
 TROI / What will you do now?
 TROI / Aaron, you acted in the best interests of your people... there was no way to avoid what happened...
 TROI / Don't say that, Aaron...
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / The colonists are all on board, sir.
 PICARD / How many finally?
 RIKER / Twenty-three.
 PICARD / If we ever needed a reminder of the importance of the Prime Directive, we have it now...
 RIKER / They're Human. The Prime Directive doesn't apply.
 PICARD / Doesn't it? Our very presence damaged, perhaps destroyed, a way of life. (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / (beat) Whether or not we agree with that way of life... whether or not they are Human... is ultimately irrelevant, Number One. We are responsible.
 RIKER / We had to respond to the threat from the core fragment... didn't we?
 PICARD / Yes. Of course we did. And I wish I could see any other course we could have taken. (beat) But I would submit, in the end, we proved ourselves just as dangerous to that colony as any stellar fragment could ever be.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45494.2. We are investigating a series of subspace signals that may indicate intelligent life in the Epsilon Silar System. We will be within sensor range in three hours...
 DATA and TROI are sitting at the bar, immersed in a / game of three-dimensional chess. Data is clearly winning. He moves a piece, then waits as Troi contemplates the board. Troi moves a piece. Data reacts, puzzled.
 DATA / The characteristic response to the Kriskov Gambit is to counter with an el-Mitra Exchange -- particularly since I have already taken both your rooks. By missing that opportunity, you have left your king vulnerable.
 TROI / We'll see...
 DATA / (shrugs) As you wish.
 DATA / (continuing) Check.
 DATA / Intriguing. You have devised a completely unanticipated response to a classic attack. (beat) You will checkmate my king in seven moves.
 TROI / Chess isn't just a game of gambits and ploys -- it's also a game of intuition.
 DATA / You are a challenging opponent.
 TROI / Thanks. But don't think a compliment's going to get you out of our bet. (beat) You owe me one Samarian Sunset. Served in the traditional style. As only you can make it, Data...
 DATA / I will honor our agreement.
 BEVERLY is running a medical scanner over the shoulder / and upper arm of a very athletic woman in her mid-twenties -- KRISTIN -- who is wearing a one-piece 24th-century SWIMSUIT, and sitting on a bio-bed. Kristin is gritting her teeth in obvious pain.
 BEVERLY / Raise your arm out to the side.
 BEVERLY / (re: the elevation) Is that it?
 BEVERLY / You can put your arm down now.
 BEVERLY / (lightly) I think it looks like you tucked when you should have flattened out.
 BEVERLY / Turn your head to the left.
 BEVERLY / Some tearing in the ligaments -- nothing we can't take care of.
 BEVERLY / If I remember correctly, the last time you graced my sickbay, you were diving off the "Cliffs of Heaven" on Cirrus Four. Holodeck program 47-C.
 BEVERLY / As your Doctor, I'd like to recommend the Emerald Wading Pool on Sumiko Three. It's a lot safer.
 RIKER / Navigators on this ship have been doing flight handling assessments the same way for years, Ensign...
 RIKER / (to com) Bridge. (beat) Do you mind if we discuss changes in procedure before you make them?
 RIKER / I would have said...
 RIKER / Or maybe "yes".
 RIKER / (continuing) The point is -- I never got that chance.
 RIKER / Ensign... the rules on this ship don't change because Ro Laren decides they do.
 PICARD and WORF are at their stations; GEORDI at an aft / console.
 WORF / (off console) We are picking up a subspace signal, Captain. Sensors show a small space craft ahead.
 GEORDI / The configuration is unfamiliar -- nothing in our database comes close.
 WORF / Within visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Analysis, Mister Worf.
 WORF / No discernable armament. Reading one life-form aboard.
 PICARD / Hail the vessel.
 WORF / No response, Captain.
 GEORDI / (off console) We're being scanned... but it's not like any sensor system I've ever seen... Should we raise shields?
 PICARD / No. We'll start this off with a show of good faith.
 WORF / Sir, the scans are now matching the frequencies of our optical data network. (MORE)
 WORF (cont'd) / (looks up) It could be an attempt to access our computer system.
 GEORDI / Scanning intensity has increased by fifteen hundred percent.
 PICARD / Shields up.
 DATA / (re: drink) One Samarian Sunset, served in the traditional style.
 TROI / It's beautiful.
 DATA / I hope you enjoy it.
 DATA / (continuing) I hope you enjoy it.
 WORF / The scanning signal has penetrated our shields...
 GEORDI / Our computers are going down!
 PICARD / Take evasive action --
 PICARD / What happened?
 GEORDI / What the hell...
 RIKER / I don't know who any of you are.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Neither do I... I don't even remember who I am...
 GEORDI / It looks like we're all in the same boat.
 RIKER / (re: viewscreen) Make that -- "on the same starship."
 PICARD / But you still know how to work it.
 RIKER / This console has a tactical configuration.
 WORF / (nodding) Phaser power status, intruder scan, torpedo guidance...
 WORF / (continuing) They do not appear to be operable.
 PICARD / Clearly, we still possess certain skills -- we seem to know how to operate this vessel. But our identities have somehow been erased, or suppressed.
 RIKER / We are on the bridge -- there's a good chance this is our ship.
 RIKER / (continuing; to Picard) And it looks like you're the leader.
 WORF / We should not jump to conclusions. (indicating own sash) I am... decorated as well.
 PICARD / Determining our command structure isn't crucial right now. Finding out who we are, and what we're doing out here is.
 GEORDI / More like -- who did this to us?
 GEORDI / (indicating monitor) I've got some intermittent sensor readings here... the scan keeps repeating itself -- like it's stuck. But it looks like there's metallic debris right in front of us. Distance: seventeen kilometers.
 RIKER / The remains of another ship?
 GEORDI / That's a good possibility.
 WORF / Perhaps we were engaged in battle.
 PICARD / If this presumption is correct, we may have sustained other damage. (to COM) Computer... status report.
 RIKER / No voice interface...
 GEORDI / No interface, period.
 GEORDI / Hey -- got something.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I've accessed the basic system directories.
 PICARD / Can you give us a general status report?
 GEORDI / (nodding) ... Life-support systems are fully operational throughout the ship. Navigation and propulsion... Off line.
 GEORDI / Completely disrupted.
 RIKER / If we even knew where to send it.
 PICARD / Do we have an onboard communication system?
 GEORDI / We do now.
 PICARD / I suggest we use it. Our ship must have a crew. They may still have their memories.
 WORF / (to com) Bridge to all personnel. Select a representative from your group to contact the bridge and report on your status.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / (continuing) Remain where you are. Stay calm. Bridge out.
 BEVERLY / Report on our "status"? I wonder if every one else is in the same condition we are.
 BEVERLY / I didn't even think -- I just knew how to use it.
 BEVERLY / At least I've got an idea of what I'm doing here.
 BEVERLY / (gently) No, it doesn't.
 WORF / Yes?
 WORF / I have completed a survey of our tactical systems. We are equipped with ten phaser banks, two hundred seventy five photon torpedoes, and a high capacity shield grid.
 WORF / It appears so...
 RIKER / That sounds like the next logical step... we should start with the most crucial area first...
 RIKER / Hey, hold on, we've gotta coordinate our efforts here...
 RIKER / Look, I feel the same way... we all do... but if anything's gonna get done here...
 RIKER / Well, we're all gonna have to depend on each other to get through this, okay?
 RIKER / We're going to search the ship.
 WORF / Very well. Proceed.
 GEORDI / I'll go with you. I want to get my hands on the computer core. See if we can reestablish control from there.
 GEORDI / I've accessed the optical data network for the engineering core. I can monitor every system that's routed through here.
 GEORDI / Everything looks functional... now if we could just access the control systems we could get them up and running.
 RIKER / According to the schematics, the engineering computer core access is down that corridor.
 GEORDI / (nodding) That's where I'll start.
 RIKER / (to Ro) Let's begin our crew survey on decks five through ten.
 RIKER / Alright. (to Geordi) Good luck.
 GEORDI / You too.
 RIKER / When you've got those systems going, try for the personnel files. It would be nice if we all had names...
 PICARD / So far, our survey team has found no deaths or injuries among the crew. The shuttlecraft are operational, as are the transporters.
 WORF / Engineering is working on accessing the control systems. As soon as the ship is operational, we must make it combat-ready.
 PICARD / I would recommend that before we prepare for combat, we try to access the ship's logs. Discover who we are and what our purpose here might be.
 WORF / I disagree. We must first make ourselves ready for battle. That is the highest priority.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Engineering to the bridge.
 WORF / Go ahead, engineering.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I've regained control of propulsion, navigation, weapons, and communications. We'll be able to tie them into the bridge in just a few minutes.
 WORF / Well done.
 WORF / We are ready.
 PICARD / The question is -- for what?
 WORF / We now have full tactical control.
 PICARD / We should run a complete diagnostic of all command systems.
 WORF / A full diagnostic would require us to take our systems off-line. We would be defenseless.
 PICARD / If we're going to trust our lives to these systems, we should make certain they aren't going to fail.
 WORF / Proceed with the diagnostic.
 WORF / What have you found, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Not much. The brain scans I've run are unusual, but they show no damage to the hippocampus. That suggests we still have our long-term memories... but somehow they're being blocked.
 PICARD / Is it possible to bypass the normal pathways? To get at those memories in some other way?
 BEVERLY / That's what I'm hoping. What I need now is to see some normal brain scans for comparison. Is there any chance I could get the crew's medical files?
 WORF / We are currently running a full diagnostic. Computer resources are limited.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) The medical records will be our next priority.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 CREWMAN / I guess these are my quarters. But I don't remember anything.
 RIKER / If it's any comfort, everybody's in the same situation. Stay put for now... we'll be back in touch.
 CREWMAN / Okay, sir. Thanks.
 RIKER / (checking his padd) There's a large room up ahead. On the diagram, it's called "Ten Forward."
 RIKER / Having a lot more fun than searching the ship, I'd imagine.
 RIKER / With that holodeck we just saw, I bet I could conjure up an interesting program or two...
 RIKER / Why?
 RIKER / (to the group) Who reported to the bridge from this group?
 TROI / I did.
 RIKER / Have you found anything that might give us some insight into what happened?
 TROI / Not specifically. But there are two things that seem unusual...
 TROI / The bartender is an artificial lifeform.
 DATA / (to Riker and Ro) Is there something I could get you? A beverage of your choice?
 RIKER / No, thank you.
 RIKER / Your memories are gone as well?
 DATA / The databanks that would identify who I am are not functioning.
 RIKER / You were going to mention something else?
 TROI / (nodding) I don't know if this means anything... but I seem to have an ability that the others don't. I have a very strong sense of what people are feeling... at times it's almost --
 RIKER / Is something wrong?
 TROI / No... it's just... for a moment... you seemed familiar.
 RIKER / You remember me?
 TROI / Not exactly... I mean, I don't know who you are... but there's something about you...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to survey team.
 RIKER / (to com) Survey team here.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We have accessed the personnel files. Report to the bridge immediately.
 GEORDI / Computer -- give me a biographical listing of all personnel responsible for primary operation of the ship.
 GEORDI / Is there any list of the ship's senior officers?
 GEORDI / That's better than nothing. Give me the crew manifest.
 PICARD / Commander MacDuff... Please see to it that all other officers who were listed report to the bridge.
 PICARD / Your next priority is to retrieve any information you can regarding this ship's mission.
 PICARD / Contact the operations officer to assist you.
 WORF / I regret my recent behavior. I assumed an attitude of authority that was... unwarranted.
 PICARD / We're all doing the best we can in a difficult situation. Think nothing more of it.
 WORF / Thank you... Captain.
 GEORDI / We haven't finished a full search of the computer records. But we've found out quite a bit.
 DATA / This vessel is named the Enterprise. We are part of an organization called the United Federation of Planets. The Federation is currently in a state of war.
 TROI / (disturbed) With whom?
 GEORDI / The Lysian Alliance. They're a genocidal race determined to destroy us. The war's been going on for years.
 DATA / Starfleet Command believes the Lysians have a new weapon that has shifted the balance of power in their favor.
 GEORDI / Over the last two months, fourteen Federation ships have been captured -- apparently very easily -- and the crews imprisoned on Lysia.
 PICARD / What do we know about this weapon?
 DATA / Our scientists theorize that the Lysians are using an energy wave -- either plasma based or a subspace interference pattern. The weapon severly disrupts a starship's computer systems and the mental functioning of the crew.
 PICARD / Commander, is there any record of our current mission?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / We're approximately here... (points) We've been ordered to cross into Lysian territory... (pointing) ... and destroy their Central Command.
 GEORDI / This is it -- the nerve-center of the Lysian military operation.
 TROI / Captain, there's been a great deal of damage to our computer system. Maybe we're not getting accurate information.
 PICARD / What are you suggesting?
 TROI / That we get confirmation of this mission from our headquarters.
 WORF / If we use subspace radio we will be detected --
 TROI / But there may be thousands of lives at stake --
 GEORDI / Our orders specifically require us to maintain radio silence.
 DATA / Our mission is part of a highly coordinated effort to put an end to the war. There are other vessels on other fronts, all working according to an intricate plan.
 GEORDI / We're the lynch pin to the operation. If we don't destroy the Central Command -- the entire effort will fail.
 WORF / Captain, our choice is clear.
 PICARD / Commander MacDuff -- set a course for the Lysian Central Command.
 RIKER / These are your quarters.
 TROI / Thanks for the help.
 TROI / (continuing) Come in for a minute.
 RIKER / Recognize anything?
 TROI / (re: room) It might as well belong to someone else.
 TROI / Nothing feels right... this room, the ship... most of all this war we're fighting...
 RIKER / I don't imagine war ever feels right.
 TROI / I suppose that's true...
 RIKER / What is it?
 TROI / That same feeling... you seem familiar... you're the only thing that does.
 RIKER / Can you remember anything specific?
 TROI / I don't know...
 TROI / It's more like remembering an emotional image... feelings that are somehow associated with you...
 RIKER / I hope they're good feelings...
 TROI / Yes... they are...
 TROI / This entire situation is... a little unnerving...
 RIKER / (giving her the out) It's been a long day. We've all been through a lot.
 TROI / Yes. We certainly have.
 RIKER / I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.
 RIKER / (indicates PADD) I know I didn't get the wrong room.
 RIKER / Really?
 RIKER / For all we know, you and I could hate each other.
 RIKER / We might regret this.
 RIKER / Maybe we should switch quarters.
 RIKER / What if I snore in my sleep?
 WORF / Captain, we have crossed the Lysian border.
 PICARD / Ensign, take us out of warp. Three-quarters impulse.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, maintain a continuous sensor sweep.
 WORF / Aye, Captain.
 DATA / At our current speed, approximately thirty-seven hours.
 WORF / Captain, I am picking up a vessel directly ahead.
 PICARD / Can you identify?
 DATA / (working console) The ship matches the Starfleet description of a Lysian Destroyer. A short-range attack vessel... with disruptor-style weapons, and a standard crew of fifty-three.
 WORF / Within visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / (off instruments) The destroyer is increasing its speed. (glances up) They are moving to intercept.
 PICARD / (to Ro) Evasive maneuver sequence delta.
 WORF / They are matching our manuevers...
 PICARD / (gesturing to hold up) Stand by.
 PICARD / I'm aware of that, Commander. (to Data) Tactical analysis, Mister Data.
 DATA / (off instruments) The destroyer has minimal shields. Their disruptor capacity appears to be only two point one megajoules.
 RIKER / They're no match for the Enterprise.
 DATA / Captain -- the destroyer is hailing us.
 PICARD / Open a channel --
 DATA / It is conceivable, sir.
 TROI / It's also possible that they simply want to talk to us. I think we should respond.
 WORF / They are hailing us again.
 DATA / Captain, The Lysians have stopped transmitting. They are powering up their disruptors. (beat) They have locked onto us, sir...
 RIKER / Full shields.
 WORF / Shields up.
 PICARD / (grimly) Return fire.
 WORF / The ship has been destroyed.
 PICARD / Maintain our course, Ensign. Increase to three quarters impulse.
 WORF / The Lysian Central Command would have received any transmission from the destroyer by now.
 PICARD / (nods) Agreed.
 PICARD / Doctor, the success of this mission would be far more likely if we had our memories back. Is there anything you can do?
 BEVERLY / I found several cases resembling our condition in the medical index. The causes are different, but the cure is similar in each case.
 RIKER / Could the same treatment work for us?
 BEVERLY / (nods) That's my hope. It involves increasing the activity of the medial temporal region of the brain. Using short term memory synapses to retrieve long term memory.
 PICARD / When can you start?
 BEVERLY / As soon as our medical records become available. It would be too dangerous to attempt treatment without them.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / Data and I ran into some trouble accessing the medical file areas in the computer. But with a little time, I'm pretty sure we can get there. (shrugs) Three hours, maximum.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) I'm still hitting a file wall... I don't get it.
 DATA / There appears to be a command path discontinuity. I shall attempt to rewrite the locator subroutine.
 GEORDI / (joking re: speed) You must have been one hell of a bartender.
 GEORDI / It's too bad there aren't any more of you around. We could certainly use the help.
 DATA / Yes.
 GEORDI / I wonder why you're the only one on board?
 DATA / I have expended a great deal of thought with respect to my apparent uniqueness among the crew.
 GEORDI / Any conclusions?
 DATA / Several possibilities suggest themselves. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / I may represent an entire race of artificial lifeforms. If so, there may be a home planet for others of my kind -- a shared history and a culture of which I am not presently aware.
 GEORDI / Then again, you could've been built just for this ship.
 DATA / I have considered that possibility as well. It may also be the case that every starship in the Federation is equipped with an artificial lifeform such as myself.
 GEORDI / (nodding) It that's true, you might all even look alike. A standard issue android. Hard to construct -- so only one allowed per vessel. (smiles) Maybe you all get together for android holidays...
 DATA / There is another possibility. Perhaps my origin was unique. In that case... I am alone.
 DATA / We have accessed the information storage area. But considerable damage has been done to the files themselves.
 GEORDI / The mission reports are gone.
 DATA / (works console) As are the crew records, and the personal logs.
 GEORDI / So are the medical records.
 RIKER / Come in.
 TROI / I'm restless. Mind if I visit for a while?
 RIKER / Please...
 RIKER / (continuing) What's wrong?
 TROI / Everything. Everytime I think about this war, our mission... I feel a sense of panic. Like a hand is closing around my throat.
 RIKER / You're never gonna feel good about this war. None of us will. But we've got to finish our mission.
 RIKER / (continuing) I've been doing a little research. Learning about someone named William Riker.
 TROI / (smiles) And what have you discovered?
 RIKER / He's a musician, for one thing.
 TROI / Very impressive.
 RIKER / Nobody could have been more surprised than me.
 TROI / (playfully) What else has your research uncovered about William Riker?
 RIKER / Let's see... He's athletically inclined... loves to mountain climb. He was born in a place called Alaska. He likes exotic foods... spends his vacation time on a planet called Risa...
 TROI / (reads) "Ode to Psyche." John Keats.
 RIKER / Open it.
 TROI / (reads) "To Will... All My Love, Deanna."
 RIKER / (re: book) It could explain the familiar feeling you have...
 TROI / I... don't know what to think.
 RIKER / Come in.
 TROI / (nodding) Ensign.
 TROI / (to Ro) I was just visiting. (to Riker, more formal) We'll talk again soon, Commander.
 RIKER / Of course. Thank you, Counselor.
 RIKER / (shrugs) Just talking about the situation we're all in...
 GEORDI / What bothers me, Captain, is how specific the damage is. Any records of a personal nature, any files that could tell us more about who we are -- those are the ones that are gone.
 RIKER / That's a little too selective for coincidence.
 BEVERLY / As selective as what was done to our own memories. Our skills still in place -- but personal knowledge unavailable.
 PICARD / Doctor, is it absolutely necessary for you to see the medical files before you attempt a treatment?
 BEVERLY / No. But it would be dangerous without them.
 RIKER / (volunteering) I think that's a risk we have to take --
 BEVERLY / That's strange. The diencephalic activity is exactly the same. There should be some increase. (to Nurse) Let's try broadening the band width.
 BEVERLY / (continuing; to nurse) Go to thirty point one.
 BEVERLY / (to nurse) Raise the frequency as well. Increase by thirty-three percent...
 BEVERLY / Something's wrong with the sequencing program!
 BEVERLY / (insistent) Kieran. Kieran.
 BEVERLY / I don't know. Something went wrong with the sequence initiator. We're lucky we didn't lose you. (beat) Did any of this work? Do you remember anything about yourself?
 BEVERLY / It's back to square one.
 PICARD / Enter.
 PICARD / Yes, Commander. Sit down.
 PICARD / I find myself with grave concerns about our mission.
 PICARD / No. I have more fundamental doubts... (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / (beat) Whether or not this mission is justified.
 PICARD / Orders which we cannot even verify.
 PICARD / But I also can't ignore the fact that we greatly outclassed the only enemy vessel we've encountered. And that every possible shred of information which could shed some light on our situation has been conveniently eliminated.
 PICARD / I feel as though I've been handed a weapon, pushed into a room and told to shoot a stranger.
 PICARD / I need a moral context to justify that action. And I don't have one. I'm not satisfied simply following orders. I want to know that what I am doing is right.
 DATA / (off instruments) Captain, we are approaching the Lysian system.
 PICARD / Decrease to one quarter impulse.
 PICARD / Red Alert. Battle stations. Bring us to attack posture, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Aye, Captain.
 DATA / Sensors show several objects in our path. They are twenty-nine meters in length and are unmanned.
 RIKER / (off instruments) I'm reading forty-seven of them around the perimeter.
 PICARD / Tactical analysis, Mister Data.
 DATA / (working console) The pods are equipped with fusion generated pulse lasers, and minimal shielding.
 RIKER / Not much power there...
 PICARD / Forward shields on maximum. Lock phasers on the sentry pods and prepare to return fire.
 WORF / Shields up, phasers locked on targets.
 PICARD / Full impulse. Take us straight through them.
 DATA / We are through the perimeter.
 RIKER / This is too easy.
 WORF / We have yet to encounter any battleships. They may lie ahead.
 PICARD / Load all torpedo bays. Ready phasers.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Approaching the Central Command...
 PICARD / Mister Data, scan for defenses.
 DATA / I am picking up no vessels -- and no additional sentry pods.
 WORF / The station is in visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / (off console) Optimal firing range in fifty-five seconds.
 PICARD / What are the defensive capabilities of the Central Command?
 DATA / Armaments consist of four laser cannons and thirty-nine cobalt fusion warheads with magnetic propulsion. Defensive shield output is only... four point three kilojoules.
 RIKER / (amazed) One photon torpedo ought to do it.
 TROI / Data... how many people are on that station?
 DATA / (off instruments) Fifteen thousand, three hundred eleven.
 PICARD / (gesturing to hold up) Stand by.
 TROI / Captain, this isn't right...
 RIKER / How can our mortal enemy be over a hundred years behind us in weapons technology?
 PICARD / I do not fire on defenseless people.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... open a channel to the Lysians.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. We are on a course to Starbase Three- zero-one. Doctor Crusher has been working steadily, and has restored the memories of most of the crew.
 PICARD / The Lysians have identified "Commander MacDuff" as a Satarran -- an alien race that's been at war with the Lysians for decades.
 PICARD / I've conveyed to the Lysians our deepest regrets over the tragedy of their lost ship and crew. They've been extraordinarily understanding.
 RIKER / With all the power that MacDuff had... to alter our brain chemistry, and manipulate the computers... it's hard to believe he needed the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Satarran weapons technology is no more advanced than the Lysians'. One photon torpedo would have ended their war.
 RIKER / It almost did...
 RIKER / I hope I'm not interrupting.
 TROI / Please -- sit down.
 RIKER / Well. I'm glad I ran into the two of you...
 RIKER / You know, when you have no memory of who you are, or who anybody else is...
 RIKER / (taken aback) She said that?
 TROI / It's psychologically valid.
 RIKER / (re: Ro) I feel kind of... confused.
 TROI / If you still feel confused tomorrow -- you know where my office is.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45571.2. We are going into orbit around an unexplored M-class moon of Mab-Bu Six. Though the moon was reported to be uninhabited, we have picked up a weak distress call.
 DATA / The intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on the moon's surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of the signal, sir...
 PICARD / Any indications of life, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Scanners read negative, sir. But they may be affected by the interference.
 RIKER / Have you ever heard anything like that, Data?
 DATA / (curious) I believe so, Commander... at Starfleet Academy...
 PICARD / The Academy?
 DATA / Yes, sir, let me verify it...
 DATA / (continuing) As I thought, sir... it is a Starfleet subspace distress signal... standard to Daedalus class starships...
 RIKER / (reacts, to Picard) There hasn't been a Daedalus class in service for... what... ?
 DATA / One hundred seventy-two years, Commander...
 PICARD / Any record of missing ships in this vicinity, Data?
 DATA / The U.S.S. Essex under the command of Captain Bryce Shumar disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago...
 PICARD / Daedalus class...
 DATA / (checking) Yes, Captain... I have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the Essex... it is identical to the signal coming from the moon's surface...
 RIKER / We've arrived a little late...
 PICARD (o.c.) / Mute it, Data.
 PICARD / (to Riker) With the storm activity down there, I don't think it's worth the risk to check on a ghost ship, Number One... advise Starfleet we've solved the mystery of Captain Shumar and the Essex...
 TROI / I'm not sure we have...
 TROI / Someone's down there... alive...
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, supplemental. The electromagnetic interference on the surface was judged too dangerous for anyone to transport down. So we have taken a shuttle to investigate.
 DATA / Shields are holding...
 RIKER / (checking instruments) Wind shear is incredible, Data... keep an eye on the stabilizers... (glances at Troi) If it's anything like this on the ground, I don't see how anyone could survive on this moon for long.
 TROI / Maybe they've been living underground.
 RIKER / (off console) Question is where? I still can't locate the source of the damn signal... it's bouncing around more than we are...
 DATA / Sir, forward thrusters have failed. We are losing power.
 RIKER / Enterprise... ?
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 RIKER'S COMM VOICE / We've lost our thrusters... attempting to compensate with secondary boosters...
 WORF / Sir? The shuttle's impulse generators have shut down...
 PICARD / Commander? Can you hear me?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (completely fritzed) Enterprise to shuttle, please respond.
 RIKER / Hold on! We're going down...
 DATA / Initiating emergency landing procedures...
 RIKER / Maintain the approach attitude Data... I'm taking her in...
 PICARD / Do you have their position?
 WORF / (off console) I am picking up the shuttle's trace signature... but the surface interference is distorting its position...
 PICARD / (urgent) Can you locate them...
 RIKER / (taps communicator) Enterprise?
 DATA / It is unlikely, sir, that we will be able to establish communication with the ship, given the severe electromagnetic interference...
 RIKER / (in pain) Then we'll stay put right here until the Enterprise finds us... (looks around) Data, run an inventory of what's still usable inside the shuttle.
 DATA / Yes sir.
 TROI / Your arm...
 RIKER / Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's broken...
 RIKER / The surface is composed of nonporous rock... makes me think it's even more unlikely anyone could live here...
 DATA / There are no instruments left of practical value that have not been damaged by the impact of our landing.
 TROI / (points to horizon) What is that?
 RIKER / Doesn't look like any storm front I've ever seen...
 DATA / (checking with the tricorder) The tricorder is picking up high levels of E-M bursts across the spectrum.
 RIKER / Are you picking up anything else, Data... like signs of life... ?
 DATA / Other than our own, sir... negative.
 TROI / There is someone alive here... I'm more certain of it now than ever...
 RIKER / Well, I hope they can find us... because we don't have a way to find them...
 TROI / (realizing) They're coming... they're coming with the storm...
 GEORDI / We can't get a pattern lock on the communicators because of the E-M bursts, Captain. There's no way to beam them out of there... not under these conditions...
 PICARD / The same conditions won't permit a shuttle to land safely, Mister LaForge... any suggestions... ?
 GEORDI / Chief, there's no guarantee you won't rematerialize in a million pieces if your signal gets caught up in that electromagnetic whirlwind...
 GEORDI / (beat, to com) Captain, Chief O'Brien wants to beam down to the surface with a pattern enhancer...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / (continuing) His chances of getting down there safely are no better than fifty- fifty in my judgement...
 WORF / Captain, a major storm front is moving in on the away team's coordinates...
 PICARD / (beat) Mister O'Brien... you are aware of the risks?
 PICARD COM VOICE / Prepare to transport.
 RIKER / Glad you could join us.
 RIKER / Storm front going to affect the transport, Chief... ?
 RIKER / I'm with you...
 RIKER / Lunch time, O'Brien! Let's do it!
 TIGHT on Troi, eyes closed, unconscious. WIDEN to BEVERLY who scans Troi on a table with a medical / tricorder. A quiet moment goes by... Then without warning, Troi's EYES JERK OPEN and she BOLTS UPRIGHT, knocking aside equipment -- crying out in terror, as if awakened from a nightmare. Beverly's startled, and grasps Troi by the arms to keep her from struggling.
 BEVERLY / Easy, Deanna...
 TROI / W-where... ?
 BEVERLY / You're back on the Enterprise... Everything's okay now.
 TROI / But my skin... It's tingling.
 BEVERLY / You are experiencing some afterimages from the electromagnetic discharge. The sensation will pass. Try to relax...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) They're all fine, too. Now take your time, Counselor, okay? Doctor's orders.
 PICARD / (casual) Injury report, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Mostly minor abrasions. But Commander Riker took the worst of it with a broken arm... The biofilter scans showed their nervous systems were generating unusally high levels of synaptic energy. I don't think it's anything to worry about...
 PICARD / Good work, Mister O'Brien.
 RIKER / Ready for duty, Captain.
 PICARD / Are you sure, Number One?
 RIKER / (nods, flexes his injured arm) It's not the first bone I've broken.
 PICARD / And how are you, Counselor?
 TROI / Very glad to be here.
 PICARD / (to Riker) What happened down there?
 RIKER / It was just one hell of a storm... moved in on our position faster than anything I've ever seen.
 PICARD / Did you find any evidence of life?
 RIKER / No, but if Troi was right, we weren't far away from it...
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge. (beat) How do you suggest we proceed?
 RIKER / We're gonna have to find a way to modify the scanners to penetrate those storms. Got any ideas, Data... ?
 DATA / (a beat) It is p-p-possible we might be able to employ virtual imaging to interpolate missing data...
 PICARD / Is there something wrong, Data?
 DATA / My apologies. It seems my primary speech processors are experiencing a minor fluctuation. I will have it corrected in a... m-m-moment.
 TROI / Captain... may I speak with you a moment? In private?
 PICARD / Of course, Counselor. (to Riker) Take the bridge, Number One.
 RIKER / Mister Data, deploy sensor scans when you're ready. Ensign, move into a synchronous orbit aligned with our crash site.
 DATA / Sir? Given the E-M field properties of this moon, I would recommend a search pattern beginning at the southern p-p-polar region.
 RIKER / (reacts) The polar region... But that's starting from scratch, Data. The last reading we had on the Essex would suggest we begin the scans near our crash site...
 DATA / The Essex signal was never clearly located, sir. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / A broader, systematic survey of the moon from a p-p-polar orbit might be more practical.
 RIKER / (considers a beat) Well, you might be right. Still, I'd like to give the crash site a once-over first... We'll maintain our present orbit for now.
 DATA / Understood, sir.
 TROI / I've never felt anything quite like it... It was almost as though they were calling to me...
 PICARD / (reacts) Are you saying someone was communicating telepathically, Counselor?
 TROI / Perhaps. For an instant. It was like their voices were carried on the wind.
 PICARD / What were they trying to communicate?
 TROI / I'm not sure... but they were calling me to the southern polar region... I believe that's where we should look for the Essex...
 RIKER / Override them?
 RIKER / Mister Data, do you know anything about this?
 RIKER / (continuing) Data... ?
 RIKER / (continuing) Security to the bridge!
 RIKER / (continuing) Computer, transfer command to engineering... Full security alert!
 TROI / What happened?
 DATA / He would not move to a polar orbit.
 TROI / (angry at Data) You could not wait? The captain would have done it for me...
 RIKER / (quick) Computer, reenable bridge control. Authorization: Riker-Omega-Three...
 PICARD / Report...
 RIKER / They're in turbolift four.
 WORF / Engaging turbolift override controls, now...
 DATA / They have t-t-trapped us... what will we do?
 TROI / What deck is this?
 TROI / Can you move us again?
 RIKER / Activate all security fields on decks eight through fifteen...
 WORF / (off console) Sir? The turbolift is moving again. They're still inside.
 PICARD / Initiate emergency bulkheads in turboshaft four...
 WORF / Aye, sir. (off console) They've been stopped at deck thirteen.
 PICARD / (nods the order) Mister Worf...
 TROI / (to O'Brien) Do you know how to deactivate this?
 DATA / My entity's artificial substructure may be useful...
 RIKER / They've broken through a security field, deck ten, section two...
 PICARD / (reacts) Security to Ten Forward...
 TROI / Everyone get down on the floor!
 WORF / Everyone down! Now!!
 RIKER / (off console) Multiple phaser shots in Ten Forward.
 PICARD / Picard to Worf -- report.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Mister Worf... acknowledge.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Can you hear me, Lieutenant Worf?
 TROI / Yes, bridge. He can hear you.
 RIKER / Position security teams at both entrances...
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, shut down all computer access in Ten Forward...
 GEORDI / (reacts to console) I can't, Captain. They've already set up a remote security lock-out... We'd have to shut down all computer functions in the saucer section...
 RIKER / (to com) Transporter room three, can you get a pattern lock on Commander Data, Counselor Troi and Chief O'Brien in Ten Forward... ?
 PICARD / How many people are down there?
 PICARD / (to com) Doctor Crusher to the bridge...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / On my way.
 TROI / What are you doing now?
 DATA / I can reverse the p-polarity of their forcefields to isolate this room.
 TROI / Good.
 RIKER / Geordi?
 GEORDI / I don't recognize the configurations... (off console) But they've completely isolated Ten Forward.
 RIKER / How about flooding their air vents with anesthizine gas?
 GEORDI / That won't affect Data. No rescue plan will work if we don't knock out all three of them.
 RIKER / A concussive charge would blow out the security field. Then we could go in with phasers on wide beam. Stun everybody. Sort it out later...
 PICARD / Doctor, go back to the biofilter readouts taken during the away team's transport from the moon's surface... see if you can come up with any kind of clue that might explain this...
 PICARD / (to com) Ten Forward, this is Captain Picard. I am prepared to discuss this situation. There is no need for further violence...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (continuing) Please identify yourself.
 TROI / (to O'Brien) They will now attempt to negotiate for the safety and release of their people. (beat, realizing) Interesting. Under normal circumstances, I would be counseling the captain at a time like this...
 TROI / I would help him find a way to secure our trust.
 DATA / W-what are you looking at?
 DATA / I am speaking to you, Klingon.
 DATA / (taunting) Attack me. Or are you afraid?
 WORF / I have no fear of death.
 DATA / And I have no fear of killing you...
 TROI / Stop it.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Please respond, Ten Forward. Are there any members of my crew who require medical assistance?
 TROI / We can discuss your wounded, Captain. But first, you will move the ship.
 PICARD / Move it where?
 TROI'S COM VOICE / You will will change the ship's orbit to an inclination of eighty degrees, south.
 RIKER / (to Picard) The southern polar region -- that's where Data tried to move the ship.
 PICARD / And exactly what Troi asked me to do, but why? (beat) Ten Forward -- if you could be more specific about our intended destination, perhaps we could...
 TROI'S COM VOICE / (interrupting) You have thirty seconds to change your heading -- or additional members of your crew will "require medical attention."
 PICARD / (to Riker et al) We need to stabilize this situation and play for time. I suggest we move the ship as they have asked. Agreed?
 PICARD / (to conn officer) Set the new heading. But take us there as slowly as you can... (nods to Ro to resume com) Ten Forward, we are moving the ship as you requested.
 DATA / He's telling the truth... their heading has changed...
 BEVERLY / I've compared the away team's last transport trace patterns to earlier records. They're exactly the same, except in Troi, Data and O'Brien there's an unusual synaptic activity -- some kind of anionic energy. It may be a life-form superimposing neural patterns onto our people.
 RIKER / Why wasn't I affected?
 BEVERLY / I don't know. But one difference between you and the others was that you were injured.
 RIKER / My broken arm...
 BEVERLY / (nods) The fracture caused pain receptors to fire which may have made you immune... to this energy.
 PICARD / If your theory is accurate, what would happen if we inflicted pain on the others...
 BEVERLY / That might force whatever it is out of our people.
 GEORDI / (acknowledges) I could hook up a modified laser scanner to a plasma invertor...
 RIKER / What about Data?
 GEORDI / A plasma shock would certainly overload his neural net. It might work for him too...
 RIKER / We'd have to find a way to penetrate the forcefield around Ten Forward.
 GEORDI / I might be able to interrupt the forcefield for a few seconds... but I'll be fighting the computer for control... timing would be critical...
 PICARD / (to Geordi) How would you gain access?
 GEORDI / We could use a micro-optic drill through the ceiling and they'd never detect it...
 BEVERLY / If this is going to work, we need some way to contain that anionic energy after we get it out of our people.
 PICARD / Yes, Doctor... that will be your top priority. (beat) Very well. Proceed.
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge to Ten Forward. Now that we are moving the ship as you requested, I would like to know the nature of the injuries to members of my crew.
 TROI / Five of your people have been injured.
 PICARD / How serious is their condition?
 TROI / (to Worf) You tell him, Klingon.
 WORF / Captain. One person has suffered what looks like a level five phaser hit...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / And four others have secondary burns. They require medical attention...
 WORF / (continuing) And our captors are not affected by phaser stun settings...
 DATA / Silence, Klingon.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Ten Forward -- those people must be released so they can receive proper medical treatment.
 TROI / I will release no one.
 PICARD / If you release the wounded... (beat) I will take their place.
 DATA / It may be a... d-deception.
 TROI / (thoughtful beat) The crew values Picard's life above all others... (to bridge) Captain Picard. We agree to your proposal.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Expect a medical team to accompany me.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to sickbay. Send an emergency medical team to meet me outside Ten Forward.
 RIKER / Sir, putting you down there just strengthens their position.
 PICARD / As long as they're on board, I'm a hostage no matter where I am. We all are. I must find out who we are dealing with...
 PICARD / If La Forge and Ro can attempt a rescue in short order, proceed with it. If they can't... I'll provide you with another opportunity. Watch for it.
 RIKER / Yes, sir...
 DATA / Silence that... ch-child!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Ten Forward, we are outside the door.
 TROI / (to O'Brien) Lower the force field.
 TROI / Welcome, Captain. Allow me to introduce myself...
 TROI / I am Captain Bryce Shumar, of the Federation Starship Essex.
 PICARD / (measured) The Starship Essex vanished over two hundred years ago...
 TROI / Indeed. I know. I was there.
 TROI / (re: Data) This is my First Officer... Commander Steven Mullen. (re: O'Brien) And my Security Chief... Lieutenant Morgan Kelly.
 PICARD / You're telling me that you've survived this long as... (searching for the right  word)
 TROI / Spirits? Ghosts? But you are a man who would never believe in ghosts, Picard. Isn't that true?
 TROI / You see, I know you. Troi knows you. And so I do, as well.
 PICARD / Then Counselor Troi is still... alive?
 TROI / Yes, of course she is, and I have no wish to harm her. Or to harm anyone else.
 PICARD / I'm pleased to hear that.
 TROI / We have been forced to take this action because we need your help, Captain.
 PICARD / My help... ?
 TROI / Our consciousness has been trapped on this moon for two centuries... we must escape this torture...
 PICARD / How did this happen to you?
 TROI / I cannot explain how it occurred, only that it did. (beat) The Essex was caught in an electromagnetic storm just as your shuttle was. Moments before we crashed, the bridge was struck by lightning. The ship was ripped apart. Somehow, in that instant, our consciousness was absorbed in the magnetic currents on the surface.
 PICARD / Why didn't you tell us this? Why the deception, the violence?
 TROI / As I said, Captain. I knew you wouldn't believe us. Even now, I'm sure you do not.
 PICARD / (beat) What was your vessel designation and complement?
 TROI / (without hesitation) NCC One-seven-three... Daedalus class starship. Crew of two hundred twenty-nine.
 PICARD / Under whose command in this sector?
 TROI / (right back) Admiral Uttan Narsu, Starbase Twelve. You will find all of this in Starfleet records...
 PICARD / I do not need to see the records.
 TROI / Then you know I am correct.
 PICARD / End this now and I will do whatever I can to help you...
 TROI / (with regret) No. You do not trust me. And I cannot risk trusting you.
 DATA / It is taking too long. We sh-should have been there by now...
 DATA / He is manipulating you...
 TROI / Captain Picard has every right to be curious...
 DATA / He will try to delay until a rescue attempt is possible.
 TROI / I know that. But I also know that he will make every effort to protect the lives of his crew.
 TROI / (turns to Picard) Since our demands are not excessive, I hope you will see it is simpler to accede than to risk further injuries.
 PICARD / What do you want?
 TROI / All you need to know for now, Captain, is that we want to rest. Simply, finally... to rest.
 GEORDI / (reading signs) ... Section Two - B... A... Section One...
 GEORDI / (chuckles) I hear you. This is what starship designers call "easy access"...
 GEORDI / (continuing) This is it. I thought we might have a problem with conduit two- twenty-seven -- but it looks like we can get by it...
 GEORDI / Let's hook up the scanner and see what we've got...
 GEORDI / We're halfway home... (taps communicator) La Forge to Crusher. How's it going?
 BEVERLY / I think I've come up with an idea for a containment field. This anionic energy seems to be vulnerable to the same magnetic flux density we monitored in the storms. If I can duplicate that, we can trap it once it's out of our people.
 GEORDI / You ought to be able to do it by pumping Ten Forward full of ionogenic particles.
 BEVERLY / Exactly what I was thinking...
 RIKER / How long will it take to get it all ready?
 GEORDI / We still have to calibrate the plasma invertor, Commander... I'm guessing forty-five minutes to an hour...
 BEVERLY / I'll have the containment field ready by then.
 RIKER / Keep me advised.
 PICARD / Impressions, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Spiritual possessions of this sort have been reported throughout Klingon history. It is called "Jat'yIn" -- the taking of the living by the dead.
 PICARD / Yes, Human history is also full of similar legends.
 WORF / Then, you believe they may be telling the truth?
 PICARD / Not for a moment.
 WORF / Sir, they seem to know much about the Essex... if it really is the spirit of Captain Shumar...
 PICARD / (not really serious) ... then he should be on much better behavior, don't you think... ? A Starfleet Captain?
 WORF / After living disembodied for two centuries, perhaps they have gone mad...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, I assure you these are not Jat'yIn. Our job is to find out what they are... and then to determine how to deal with them...
 DATA / Stop speaking!
 TROI / (stern) Leave her alone.
 PICARD / Captain Shumar...
 PICARD / We will reach the polar position you requested in minutes... I will need to give additional instructions...
 TROI / (takes a beat to consider) Very well. We are taking you to our crash site...
 PICARD / (reacts) At the southern pole... ?
 TROI / That is correct.
 PICARD / (suspicious) Nothing our sensors were able to detect indicated that the Essex went down in the polar region...
 DATA / (quick) Well, it d-did.
 TROI / (smooth) I told you, Captain... the ship broke apart in the atmosphere. The bridge went down here.
 TROI / When we reach it, you are going to beam what's left of our skeletal remains aboard this ship... and take them back to Earth for a proper burial.
 TROI / See how simple a request it is... ?
 PICARD / Let these people go... and I will order the bridge to follow your instructions.
 TROI / (beat) No. No one will be released.
 PICARD / If you are who you say you are, there is no need for any of this... we will gladly take you home.
 TROI / (shakes her head) I wish you were truly so open-minded, Picard...
 PICARD / If you do not release the hostages, I will not cooperate.
 DATA / You will cooperate... you will c-cooperate... or someone will die, Captain... who will it be... ?
 DATA / How about the Klingon?
 DATA / (to O'Brien) Get another one.
 DATA / Pick one to die, Captain. Or I will kill them both...
 WORF / Choose me, Captain.
 GEORDI / I'm only gonna be able to shut down the forcefield for about seven seconds before the computer compensates...
 GEORDI / Bridge, stand by to release the ionogenic field on my signal...
 RIKER / Standing by...
 GEORDI / (to Ro) Ready...
 GEORDI / Forcefield down...
 DATA / Tell them to stop, or I'll kill everyone in this room! Starting with you.
 PICARD / Picard to bridge. Abort immediately.
 RIKER / As you say, Captain... (beat) Riker to La Forge, return to the bridge.
 TROI / Are you prepared to cooperate?
 PICARD / (beat, hoarse) Yes.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprise has moved into a synchronous orbit near the southern polar region. We await further instructions from Ten Forward.
 RIKER / Any sign of the Essex?
 GEORDI / Negative, Commander. The electromagnetic disturbances are even worse here... scanners can't read a thing...
 RIKER / Bridge to Ten Forward.
 RIKER / Intense storm activity over the southern pole is making it virtually impossible for us to pick up any trace of the Essex...
 TROI / We're giving you the exact coordinates of our remains aboard the wreck of the Essex...
 GEORDI / I'm receiving the coordinates now...
 RIKER / (signals Ro to mute) Geordi, can you tell what's there?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) Just your basic ionic cyclone. I can't read a thing.
 RIKER / I'm sure as hell not going to just beam up whatever might be down there...
 GEORDI / I've got a good excuse for you. The transporters aren't going to work any better than the scanners...
 RIKER / Bridge to Ten Forward... the same interference that is blocking our scanners would prevent us from using the transporters...
 PICARD / On the contrary, we've had a difficult time with transport since our arrival... that's why we had to send down the shuttle. You should all be well aware of that fact.
 DATA / We must be able to use the transporters...
 PICARD / In fact, Chief O'Brien was the one who successfully executed the return of the away team... he is the most qualified on board to operate the transporter under these circumstances...
 TROI / Can you do it from here?
 PICARD / (to O'Brien) I would be willing to grant you safe passage to the transporter pad in one of the cargo bays...
 DATA / It is a trick... he is trying to divide us...
 TROI / (paces, thinks) We must not be separated.
 PICARD / I offer to grant you all safe passage.
 DATA / Why are you b-being so helpful suddenly?
 PICARD / Because I assume if you go to the cargo bay, you will choose not to take all of the hostages. Their safety is my primary concern.
 TROI / (to the others) What are the risks when we leave this room?
 DATA / Without the p-protection of the forcefield, we are vulnerable in a number of ways...
 RIKER / Ten Forward, in order to do that, you'll have to release your computer control lock-outs...
 PICARD / Let me speak to him.
 PICARD / Number One, I think we have an opportunity to end this seige...
 PICARD / (continuing) But it will require cooperation from all concerned. Our guests will be moving shortly to cargo bay four, where the transport will occur. You are to ensure their safe passage from Ten Forward to the cargo bay.
 RIKER / Understood, Captain. (signals to mute) Mister La Forge, Doctor...
 GEORDI / Aye, sir...
 RIKER / (frowns) Almost had them, Ensign... nice try... (to com) Ten Forward. Our mistake. Remaining transporter functions are being transferred to you...
 DATA / What about their weapons?
 TROI / We will each take a hostage for protection... Captain Picard, you are mine.
 TROI / (to Data) Lower the forcefield.
 RIKER / Security teams, stand by.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge, Doctor -- they'll be at their destination in less than a minute...
 RIKER / (into com) Security, allow them access into cargo bay four...
 PICARD / Captain Shumar, may I ask a foolish question?
 TROI / You are not one to ask foolish questions, Picard...
 PICARD / Nevertheless, I must ask how you intend to achieve your "rest"... when all is said and done...
 TROI / What do you mean?
 PICARD / How do you intend to free yourself of this existence that has trapped your consciousness?
 TROI / It will fade as we move further from this planet...
 PICARD / Really? What is your scientific basis for that?
 TROI / (impatient) I don't need a scientific basis. Just be quiet.
 PICARD / Perhaps you will be required to perform a noble deed before you can rest.
 TROI / What are you talking about?
 PICARD / Surely you recall the old story of "The Canterville Ghost"...
 TROI / Do not insult me with foolish ghost stories, Picard...
 PICARD / I would ask the same of you. (beat) When are you going to tell me who you really are?
 TROI / (still staring at Picard) Proceed.
 RIKER / Mister LaForge...
 GEORDI / I've isolated cargo bay four with a neutrino field, sir... But it won't take O'Brien and Data more than a couple of minutes to override it once they discover it's there...
 RIKER / I hope that'll be enough time for the captain to play his hand...
 RIKER / There's only one reason he chose cargo bay four... (grim, to Ro) If it becomes necessary, Ensign, you will blow the cargo bay hatch on my orders.
 TROI / You're quite right, Picard. We're not ghosts. And it is not rest, we seek. Only escape.
 PICARD / Escape?
 TROI / We were brought to this moon over five centuries ago from a star system called Ux-Mal... We were separated from our bodies and left to drift in the storms. Once we almost escaped... on board the Essex... but that ship was incapable of eluding the moon's electromagnetic currents...
 PICARD / Did you really think using their identities would gain our sympathy... ?
 TROI / It was a better approach than asking you to allow hundreds of condemned prisoners on board...
 PICARD / Then, this moon is a penal colony...
 TROI / That is correct. But now we have your ship... and your bodies to carry us home...
 BEVERLY / They have the same anionic signature we saw on the biofilter scans...
 RIKER / (pleased) I think we can give the captain a new bargaining chip. Doctor Crusher, flood the cargo bay with your containment field...
 TROI / Let them go, or you will all die.
 PICARD / Your threats are meaningless now.
 PICARD / Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of the others? Because they will all die when the hatch to the cargo bay is blown...
 DATA / (to Picard) You will die too...
 WORF / To die defending his ship is the hope of every Klingon.
 PICARD / And if you each know the officers you inhabit, you know they are equally ready to give their lives for this ship. (beat) Free them now... And I will return you to the moon's surface.
 TROI / I advise you, Picard, not to pass our way again.
 PICARD / (hits combadge) Picard to bridge, our guests will be leaving shortly... I need an emergency medical team here...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / On our way, Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, transport these... prisoners... back to the moon's surface...
 WORF / Gladly, sir...
 TROI / It was almost as though my own consciousness were pushed to the side... I was watching it all happen... hearing my own voice... but I couldn't control any of it...
 PICARD / What about the entity that controlled you... what were your perceptions of him?
 TROI / He was intelligent, actually. Thoughtful... in a ruthless sort of way. Cold.
 DATA / I must apologize for my inadvertant misconduct toward you, Lieutenant.
 WORF / There is no need to apologize.
 DATA / Your restraint was most remarkable for a Klingon.
 WORF / (beat) You have no idea.
 BEVERLY / How do you feel?
 BEVERLY / Good sign.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45587.3. We are picking up a consignment of chlorinide from Starbase Twenty-seven for transportation to the Mylaira system. Once we have delivered this material, we will investigate reported subspace anomalies in the Kelnaria region.
 WORF and GEORDI are scanning some LARGE CARGO / CONTAINERS with tricorders. There are other N.D. CREWMEMBERS in the b.g. checking the containers as well. The containers have been stacked in an intricate framework of metal support beams, pallettes, and lattices which reaches to the ceiling and almost completely fills the room.
 GEORDI / (to Worf) No question. She was bluffing.
 WORF / Bluffing is not one of Counselor Troi's strong suits.
 GEORDI / (off tricorder, to Worf) I'm still reading some chlorinide leakage, but I can't pin it down.
 GEORDI / (points to different section) Maybe over there...
 WORF / It would have been unwise to call. My hand was not strong enough.
 GEORDI / You had jacks and eights and she bluffed you with a pair of sixes.
 WORF / (outraged) Sixes!
 WORF / How do you know what I had?
 GEORDI / Let's just say... I had a special insight into your cards.
 GEORDI / (off his look) Hey, next time bring a deck that's not transparent to infrared light.
 GEORDI / (with humor) Don't worry, I only peek after the hand is over.
 GEORDI / (frustrated, off tricorder) Still nothing. Well... I'll get a dynoscanner and try again.
 GEORDI / Worf!
 GEORDI / (urgent, to communicator) La Forge to sickbay! Medical emergency in cargo bay three!
 WORF / What... happened?
 BEVERLY / The containers you were checking fell on you. You're lucky to be alive.
 WORF / I will not attempt to leave sickbay without your approval, Doctor. The restraining field is not necessary.
 BEVERLY / Worf... there is no restraining field.
 WORF / (objecting) But I cannot move my legs.
 BEVERLY / I know. (beat) You can't move because one of the containers shattered seven of your vertebrae... and crushed your spinal cord.
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid... there's no way to repair this kind of injury.
 BEVERLY / I know what you're trying to do and I understand why. But it's important that you remain in bed.
 WORF / Klingons do not... lie in bed.
 BEVERLY / They do if they have extensive internal injuries which need time to heal.
 WORF / The muscles in my legs will atrophy unless they are used. (MORE)
 WORF (cont'd) / A vigorous program of exercise will be necessary for a full recovery.
 BEVERLY / I understand that as a Klingon this is difficult for you... but you have to face your situation as it really is... not as you want it to be. (beat) I've sent for a neurogeneticist, but... you need to realize that you'll probably never regain total use of your legs.
 WORF / (quiet) Leave me.
 BEVERLY / Your son has been asking to see you.
 WORF / (forceful) No. I will not have him see me like this.
 BEVERLY / All right.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Doctor Crusher. The Potemkin has arrived and Doctor Russell is ready to transport aboard.
 BEVERLY / (to com) I'm on my way.
 BEVERLY / Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Doctor Russell. I'm Beverly Crusher.
 BEVERLY / (to Technician) Send it to medlab four.
 BEVERLY / (pleased) Really? You're the first person to mention it.
 BEVERLY / Thank you. (beat) Have you had a chance to review Worf's case history yet?
 BEVERLY / It's a cultural bias. When I contacted the Klingon Medical Division, I was told they usually let the patient die in a case like this... as a result they've done almost no research on neurological trauma.
 BEVERLY / Worf's been having a hard time dealing with his injuries. He's always been a difficult patient, but now...
 BEVERLY / He's a little tough to get along with at first, but I think you'll get to like him after---
 BEVERLY / Yes... you're probably right.
 BEVERLY / Yes. This way.
 RIKER / You look pretty good for someone who's been eating sickbay food for three days.
 WORF / Please sit down, Commander.
 WORF / Thank you for agreeing to see me in... this condition.
 RIKER / Worf, I'm not Klingon... I don't think there's any shame in being injured.
 WORF / I am not merely injured... Doctor Crusher believes my... paralysis will be permanent.
 RIKER / I'm... sorry.
 WORF / I have a personal favor to ask.
 RIKER / Name it.
 WORF / I want you to assist me in performing the... Hegh'bat ceremony. (beat) I want you to help me die.
 RIKER / What?
 WORF / When a Klingon can no longer stand and face his enemies as a warrior... when he becomes a burden to his family and friends... it is time for the Hegh'bat... time for him to die.
 RIKER / Worf, there have to be other options.
 WORF / (firm) No, there are not. (beat, then quieter) I will not live as an object of... pity... or shame. My life as a Klingon is over.
 RIKER / I won't help a friend commit suicide.
 WORF / We have served together for many years... fought side by side... I know you to be a brave and honorable man... if you truly consider me your friend... help me now... help me end my life as I lived it... with dignity and honor. (beat) Please.
 BEVERLY / The cortico-spinal tract has continued to deteriorate over the past seventy-two hours despite CPK enzymatic therapy.
 BEVERLY / Ineffective.
 BEVERLY / Klingon medicine refers to it as the brak'lul... almost every vital function in their bodies has a built-in redundancy in case the primary organ or system fails.
 BEVERLY / I've read some of the preliminary work you've done... I thought this was still in the experimental stage.
 BEVERLY / (a little shocked) Replace his entire spinal column?
 BEVERLY / (looking for the data) I had no idea you were already using this on humanoids...
 BEVERLY / (reacts) First time?
 BEVERLY / Thirty-seven percent... even a holographic patient would balk at those odds.
 BEVERLY / We're talking about a spinal column. Even to attempt it, you'd have to remove his existing spine. We don't know enough about Klingon neurological medicine to reattach it. If something goes wrong, he'll die.
 BEVERLY / I agree it has remarkable potential but it's still in the most preliminary stages of research. We can't possibly justify the risk to Worf. I'm afraid we'll just have to make do with the more conventional approaches.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Doctor Crusher, please report to the bridge.
 BEVERLY / (to com) On my way.
 PICARD, DATA, and Riker at their stations. Beverly / ENTERS from a turbolift.
 PICARD / Doctor, the transport ship Denver has struck a gravitic mine left over from the Cardassian war. They've sustained heavy damage.
 RIKER / Their last message said they were attempting to crash land on one of the planets in the Mericor system. We should arrive in just under seven hours.
 BEVERLY / How many people were aboard?
 DATA / The Denver's standard crew complement is twenty-three, but they were transporting five hundred seventeen colonists to the Beloti sector.
 BEVERLY / I'll need to convert all three shuttlebays to emergency triage centers. I also want all civilians with medical training to report for duty.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Captain, may I speak with you in private?
 PICARD / Certainly, Number One. Mister Data, you have the bridge.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / I've always tried to keep an open mind... not to judge someone else's culture by my own... but for me to be a part of this "ceremony"...
 PICARD / I understand that Doctor Crusher believes he will never regain the use of his legs.
 RIKER / That doesn't mean his life is over.
 PICARD / That's a very... Human perspective, Will. But to any Klingon in Worf's position... life is over.
 RIKER / I can't accept that.
 PICARD / If you were dying... terminally ill from a disease for which there was no cure... and the few remaining days of your life would be spent in pain. Don't you think that you might come to see death as... a release?
 RIKER / Worf isn't dying and he's not in pain... he can live a long life without---
 PICARD / (firm) You or I could learn to live with a disability of this kind. But to Worf... his life ended when those containers fell on him. We don't have to agree with it... we don't have to understand it... but we do have to respect his beliefs.
 RIKER / (repeating for emphasis) I can respect his beliefs, but Worf wants me to take an active role in ending his life.
 PICARD / He asked for your help because you're his friend. That means that you'll have to make your decision based on that friendship.
 RIKER / Which leaves me right back where I started.
 PICARD / I'm sorry, Will. I can't make this decision for you... but I can tell you that Klingons choose their friends with great care. If Worf didn't feel he could count on you... he never would have asked.
 TROI is trying to deal with a very angry ALEXANDER. / 
 TROI / Alexander, I told you it's not my decision. Your father doesn't want to---
 TROI / I think you know that's not true.
 TROI / Your father is going through a very difficult time. He needs to be alone for now.
 TROI / He's been injured, Alexander, and he's... embarrassed. To have anyone see him now would make him feel worse... even if it were you.
 TROI / Alexander, that... "Klingon stuff" is very important to your father.
 TROI / It's been a long day... why don't you get ready for bed and we'll talk about this again in the morning.
 TROI / Alexander is scared... confused... hurt... and all because his father is refusing to see him.
 WORF / You know why I left those instructions.
 TROI / Yes I do. It's not the "Klingon" way, right?
 WORF / It is a question of honor, and I would ask you to respect my wishes in this matter, Counselor.
 TROI / All I care about at this moment is a little boy who's terrified he's going to lose his father.
 TROI / (quiet, but firm) Maybe it's time you stopped lying around here worrying about your honor... and began thinking about someone else... like your son.
 BEVERLY / Would you like us to come back later?
 WORF / No. Come in, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / This is Doctor Toby Russell from the Adelman Neurological Institute. She specializes in spinal injuries like yours.
 WORF / (to Russell) Doctor.
 WORF / Please proceed.
 BEVERLY / We've discussed a variety of surgical procedures... I'm afraid none of them would be able to repair the spinal cord. But we do have a way for you to regain most of your mobility.
 BEVERLY / (indicating monitor) We can implant a series of neural transducers in your lower torso and legs. They're designed to pick up the electrical impulses from your brain and then stimulate the corresponding muscles. With a little work, you'll eventually regain sixty to seventy percent of your motor control.
 BEVERLY / That's good for a first try. It'll take some time before you get used to manipulating the---
 WORF / (firm) No.
 WORF / I will not live like that.
 BEVERLY / These are very sophisticated devices. With enough time, they will give you--
 WORF / Sixty percent of my mobility. I will not be seen... lurching through corridors like some half-Klingon machine... an object of ridicule and disgust.
 BEVERLY / I understand how you feel... and I know that right now, this all sounds a little frightening... but I think it's important that you take your time before making a decision. All I ask is that you give this some thought.
 BEVERLY / I thought we had discussed genetronics.
 BEVERLY / And I also thought we had decided against recommending it.
 BEVERLY / He's grasping at straws and you're giving him one. Now, instead of dealing with his paralysis, he's going to be thinking about this miracle cure of yours.
 BEVERLY / You're using the desperation of an injured man as an excuse to try a procedure you couldn't do under normal circumstances. I checked with Starfleet Medical and they've refused your requests to test genetronics on humanoids three times already.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Doctor Crusher.
 BEVERLY / (to com) Go ahead, Captain.
 PICARD / We've located the survivors from the Denver.
 BEVERLY / We're ready down here. I have triage teams standing by.
 PICARD / Very well. We'll begin transporting the casualties aboard immediately. Bridge out.
 BEVERLY / Absolutely.
 WORF / Come in, Alexander.
 WORF / I am... still struggling with my injury.
 WORF / We have much to talk about, Alexander. There will be difficult times ahead... you must be strong.
 WORF / Good.
 WORF / As Klingons, we must always be prepared for any---
 WORF / (to Troi) Take him away.
 TROI / Worf, let me help you---
 WORF / (harsh to Alexander) Leave!
 TROI / Go on, Alexander. It'll be all right. I'll take care of your father.
 BEVERLY / What happened here?
 BEVERLY / (puzzled) From leporazine? That's unusual.
 BEVERLY / A morathial series?
 BEVERLY / You used this man for one of your experiments?
 BEVERLY / Morathial would have saved his life.
 BEVERLY / The point is, you didn't even try the standard treatments.
 BEVERLY / I think you took advantage of the situation in order to test one of your theories -- just like you're trying to do with Worf.
 BEVERLY / What this is about is the kind of medicine you seem to practice.
 BEVERLY / I doubt that will comfort his family.
 BEVERLY / I won't get drawn into a hypothetical argument, Doctor. Your research on this ship is over. You're relieved from all medical duties until further notice. Is that clear?
 BEVERLY / Good morning.
 WORF / Doctor.
 BEVERLY / I'd like to run a couple of tests today... most of it is fairly boring: blood work, molecular studies, things like that.
 WORF / Why do you wish to do these tests?
 BEVERLY / I need the data for some preparatory work I've been doing.
 WORF / Work... on the implants?
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 WORF / I will not submit to the test.
 BEVERLY / I'm not trying to pressure you... but we need to have some of this work done in case you change your mind.
 WORF / I have made my decision. I wish to die.
 BEVERLY / There are alternatives other than full recovery and ending your life. The use of neural implants is only one of them.
 WORF / I am not interested.
 BEVERLY / (frustrated) You haven't even heard me out.
 WORF / No! (beat, then quieter) Leave me... please.
 PICARD / Doctor?
 PICARD / I was on my way to look in on your patient.
 BEVERLY / Be my guest... but don't expect a lot of conversation, he's in full Klingon mode: honorable, strong... and closed-minded.
 PICARD / I understand you've relieved Doctor Russell of duty.
 BEVERLY / That's right. She's irresponsible. I won't have her practicing medicine on this ship.
 PICARD / Beverly... maybe you should consider letting her go ahead with the genetronic procedure.
 BEVERLY / How can you say that? She has a theory, based on a little empirical data and a lot of supposition...
 PICARD / If he can't make a full recovery... Worf's going to kill himself.
 BEVERLY / (firm) Not in my sickbay, he's not. I'll put him in a restraining field and post security outside the door before I let him commit suicide.
 PICARD / How long could you keep him like that? A week... a month... a year?
 BEVERLY / If I have to. Suicide is not an option. (beat) Setting aside for the moment the fact that a paraplegic can live a very full life, there is also a conventional therapy that can restore much of his mobility.
 PICARD / But not all of it.
 BEVERLY / (frustrated) No, not all of it! There are some things I can't fix. Klingon or not, he's got to accept that his condition---
 PICARD / He can't make the journey you're asking of him, Beverly. (beat) You want him to go from contemplating suicide to accepting his condition and living with the disability. But that's too far... the road in between covers a lifetime of values and beliefs... he can't do it.
 PICARD / But perhaps he can come part of the way... maybe he can be persuaded to forgo the ritual... in order to take a chance at regaining the kind of life he needs. (beat) A Klingon may not be able to accept defeat... but he knows all about taking risks.
 BEVERLY / Starfleet Medical has rejected her proposals to use genetronics on humanoids three times.
 PICARD / If they were aware of all the circumstances in this case... don't you think it might affect their decision?
 BEVERLY / The first tenet of good medicine is don't make the patient any worse. Right now he's alive and functioning... but if he goes into this operation he'll probably come away a corpse.
 PICARD / It may not be good medicine... but for Worf, it may be the only choice.
 RIKER / (to computer) Continue program.
 WORF / I am ready, Commander.
 RIKER / I've been studying this ritual of yours, and you know what I've decided? (beat) I think it's despicable.
 RIKER / I hate everything about it... the casual disregard for life... the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honor. I may have to respect your beliefs... but I don't have to like them.
 WORF / It is not something I expect you to understand.
 RIKER / No... All you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away, so you can kill yourself in peace. Well, I'm not going to make it that easy for you.
 WORF / It is not easy for me. But each of us must die when his time comes... and my time---
 RIKER / Do you remember Sandoval?
 RIKER / Hit by a disruptor blast two years ago. She lived for about a week. How about Fang-lee... Marla Aster... Tasha Yar... how many good men and women -- how many friends have we watched die? Even I've lost count. But every one of them -- every single one -- fought for life until the very end.
 WORF / I do not welcome death, Commander.
 RIKER / Are you sure? I get the sense you're feeling pretty noble about the whole thing. (mocking) Look at Worf... isn't he courageous? Isn't he an honorable Klingon?
 RIKER / Well, let me remind you of something... a Klingon does not put his own desires above those of his family and friends. (beat) How many people on this ship consider you a friend? How many owe you their lives? Have you given any thought to how you have affected the people around you? And how they might feel about your dying?
 RIKER / And what about the Klingon Empire? If you hadn't put yourself on the line, the Empire would be ruled by Duras and allied with the Romulans. Maybe you should think about what you still have left to do instead of lying around and --
 WORF / (a shout) Enough!
 WORF / (quieter) Will you, or will you not, help me with the Hegh'bat?
 RIKER / You're my friend... and in spite of everything I've said... if it were my place, I'd probably help you. (beat) But I've been studying Klingon law and ritual... and I discovered that it's not my place to fill that role. (beat) According to tradition, that honor falls to a family member... preferably the oldest son.
 WORF / That is not possible. He is a child.
 RIKER / "The son of a Klingon is a man the day he can first hold a blade." True?
 WORF / Alexander is not fully Klingon... he is part Human.
 RIKER / That's an excuse. What you really mean to say is that it would be too hard for you to look at your son and tell him that he must hand you the knife... watch you stab it into your heart... and then pull the knife from your chest and wipe the blood on his sleeve. (beat) That is the rite of death, isn't it?
 RIKER / I'm sorry, Worf... but I can't help you. There's only one person on board who can do that.
 WORF / I need you to help me.
 WORF / I've taught you about Klingon customs... the beliefs which we value. (beat) According to tradition, I must take my life after suffering this kind of injury.
 WORF / But I have decided to break with tradition. I have decided to live.
 WORF / I must still undergo a dangerous operation. I may still die. But it will not be by my own hand.
 WORF / Return this to our quarters.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Chief Medical Officer's log, supplemental. After further consultation with Starfleet Medical, and a great deal of soul-searching... I have reluctantly granted Lieutenant Worf's request to undergo the genetronic procedure.
 WORF / We will speak again soon.
 WORF / If I die... he must be cared for...
 TROI / I'll make sure he reaches your parents' home safely.
 WORF / No. My parents are elderly. They cannot care for Alexander. (beat) Counselor, I have given this a great deal of thought... I have a serious request to make of you. Would you consider...
 TROI / You want me to raise Alexander... ?
 WORF / (softly, warm) I have come to have a great... (unsaid affection) ... respect for you, Deanna. You have been most helpful in guiding me since Alexander's arrival. I cannot imagine anyone who would make a better parent to my son. (beat as they look at each other) If it is too much to ask...
 TROI / I'd be honored.
 WORF / I am ready.
 BEVERLY / Focused.
 BEVERLY / (off monitor) All neural connections below the first cervical vertebrae have been separated.
 BEVERLY / (to Ogawa) Exo-scalpel.
 RIKER / I've notified Starfleet that our survey of sector three-seven-six-two-eight will have to be delayed at least a week while we drop off survivors from the Denver.
 PICARD / Good. (beat) I understand Mister La Forge has reported a minor fluctuation in the starboard warp coil.
 RIKER / (acknowledges) I've scheduled a stress simulation routine for this afternoon to check it out.
 RIKER / Has there been any word?
 PICARD / No.
 BEVERLY / Reading initial sequences at ten to the ninth base pairs per second.
 BEVERLY / (concerned) What happened?
 BEVERLY / (concerned) Did this show up in your simulations?
 BEVERLY / Got it. (beat) Watch the proximal nerve endings.
 BEVERLY / Twenty cc's inoprovaline.
 BEVERLY / Looking good so far...
 BEVERLY / Forty cc's inoprovaline.
 BEVERLY / Increase oxygen mixture to ninety-five percent.
 BEVERLY / Seventy-five cc's inoprovaline.
 BEVERLY / Okay... let's go to chlromydride. Fifteen cc's.
 BEVERLY / All right... twenty-five cc's of cordrazine.
 BEVERLY / (bitter) Looks like we've done a pretty good job of that already, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Cortical stimulator.
 BEVERLY / Now.
 BEVERLY / Again.
 BEVERLY / (insistent) Again.
 BEVERLY / All right... (to Ogawa) Make a note in the log. (beat) Death occurred at... twelve hundred, forty hours.
 TROI / (reacts) No...
 BEVERLY / Alexander... I'm so sorry...
 TROI / Alex...
 BEVERLY / (to Ogawa) Activate biomonitors. Twenty-five cc's polyadrenaline.
 BEVERLY / (still looking at monitors) I'm not sure... (beat, realizing) But, if I'm right, one of those "unnecessary redundancies" might be---
 BEVERLY / That's it! Begin cardio-aid and ventilation.
 BEVERLY / (amazed) Look at that... he must have a backup for his synaptic functions as well.
 BEVERLY / I'm delighted that Worf is going to recover. You gambled. He won. Most of your patients aren't so lucky. (beat) You scare me, Doctor. You risk peoples' lives and justify it in the name of research. But genuine research takes time... sometimes a lifetime of painstaking, detailed work to get results. Not you -- you take shortcuts... right through living tissue. You put your "research" ahead of your patients, and as far as I'm concerned, that's a violation of our most sacred trust. (beat) No one remembers the patients who died unnecessarily... not in the glow of a remarkable achievement like this one, do they? I'm sure the work you've done here will be hailed as a stunning breakthrough. Enjoy your laurels, Doctor. I'm not sure I could.
 BEVERLY / I told you this would take time, Worf.
 BEVERLY / Your muscles are still sorting out the new neural inputs... don't rush it.
 TROI / (softly) Alexander, remember what we talked about. Your father wants to do this by himself.
 WORF / It's all right, Counselor. I would... appreciate some help from my son.
 WORF / (to Alexander) We will... work together.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45614.6. We have been contacted by an androgynous race called the J'naii to investigate the disappearance of a shuttlecraft.
 PICARD, RIKER, WORF, DATA, SUPERNUMERARIES, and several / J'naii, including SOREN and KRITE. The J'naii are a genderless species; Soren and Krite, like the others, possess no demonstrable sexual characteristics. All the J'naii look remarkably alike: strikingly attractive, with lithe, slim bodies and chiseled, delicate features. Soren is near Riker; Krite at an aft station.
 DATA / We are approaching the designated coordinates, Captain.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Long-range scan, Mister Data.
 DATA / Sensors find no evidence of the shuttle anywhere within the star system.
 RIKER / Mister Data, reconfigure for a high-resolution sweep with a radius of one million kilometers. Look for possible debris.
 DATA / Scan shows no debris within that radius.
 DATA / Captain, I am detecting an unusual reading... It appears to be a neutrino emission with no visible source.
 PICARD / Explanation?
 DATA / I have none. I recommend we launch a probe.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 WORF / The probe is launched.
 DATA / The probe is transmitting information within normal parameters. Sensors do not show evidence of any unusual phenomenon --
 DATA / The probe is no longer transmitting.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The sudden disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first instance of what is called null space -- an anomaly which until now had been only theoretical. Commander Riker has been working around the clock with a team of J'naii specialists to formalize this hypothesis.
 RIKER / We think your system contains one of these null pockets.
 RIKER / If we're right, this pocket would absorb electromagnetic energy from anything that entered it...
 RIKER / Or a probe. Making them powerless.
 RIKER / We think so. The ship probably couldn't sustain its power... but other than that it wouldn't be damaged.
 RIKER / We can send one of our shuttles into the null space -- but its energy output would be absorbed as well. Our chief engineer is working on a way to maintain the power reserves long enough to rescue your crew.
 RIKER / It's a Starfleet craft...
 RIKER / You can't pilot a shuttle you're not familiar with.
 RIKER / I happen to be a good pilot, too. I also know my way around Starfleet shuttles. So... what if we team up?
 RIKER / Right now.
 RIKER / It's a short-range craft... with two twelve-hundred fifty millicochrane warp engines...
 RIKER / Right.
 RIKER / Usually none. But it's been fitted with two type-four phaser emitters... we'll use them to chart the null space.
 RIKER / Commander La Forge wants to get an idea of how big this pocket is. He thinks the rate of energy absorption will be linked to its size.
 RIKER / That's where the emitters come in. We'll shoot a series of photon pulses into the pocket and chart the points where they disappear. We should be able to plot a fairly complete outline that way.
 RIKER / Maybe later we can try a flight simulation, but first let's do a systems review. (taps controls) I'll walk you through it...
 RIKER / You're handling those controls like you grew up in a shuttle...
 RIKER / He had a good student.
 RIKER / Okay. For two days I've been trying to construct sentences without personal pronouns. I give up... what should I say? "It?" To us, that's almost rude.
 RIKER / (good-naturedly) Then I'll just have to muddle through... so be tolerant if a stray "he" or "she" slips by, okay?
 RIKER / Lunch.
 RIKER / Split pea soup. My father's recipe. I had it programmed into the replicators.
 RIKER / Well?
 RIKER / It's very healthy. Helps keep you warm on a cold Alaskan night.
 RIKER / I see...
 RIKER / Sounds better than pea soup.
 RIKER / A little. It's hard to grasp the idea of having no gender...
 RIKER / Snips and snails and puppy dog's tails...
 RIKER / (laughing) That's an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made of sugar and spice. Boys are made of snips and snails...
 RIKER / It's an old fashioned way of looking at the sexes. Not to say that there aren't real differences. Physically, men tend to be bigger... stronger in the upper body. We have different sexual organs. Men don't bear young...
 RIKER / Well... most people think so. But that's the kind of question that might take an hour or two to answer.
 RIKER / Let me ask you... (struggling a bit) What's it like... on a planet where the people have no gender?
 RIKER / Well... who leads when you dance? If you dance...
 RIKER / Without the "battle of the sexes"... you probably don't have as many arguments...
 RIKER / Sounds like there aren't that many differences between your species and mine...
 RIKER / I like a woman who's intelligent and sure of herself... somebody I can talk to and get something back. (beat) But the most important thing of all -- she has to laugh at my jokes.
 RIKER / Not at all. Some men like quiet, demure women... others prefer a lot of energy... some respond only to physical attractiveness... others couldn't care less. There aren't any rules.
 RIKER / Believe me -- it is.
 RIKER / Good evening.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45616.3. Commander Riker and the J'naii pilot have set out on a mission to chart the null space pocket. If they are successful, we can then proceed with a rescue attempt.
 RIKER / Stand by forward phaser array...
 RIKER / Firing second burst...
 RIKER / It's working. I think we'll be able to give Commander La Forge the information he needs.
 RIKER / I'm initiating computer task hand-off...
 RIKER / Ahhh...
 RIKER / No... but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation...
 RIKER / Correcting course... zero-two-one mark zero...
 RIKER / Right. Well, it's pretty simple. The men inseminate the women and the women carry the babies.
 RIKER / (to himself) And less enjoyable...
 RIKER / (trying to explain) For Humans... the sexual act brings a closeness... an intimacy... it's a very pleasurable experience... (beat: on the other hand) Inseminating a husk...
 RIKER / I'm picking up a neutrino emission... from within the null space.
 RIKER / What... ?
 RIKER / I don't know...
 RIKER / Why not?
 RIKER / (good naturedly) Primitive.
 RIKER / Maybe so. But sometimes there's a lot to be said for an experience that's... primitive.
 RIKER / (checking monitor) Adjusting course... zero-two-nine mark zero.
 RIKER / The port engine is down...
 RIKER / That's not enough... I have to activate the maneuvering thrusters to correct the spin...
 RIKER / Inertial dampers are failing... hang on!
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Enterprise to shuttle... do you read me?
 RIKER / Affirmative... we've lost an engine...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We'll try to get a tractor beam on you...
 RIKER / (with difficulty) The sooner the better...
 RIKER / Enterprise, we have an injury. Transport Soren directly to sickbay.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Right away, Commander.
 BEVERLY / It's just a mild concussion... You're going to be fine. (using tricorder) This will reduce the inflammation.
 BEVERLY / Yes...
 BEVERLY / Well... it's... just the way I am. I've never thought about what it's like.
 BEVERLY / Very specific biological factors. Females carry two X chromosomes, males carry an X and a Y. Hormone levels are distinctly different; males produce primarily testosterone, while women produce estrogen. Our sexual organs are very different -- females' are geared to bearing and nursing the young.
 BEVERLY / Color... ?
 BEVERLY / That's true...
 BEVERLY / It's a long-time custom... we're used to it... (beat -- with a smile) ... but I think the real reason -- is to attract men.
 BEVERLY / Mmmm-hmmmm...
 BEVERLY / Oh, believe me, men want to be attractive, too -- but they go about it differently.
 BEVERLY / No color. They'd rather pretend they're not doing anything to attract a woman... even when it's the most important thing on their minds.
 BEVERLY / Neither. In the past, women were often considered weak and inferior. But that hasn't been true for a long time.
 BEVERLY / Yes. As a matter of fact, I enjoy it a lot.
 BEVERLY / Will... your co-pilot is fine. The injury was minor.
 RIKER / I'm glad to hear it.
 RIKER / Then you should hear my new regulation: no more gymnastics in the shuttlecraft.
 RIKER / I'm glad you're all right...
 RIKER / Apparently, the port engine nacelle nicked one of the protrusions from the null pocket, and shut down.
 RIKER / That depends on how you're doing.
 RIKER / Whoa... let's get the doctor's opinion first...
 BEVERLY / I don't see a problem. But if you have any symptoms... headache, dizziness -- come back.
 TROI / All right... this round, the game is -- Federation Day.
 WORF / What is that?
 TROI / The Federation was founded in Twenty-one-sixty-one. So twos, sixes, and aces are wild.
 WORF / That is a woman's game.
 TROI / (unbothered) Oh? Why is that?
 WORF / All those wild cards... they support a weak hand. A man's game has no wild cards.
 BEVERLY / Let me get this straight. Are you saying it's a woman's game because -- because women are weak and need more help?
 WORF / (why else?) Yes.
 BEVERLY / (with a sigh) And just this afternoon I was insisting to one of the J'naii that those attitudes were nothing but a distant memory.
 WORF / (a touch of scorn) The J'naii...
 WORF / They bother me.
 TROI / Why, Worf?
 WORF / They just do.
 WORF / They are all alike. No males. No females.
 TROI / I'm sure we're just as strange to them.
 BEVERLY / Well, one of them seems to be overcoming the differences... at least with regard to one of us...
 WORF / What are you saying, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / I could be wrong... but I get the definite impression that Soren... is attracted to Commander Riker.
 WORF / A human and a J'naii? Impossible.
 DATA / (puzzled) Why?
 TROI / Good question. Worf?
 WORF / With all the wild cards, it is difficult to know exactly what is in my hand. (beat) However, I will open with... fifty.
 RIKER / The portable transporter array is in. Once we get into null space, we'll have to initialize it before we transport the J'naii crew to this shuttle. But there should still be enough power left to beam all of us back to the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Not yet. Geordi figures it'll be ready to go at oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow. (to Soren) We should adjust the engine balance before that. Can you access the starboard thrust manifold?
 RIKER / Okay, calibrate it to arc at six-point-three while I optimize the plasma flow.
 RIKER / Mmmmm?
 RIKER / (still involved in work) What's that?
 RIKER / I have to admit... I got the feeling you were different.
 RIKER / Why?
 RIKER / How long have you known you were like this?
 RIKER / And when you realized... what then?
 RIKER / Do you have... relationships... with others?
 GEORDI / Okay, Commander, everything checks out. The energy buffer is installed and functioning. I estimate it should reduce the power drain to your systems by about forty percent.
 RIKER / Any guess how long we'll have?
 GEORDI / Let just say... you don't want to waste any time once you get in there.
 GEORDI / (to Soren) You'll have to give him continuous readouts on energy consumption. I can't even predict if the drain will be at a constant rate.
 GEORDI / Then... that's it.
 GEORDI / I'll monitor you as far as I can, Commander. But once you get into that pocket -- you're on your own.
 RIKER / Since we don't know the condition of the shuttle crew, I'll beam us all directly to sickbay.
 GEORDI / I'll notify Doctor Crusher to be standing by.
 GEORDI / La Forge to bridge...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard here...
 GEORDI / We're ready to initiate shuttle prelaunch sequence.
 PICARD / Proceed, Mister Data.
 DATA / (working controls) Prelaunch sequence is underway.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Request flight clearance.
 DATA / Clearance is granted. (beat) The shuttle is underway.
 PICARD / Good hunting, Commander.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Thank you, sir. See you for dinner.
 RIKER / Heading three-five-five mark zero-one-two.
 RIKER / Acknowledged.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise. We're going in.
 RIKER / (testing) Riker to Enterprise... (beat) Riker to Enterprise...
 RIKER / Look...
 RIKER / Try hailing them...
 RIKER / I'm getting sensor readings. They're unconscious -- but they're alive. (beat) Stand by. I'm going to transport them over here.
 RIKER / The null space must be affecting the annular confinement beam...
 RIKER / We can give it one more try. More than that and we won't have enough power to get ourselves out of here.
 RIKER / Okay. Stand by to transport to the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Here we go...
 RIKER / Energy consumption?
 RIKER / If we just sit here, we'll lose all our systems within an hour -- including life support.
 RIKER / I'm rerouting the propulsion system to the transporter... (to Soren) Rechannel the navigation systems...
 RIKER / Let's transfer every microjoule of energy we've got... sensors... life support... this might give us one last shot.
 RIKER / Will explode. But if we stay here we're dead, anyway.
 RIKER / Maximum energy levels in five seconds...
 RIKER / See you in a minute.
 BEVERLY / (as she inspects them) They've been oxygen-deprived... but I don't think there's any significant damage. (to orderly) Prepare some dexalin.
 RIKER / Your colleague Soren was a great help.
 PICARD / We'd be happy to.
 RIKER / Just getting some fresh air. (beat) I can take so much of these social functions... then I need to breathe a little.
 RIKER / I was raised in the outdoors. I'm never that comfortable in crowded rooms...
 RIKER / Yes. Quite beautiful.
 RIKER / Yes, I would. I've always been interested in exobotany.
 RIKER / (rising) Thank you. It's very kind of you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45620.4. We remain in orbit of J'naii, charting the null pocket. We hope that a detailed map of the anomaly will prevent the loss of other ships.
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / Hello, Will.
 RIKER / What's all this?
 TROI / Wonderful things... my mother sent me a box that belonged to one of my father's ancestors. It had been stored on Earth years ago and just recently turned up.
 RIKER / Do you know who these people are?
 TROI / No. A few of the pictures are marked with names... but most of them aren't. I look at all these faces... and wonder who they are... if they might be related to me...
 RIKER / (playful) This one looks like you...
 RIKER / Deanna... I've got something on my mind... and I had to see you...
 TROI / Has something happened?
 RIKER / I've met someone... someone who's becoming important to me...
 TROI / Soren...
 RIKER / Yes.
 RIKER / You're my friend... so it seemed like... (beat) I'm not sure. It just seemed right to tell you.
 TROI / I'm glad you did.
 RIKER / Nothing will change between us, will it?
 TROI / Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing.
 TROI / But we will always be friends. Maybe even better friends. You're part of my life, and I'm part of yours. That much will always be true.
 GEORDI / Turns out the null pocket is even more irregular than we expected, Commander.
 RIKER / Maybe its configuration is shifting.
 GEORDI / I don't think so... the measurements you took are holding. It just has more projections than we thought. It's going to take longer than we planned to get it mapped.
 GEORDI / I'm headed for the shuttle bay. We're fitting another shuttle to help in the survey.
 RIKER / (casually) Have you made plans for dinner this evening?
 RIKER / I'd like to discuss some of our suggestions for regulating travel around the null space. Maybe we could have an early dinner... so you could still get your work done afterwards.
 RIKER / Nineteen hundred hours?
 RIKER / Hello. I'm here to see Soren...
 RIKER / We had an appointment. (beat) To discuss plans for regulating the --
 RIKER / Excuse me?
 RIKER / (worried now) Where's Soren?
 RIKER / Answer me -- where is Soren?
 RIKER / The hell there isn't.
 RIKER / Are you in charge here?
 RIKER / I think I just opened them.
 RIKER / I want you to know what really happened. It's all my fault. I was attracted to Soren. I pursued... I insisted. I didn't understand your ways until Soren told me. And rejected me. Nothing happened between us.
 RIKER / I ask your forgiveness. I behaved... inappropriately.
 RIKER / Soren --
 RIKER / No, wait... you don't have to do this...
 RIKER / Let me take her away. She can come with me, we'll give her asylum on the Enterprise. You'll never have to see her again.
 RIKER / That would solve the problem, wouldn't it? You'd be rid of her... she couldn't influence anyone else...
 RIKER / I'm just trying to find a solution that would satisfy everyone --
 RIKER / Then how is it... that Soren has no choice about her sexual orientation?
 RIKER / Did it ever occur to you she might prefer to stay the way she is?
 RIKER / She is --
 RIKER / Don't do this --
 RIKER / Soren --
 RIKER / (touching combadge) Enterprise. One to transport.
 RIKER / I can't just leave her there. They'll give her these psychotectic treatments... (beat) I don't know what to do.
 PICARD / I could talk to Noor. Perhaps there's a way to work this out --
 RIKER / (frustrated) Sir, their minds are set. They don't want to hear another solution.
 PICARD / Then I'm not sure there's much we can do.
 RIKER / There has to be.
 RIKER / My relationship with Soren isn't trivial... she's very important to me.
 RIKER / It's my fault this has happened. And I have to help her.
 PICARD / Will, if you've come here for sanction... to take matters into your own hands... I can't give it to you.
 RIKER / I know that, sir. But I know I have to do something.
 PICARD / Interfering in the internal matters of the J'naii is prohibited by the Prime Directive...
 RIKER / I'm aware of that.
 PICARD / If you violate it, you may be putting your career in jeopardy.
 PICARD / Starfleet doesn't take these matters lightly... and I can't defend you if you go too far... (beat) Do you understand that?
 RIKER / You've made yourself very clear, sir.
 PICARD / Will... don't risk everything you've worked for...
 RIKER / Thank you, sir. May I be excused now?
 RIKER / Who is it?
 WORF'S VOICE / Lieutenant Worf.
 RIKER / Come in.
 WORF / Commander, I have the plan for deploying warning buoys around the null space.
 RIKER / Fine. Just leave it, I'll look at it later.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Thank you. You're dismissed.
 WORF / Commander... I am aware of what transpired on the planet's surface...
 WORF / Are you by any chance considering an... unannounced visit?
 WORF / I will go with you.
 RIKER / (starting to protest) Lieutenant --
 WORF / Sir... you are my commanding officer... and if you order me to stay on board, I will obey. (beat) But I ask you not to give that order. A warrior does not let a friend face danger alone.
 WORF / I suggest we change clothing first.
 WORF / The meeting is ending. I think they will bring her out of the building soon.
 RIKER / Okay. They'll probably come down that path... we can take cover there -- (gesturing) -- behind those rocks.
 WORF / Yes, Commander.
 RIKER / She'll be under guard... no telling how many...
 WORF / I will handle the guards. You take her to cover.
 RIKER / Something's happening...
 RIKER / They're leaving.
 RIKER / Could you excuse us? I have to talk to her...
 RIKER / Don't worry... we'll be out of here in a minute...
 RIKER / We're almost there...
 RIKER / I won't let them hurt you. You'll be safe on the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Soren...
 RIKER / It's going to be all right... everything's going to be fine...
 RIKER / What are you talking about?
 RIKER / What... ?
 RIKER / Maybe... maybe Doctor Crusher could treat you... bring you back... to the way you were before.
 RIKER / Soren... I love you.
 PICARD / How long to the Phelan system?
 DATA / At warp six, fifty-three hours, sir.
 PICARD / Commander... ?
 RIKER / Captain.
 PICARD / Starfleet has just sent a message asking us to proceed to the Phelan system to negotiate a trade agreement.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / I wasn't sure when to tell them we'd be underway. (beat) Is our business with the J'naii finished?
 RIKER / Finished, sir.
 PICARD / Very well. Ensign, take us out of orbit, set a course for the Phelan system. Warp six. (beat) Engage.
 RIKER / Damage report!
 BEVERLY / Casualty reports coming in from all over the ship...
 DATA / (off console) The starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are venting drive plasma.
 GEORDI / Initiating emergency core shutdown.
 RIKER / (to comm) This is the bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods.
 DATA / (off console) The core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimatter containment.
 GEORDI / We've gotta eject the engine core!
 DATA / The ejection systems are off-line. A core breach is imminent...
 PICARD / (to com) All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon --
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise has entered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the first Starfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region.
 RIKER / (with humor) Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the deck.
 DATA / I assure you, Commander, the cards have been sufficiently randomized.
 WORF / I hope so.
 DATA / An eight. An Ace. A Queen. The dealer receives a four.
 WORF / No bet.
 DATA / A ten. A seven -- no help there. A pair of "ladies" for the Doctor. The dealer receives a nine. (to Beverly) Doctor, may I remind you that since you show the highest hand, you control the next bet.
 BEVERLY / I'll bet ten.
 DATA / Jack. Four. Deuce. Six.
 BEVERLY / (bets) Twenty.
 RIKER / And I'll raise you fifty.
 WORF / Fifty.
 BEVERLY / I'm in.
 DATA / I will also see the bet.
 DATA / (dealing) Seven... and a possible straight for Commander Riker. Jack -- still no help for the Klingon.
 DATA / (continuing) Eight. Nine for the dealer.
 BEVERLY / Twenty.
 DATA / (folds) "Too rich for my blood."
 RIKER / I'll see your twenty -- and raise you a hundred.
 WORF / Fold.
 BEVERLY / And two hundred more.
 RIKER / Two. And another three hundred.
 WORF / He does not have the straight.
 BEVERLY / We'll find out, won't we?
 BEVERLY / Let's see what you've got.
 RIKER / Take it.
 RIKER / (to Beverly) How'd you know I was bluffing?
 BEVERLY / I just had a feeling.
 RIKER / I guess it's better to be lucky than good.
 BEVERLY / Or maybe it's the way your left eyebrow raises slightly when you bluff.
 BEVERLY / Just teasing, Commander.
 BEVERLY / Go ahead.
 BEVERLY / On my way.
 GEORDI / At first I thought the catwalk was spinning. Turns out it was me. (beat) I'm lucky Ensign Fletcher was there to grab me -- it's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core.
 BEVERLY / You have all the symptoms of an inner-ear infection. That would explain your dizziness... and the headache.
 BEVERLY / But I don't see any physical evidence. (beat) My guess is... you've been working too hard.
 GEORDI / I have been putting in extra hours on the Typhon Expanse survey.
 BEVERLY / I'll give you twenty cc's of vertazine -- it'll clear up your dizziness. But finding time to relax is up to you...
 GEORDI / (off her look) What is it?
 BEVERLY / Geordi... have you ever had these symptoms before?
 GEORDI / (thinks) Never.
 BEVERLY / You're sure?
 GEORDI / Positive. Why?
 BEVERLY / It's funny... I get the feeling that we've discussed these complaints. (beat) I remember giving you a hypospray for dizziness.
 GEORDI / I've never had these symptoms before today. You must be remembering some other patient.
 BEVERLY / No. I'm sure it was you.
 BEVERLY / Try to get some rest. And stay away from high places for a few days, just in case.
 GEORDI / Thanks, Doc.
 BEVERLY / Goodnight.
 GEORDI / The Typhon Expanse is huge. If we want to chart the most remote star system, we'll have to launch a probe within the next few hours.
 RIKER / Fine. (consults PADD) What about the luminosity studies?
 GEORDI / They may pose a problem...
 PICARD / How so?
 GEORDI / The flux spectrometers are still down for realignment.
 RIKER / I thought they were supposed to be back on-line yesterday.
 GEORDI / They were, until the stellar dynamics lab decided they needed to install new modules.
 DATA / I recommend we use the gravitron polarimeter instead. It will perform a similar function.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 BEVERLY / Captain... There's something I'd like to report.
 PICARD / Yes, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / I heard... voices in my room last night. I was alone... so at first I thought I was imagining things. But this morning, ten other people reported hearing them at the same time I did.
 TROI / What were the voices saying?
 BEVERLY / I couldn't make them out...
 RIKER / Data, did the sensors pick up anything unusual last night?
 DATA / No anomalous readings were reported.
 RIKER / When we're through here, double-check the sensor logs.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 PICARD / Counselor?
 TROI / I sensed nothing out of the ordinary last night.
 GEORDI / Maybe it's a problem with the com system.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We are getting unusual readings -- twenty thousand kilometers off the port bow.
 PICARD / Report.
 WORF / (off console) It is a highly localized distortion in the space-time continuum.
 RIKER / On screen.
 PICARD / Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.
 DATA / (off console) The distortion field is fluctuating.
 GEORDI / All main systems just went down. Power levels dropping rapidly...
 RIKER / Red Alert.
 DATA / There is an energy build-up in the distortion field. (beat) Something is emerging...
 TROI / (certain) Captain -- we have to get out of here now.
 RIKER / Shields up! Evasive maneuvers!
 WORF / Shields inoperative!
 DATA / The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty-six seconds...
 PICARD / Hail them.
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / Suggestions?
 RIKER / Decompress the main shuttlebay -- the explosive reaction might kick us out of the way.
 DATA / Captain -- I recommend we use the tractor beam to alter the other ship's trajectory.
 PICARD / Mister Worf -- make it so.
 WORF / (working) Engaging tractor beam...
 RIKER / Damage report!
 BEVERLY / Casualty reports coming in from all over the ship...

 BEVERLY / Do you recall when?
 GEORDI / No, I don't.
 BEVERLY / (certain) We've had this discussion. I remember giving you this examination... (beat) Let's check the medical logs.
 BEVERLY / (off console) You've been treated several times for headaches related to your VISOR... but I see no mention of dizziness.
 GEORDI / (lightly) Must be deja-vu.
 BEVERLY / Both of us -- about the same thing?
 BEVERLY / Crusher to Captain Picard.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc... do you have a minute?
 PICARD / (re: cup) My Aunt Adele cured a lot of sleepless nights with this steamed milk.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 BEVERLY / Mmm... nutmeg.
 PICARD / Every time I get insomnia, I try to perfect the recipe.
 BEVERLY / It was the eeriest feeling. When the glass broke, it triggered the same sensation even more intensely -- that I had done it all before.
 PICARD / Earlier, when I was reading this book... I had the distinct feeling I'd read certain paragraphs before. (beat) I just assumed I'd read the book years ago and forgotten.
 BEVERLY / I've been having this feeling for hours. (beat) And then those voices...
 PICARD / Do you feel like we've had this conversation before?
 BEVERLY / No. None of this seems familiar.
 PICARD / This could be nothing more than a restless night. But let's be sure... Call Geordi and Data. I want you to run a shipwide diagnostic, concentrating on the time and place you heard the voices. (beat) We'll discuss the results tomorrow at oh seven hundred hours.
 BEVERLY / Thank you, Jean-Luc. (re: the milk) For everything.
 PICARD / Thank Aunt Adele.
 DATA / The internal scans were negative. There was no evidence of auditory anomalies anywhere on the ship.
 GEORDI / As far as the sensors are concerned, nothing unusual happened last night.
 BEVERLY / Before I came up here, ten other people reported hearing voices at the same time I did.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We are getting unusual readings -- twenty thousand kilometers off the port bow.
 PICARD / Report.
 WORF / (off console) It is a highly localized distortion in the space-time continuum.
 RIKER / On screen.
 PICARD / Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.
 DATA / The distortion field is fluctuating.
 GEORDI / All main systems just went down. Power levels dropping rapidly...
 RIKER / Red Alert.
 DATA / There is an energy build-up in the distortion field. (beat) Something is emerging...
 TROI / (certain) Captain -- we have to get out of here now.
 RIKER / Shields up! Evasive maneuvers!
 WORF / Shields inoperative!
 DATA / The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty-six seconds...
 PICARD / Hail them.
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / Suggestions?
 RIKER / Decompress the main shuttlebay -- the explosive reaction might kick us out of the way.
 DATA / Captain -- I recommend we use the tractor beam to alter the other ship's trajectory.
 PICARD / Mister Worf -- make it so.
 WORF / Engaging tractor beam...
 RIKER / Damage report!
 BEVERLY / Casualty reports coming in from all over the ship...
 DATA / The starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are venting drive plasma.
 GEORDI / Initiating emergency core shutdown.
 RIKER / (to com) This is the bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods.
 DATA / The core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimatter containment.
 GEORDI / We've gotta eject the engine core!
 DATA / The ejection systems are off-line. A core breach is imminent...
 PICARD / (to comm) All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon --
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise has entered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the first Starfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region.
 RIKER / (with humor) Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the deck.
 DATA / I assure you, Commander, the cards have been sufficiently randomized.
 WORF / I hope so.
 RIKER / (off his look) Something wrong, Worf?
 WORF / I am experiencing nIb'poH. (beat) The feeling I have done this before.
 RIKER / (with humor) Yeah -- last Tuesday night.
 WORF / That is not what I mean.
 BEVERLY / (off his remark) I've been feeling the same way...
 BEVERLY / Data.... keep dealing.
 DATA / An eight. An Ace...
 BEVERLY / (cutting in) A Queen. I'm going to get a Queen.
 BEVERLY / And you're going to get a four...
 BEVERLY / Deal the cards.
 DATA / But nobody has bet.
 BEVERLY / Forget the bet. Deal.
 BEVERLY / Ten... Seven... Queen...
 WORF / Nine... Jack... Four...
 RIKER / Deuce... Six...
 DATA / This is highly improbable.
 RIKER / How did we know...
 BEVERLY / Wait.
 BEVERLY / (taps communicator) Crusher to sickbay.
 BEVERLY / Is Commander La Forge there?
 PICARD / (to Beverly) You wanted to see me, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Yes...
 BEVERLY / Captain... have you been getting the feeling that you've experienced certain things before? A sense of... repetition?
 PICARD / Yes... recently. While I was reading. Why do you ask?
 BEVERLY / There have been similar incidents reported all over the ship. Feelings of deja-vu. (beat) And now this...
 BEVERLY / I had a premonition Geordi was going to come in to sickbay. A few seconds later, he did -- with the symptoms of an ear infection. (beat) I was going to run all the standard tests... but somehow I knew they were going to be negative. So I ran an optical diagnostic... which traced the problem to Geordi's VISOR...
 BEVERLY / His dizziness is being caused by a phase-shift in his visual receptors. It's causing him to see images that aren't there...
 GEORDI / They're like... blurry afterimages.
 BEVERLY / I ran a scan to see if I could detect what he was seeing. I picked up miniscule distortions in the surrounding dekyon field. (beat) Somehow, his VISOR seems to be translating those distortions into visual impulses.
 GEORDI / It could be a malfunction in the ship's warp field generator. I'll check it out.
 PICARD / While you're at it, run a localized subspace scan to look for anything unusual.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Keep me advised.
 BEVERLY / (taps communicator) Crusher to Commander La Forge.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here.
 BEVERLY / I just heard what sounded like... voices in my room. But there's no one here.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Sensors just picked up something strange, too. We're checking it out...
 BEVERLY / I'm on my way down.
 GEORDI / (off console) Looks like you managed to record six point two seconds worth. (beat) Let's see if we can filter the signal and clear it up a little.
 BEVERLY / So I wasn't just hearing things?
 DATA / The sound itself appears to have been real. However the acoustic energy does not correspond to any ship's system, nor to any voice communications sent at the time you heard it.
 BEVERLY / Then where did the sound come from?
 GEORDI / You heard the voices at the same time our localized subspace scan picked up a another dekyon field distortion. The two may be related.
 GEORDI / Let's take another listen...
 DATA / Computer -- perform a narrow bandwidth analysis. Eliminate all nonvocal waveform components.
 BEVERLY / Can we isolate the voices... find out what they're saying?
 DATA / I will attempt to distinguish the individual voices. (beat) Computer -- continuous playback.
 DATA / (over the noise) There seem to be approximately one thousand human voices overlapping. (beat) The voices are those of the Enterprise crew. (beat) Our voices.
 BEVERLY / (to all) I'm sorry to call you here so early. But we couldn't wait until oh seven hundred hours. (beat) We think we may have an explanation for the odd occurrences around here...
 GEORDI / This is going to sound pretty wild... (beat) Somehow, we've entered what seems to be a temporal causality loop.
 GEORDI / (re: diagram) We think we're stuck in a particular fragment of time. And we've been experiencing that same fragment over and over again.
 TROI / (tentative) Is this what's causing our deja-vu?
 BEVERLY / Yes, but it's more than that. In deja-vu, you only think you're repeating events. We actually are.
 GEORDI / Our theory is this -- every time the loop begins again, everything resets itself, and starts all over. We don't remember anything that happened before... so each time through the loop, we think it's the first.
 RIKER / You mean, maybe we've come into this room, sat at this table and had this conversation a dozen times already?
 GEORDI / A dozen... a hundred... It's impossible to tell. Maybe we've been trapped here for hours... days... maybe years.
 BEVERLY / If what we're saying is true -- those voices I heard might've been "echoes" from previous loops.
 GEORDI / The same thing with the phase-shift in my VISOR -- afterimages in time.
 PICARD / If you are correct... how did it happen? How did we get here?
 DATA / I have a hypothesis which may explain that, Captain. (beat) I have analyzed the recording Doctor Crusher made. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / Most of it is quite ordinary. One hundred twenty-five discussions about ship operations, two hundred fifty-seven conversations of a personal nature, five couples engaged in romantic encounters...
 PICARD / Your point, Mister Data?
 DATA / There is evidence of some sort of disaster involving the Enterprise -- severe enough that the captain would order all hands to abandon ship. I have isolated three segments of the recording which are crucial.
 WORF (V.O.) / ... a highly localized distortion...
 DATA (V.O.) / ... collision course. Impact in thirty-six seconds...
 PICARD (V.O.) / ... hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon...
 TROI / The phrase "collision course" suggests we collided with something.
 GEORDI / (nods) Worf refers to a "distortion." If this were a temporal distortion, and if we were close enough to it... it's possible that a large enough explosion might've ruptured the space-time continuum. (beat) We collided... exploded... and got stuck in this repeating loop of time.
 PICARD / If you're right about this... perhaps we could escape the loop by avoiding the collision...
 GEORDI / That's our guess.
 WORF / Maybe we should reverse course.
 RIKER / For all we know, reversing course might be what leads us into the crash.
 PICARD / We can't afford to start second-guessing ourselves. We'll stay on our present course until we have reason to change it. (beat) In the meantime, let's do everything we can to avoid a collision.
 GEORDI / Captain... We may not find out how to avoid this accident until it's too late. And if the loop begins again -- we'll forget everything we've learned this time around.
 PICARD / What do you suggest?
 GEORDI / If we do find a way to avoid the collision... we should try to send that information into the next loop.
 RIKER / Is that possible?
 DATA / We have seen that echoes, or afterimages, from previous loops appear as distortions in the dekyon field. We may be able to send a deliberate echo into the next loop.
 TROI / Like a message in a bottle...
 GEORDI / Exactly. We could enhance a dekyon emission to create a specific pattern... and send ourselves a message. Not a long one -- probably only a few characters... maybe one word...
 RIKER / How do we know we'll pick up that word the next time through?
 DATA / If the dekyon emission is modulated correctly, it would set up a resonance in my positronic subprocessors. I would receive the information -- on what you would call a subconscious level.
 GEORDI / That's the catch. We're not sure how the information will be perceived by Data... it might be almost like a posthypnotic suggestion.
 PICARD / Even with all these uncertainties, we've got to try. (to Geordi and Data) Take whatever steps are necessary to send a message. (beat) Dismissed.
 GEORDI / It's possible we've tried this a thousand times and it's never worked.
 BEVERLY / Do you have the feeling you've done it before?
 GEORDI / (thinks) No, I don't.
 BEVERLY / Neither do I. Maybe that's a good sign.
 GEORDI / (re: device) Let's test the emitter.
 DATA / Particle accelerators to full power.
 GEORDI / Dekyon field active... particle flux nominal... (beat) We're in business.
 BEVERLY / All we need now is a message.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Senior staff report to the bridge.
 BEVERLY / On our way.
 RIKER / How do you think we might've handled this before?
 PICARD / Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.
 DATA / (off console) The distortion field is fluctuating.
 GEORDI / All main systems just went down. Power levels dropping rapidly...
 DATA / There is an energy build-up in the distortion field. (beat) Something is emerging...
 TROI / (certain) Captain -- we have to get out of here now.

 BEVERLY / (off his remark) I've been feeling the same way...
 BEVERLY / Wait.
 BEVERLY / An eight... an Ace... a Queen... a four... (beat) Deal the cards, Data.
 BEVERLY / I was positive I knew what cards were going to be dealt...
 WORF / I was also sure.
 RIKER / Finish the deal, Data.
 BEVERLY / We all got three's... then three-of-a-kind?
 BEVERLY / Go ahead.
 BEVERLY / On my way.
 GEORDI / At first I thought the catwalk was spinning. Turns out it was me. (beat) I'm lucky Ensign Fletcher was there to grab me -- it's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core.
 BEVERLY / You have all the symptoms of an inner-ear infection. That would explain your dizziness... and the headache.
 BEVERLY / But I don't see any physical...
 GEORDI / (off her look) What is it?
 BEVERLY / Geordi... have you ever had these symptoms before?
 GEORDI / (thinks) Now that you mention it... I think I did.
 BEVERLY / Do you recall when?
 GEORDI / No, I don't.
 BEVERLY / (certain) We've had this discussion. I remember giving you this examination... (beat) Let's check the medical logs.
 BEVERLY / (off console) You've been treated several times for headaches related to your VISOR... but I see no mention of dizziness.
 GEORDI / (lightly) Must be deja-vu.
 BEVERLY / Both of us -- about the same thing?
 BEVERLY / Let's run an optical diagnostic.
 GEORDI / For an ear infection?
 BEVERLY / I've got a hunch...
 BEVERLY / Hold still... this pulse may be a little bright...
 BEVERLY / (off instrument) That's odd... (beat) Have you made any changes to your VISOR lately?
 GEORDI / No. Why?
 BEVERLY / I'm detecting a slight phase-shift in your visual receptors...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Yes, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Can you come to sickbay immediately? It's urgent.
 PICARD / On my way.
 BEVERLY / (re: Geordi) His dizziness is being caused by a phase-shift in his visual receptors. It's causing him to see images that aren't there...

 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Keep me advised.
 GEORDI / Lateral sensors on-line -- subspace scanners active... (beat) Data, will you run a level two diagnostic on the warp subsystems?
 DATA / Certainly.
 GEORDI / All three's... that can't be right.
 DATA / I have encountered the numeral "three" an inordinate number of times over the last two hours.
 GEORDI / We've got a dekyon field fluctuation on deck nine, section twenty-eight...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Commander La Forge.
 GEORDI / La Forge here.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I just heard what sounded like... voices in my room. But there's no one here.
 GEORDI / Sensors just picked up something strange, too. We're checking it out...
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I'm on my way down.
 GEORDI / Are you alright, Doctor?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I'm fine.
 WORF (V.O.) / ... a highly localized distortion...
 DATA (V.O.) / ... collision course. Impact in thirty-six seconds...
 PICARD (V.O.) / ... hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon...
 TROI / The phrase "collision course" suggests we collided with something.
 GEORDI / (nods) Worf refers to a "distortion." If this were a temporal distortion, and if we were close enough to it... it's possible that a large enough explosion might've ruptured the space-time continuum. (beat) We collided... exploded... and got stuck in this repeating loop of time.
 PICARD / If you're right about this... Perhaps we could escape the loop by avoiding the collision.
 GEORDI / That's our guess.
 WORF / Maybe we should reverse course.
 RIKER / For all we know, reversing course might be what leads us into the crash.
 PICARD / We can't afford to start second-guessing ourselves. We'll stay on our present course until we have reason to change it. (beat) In the meantime, let's do everything we can to avoid a collision.
 GEORDI / Captain... We've been seeing the number three all over the ship. On consoles... in a poker game...
 DATA / In total, we have encountered two thousand eighty-five conspicuous examples of the number "three."
 GEORDI / All these "threes" can't be coming up by accident.
 RIKER / Maybe somebody's trying to tell us something.
 GEORDI / We came to the same conclusion... so we ran a shipwide diagnostic -- the only unusual thing we found was a dekyon field modulation in Data's positronic subprocessors.
 BEVERLY / What could be causing it?
 GEORDI / I don't know. But if I wanted to send information from one loop to the next... I might have used a method like a dekyon emission.
 TROI / You think we sent ourselves a message?
 GEORDI / It would make sense. Maybe we were trying to tell ourselves something...
 PICARD / If that were true... what could "three" indicate?
 RIKER / Maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems.
 GEORDI / Good idea. And I'll have the computer run a pattern-matching algorithm based on the number three.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 PICARD / Red Alert.
 PICARD / Report.
 WORF / (off console) It is a highly localized distortion in the space-time continuum.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / How do you think we might've handled this before?
 PICARD / Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.
 DATA / (off console) The distortion field is fluctuating.
 GEORDI / All main systems just went down. Power levels dropping rapidly...
 DATA / There is an energy build-up in the distortion field. (beat) Something is emerging...
 TROI / (certain) Captain -- we have to get out of here now.
 RIKER / Shields up! Evasive maneuvers!
 WORF / Shields inoperative!
 DATA / The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty-six seconds...
 PICARD / Hail them.
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / Suggestions?
 RIKER / Decompress the main shuttlebay -- the explosive reaction might kick us out of the way.
 DATA / Captain -- I recommend we use the tractor beam to alter the other ship's trajectory.
 PICARD / Mister Worf -- make it so.
 WORF / Engaging tractor beam...
 DATA / The tractor beam will not be successful. I am decompressing the main shuttlebay...
 WORF / We are clear of the distortion, Captain.
 PICARD / Data -- what happened?
 DATA / At the last moment, I speculated that "three" might refer to the number of rank insignia on Commander Riker's uniform. (beat) This indicated to me that his suggestion was the correct course of action.
 GEORDI / (to Data) You must've picked up a message we sent from the last loop... and stacked the deck in the poker game without realizing it.
 DATA / That is possible, Commander. I may also have been inadvertently responsible for the unexplained appearances of the number "three."
 PICARD / Mister Worf, end Red Alert. See if you can access a Federation time-base beacon. Find out how long we've been in this causality loop.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WORF / (off console) Time-base confirms that our chronometers are off by seventeen point four days.
 PICARD / Reset them, Mister Data.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 WORF / Captain -- we are being hailed by the other vessel. (off console) The computer identifies it as the U.S.S. Bozeman. A Federation starship, Soyuz class.
 GEORDI / (reacts) Soyuz Class... they haven't been in service for over eighty years.
 PICARD / Open a channel.
 PICARD / Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We were just going to ask you the same thing.
 PICARD / Have you any idea what just happened?
 PICARD / The Enterprise has been caught in temporal causality loop. And I suspect something similar happened to you.
 PICARD / Captain Bateson... do you know what year it is?
 PICARD / Captain... perhaps you should beam aboard our ship. (beat) There's something we need to discuss.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45703.9. We are en route to Earth, where it will be my pleasant duty to deliver this year's commencement address at Starfleet Academy. I'm also looking forward to seeing Wesley Crusher again. His flight team will perform a demonstration near Saturn that will be transmitted to the graduation ceremonies.
 PICARD, TROI and RIKER are at their seats; WORF is / at tactical, DATA at ops.
 WORF / Captain, Starfleet Academy is requesting an update on our estimated arrival.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / (off console) We should arrive at Earth in ten hours, sixteen minutes, sir.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Please inform the Academy and send my regards to Superintendant Brand.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 TROI / (to Picard) Do you know Admiral Brand?
 PICARD / We've met a few times. She's a... formidable woman.
 RIKER / (ruefully) If she's anything like my superintendent... (off Picard's look) When I was at the Academy, we had a Vulcan superintendent who memorized the personnel file of every single cadet. He knew everything. It was like having your parents there with you. All the time.
 PICARD / My superintendent was a Betazoid -- a full telepath. When he called you into his office, he didn't have to ask what you'd done.
 RIKER / (very curious) You got called into the superintendent's office? That sounds like a story I'd like to hear.
 WORF / Captain, we are being hailed by the Academy again. It is Admiral Brand.
 PICARD / On-screen.
 WORF / Sir, she is requesting a private channel.
 PICARD / In my ready room.
 PICARD / Admiral Brand... what can I do for you?
 PICARD / Yes... ?
 PICARD / ... he had second degree burns on his chest and a multiple fracture of his right arm. But he's going to be fine.
 BEVERLY / Have they completed the regeneration series?
 PICARD / I'm... not certain.
 BEVERLY / Wesley's allergic to metorapan treatments... they'll have to use a bicaridine substitute.
 PICARD / Beverly...
 BEVERLY / I should send his complete records to the Academy infirmary... They probably have them already, but it never hurts to be sure. I'll also send them some information on a new rybotherapy I've been working on.
 PICARD / Beverly... (she looks up at him) He's fine.
 BEVERLY / I know he's fine... I know he's fine. Let's talk about something else. (ignoring her own advice) How did it happen?
 PICARD / Apparently, Wesley's squadron was practicing on the Academy flight range near Saturn... they were in close formation when there was a collision... all five ships were destroyed. (beat) Four of the cadets managed to transport out... one did not.
 BEVERLY / Do you know who it was?
 PICARD / His name was Joshua Albert.
 BEVERLY / Wesley talked about him... They were friends...
 BEVERLY / Wesley was so excited about making the flight team... it made me a little nervous, but I was proud of him... (difficult) ... even though I knew there was always the chance that... something might...
 PICARD / (firmly) Beverly. Wesley is alive and well.
 PICARD / Admiral Brand will be holding a full briefing after we arrive. I'll let you know as soon as we're in orbit.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 PICARD / It's an unhappy way to begin commencement. If you require any assistance, Admiral, the Enterprise is at your disposal.
 BEVERLY / Commander Albert?
 BEVERLY / Hello, I'm Beverly Crusher. I just wanted to say... I'm sorry about your son.
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 BEVERLY / If there's anything I can do...
 BEVERLY / Wes.
 WESLEY / Hi.
 PICARD / How are you feeling, Wesley?
 WESLEY / Not too bad... the arm's still a little sore.
 BEVERLY / (gently) We were so sorry to hear about Joshua.
 PICARD / Would you like to talk about it... ?
 WESLEY / No. I don't think so. Thank you.
 WESLEY / I know you're trying to help, sir... but it seems like I haven't talked about anything else for the past two days. I don't want to go over it all again.
 PICARD / I understand. But I want you to know I'm available if you should change your mind.
 BEVERLY / All your friends on the Enterprise wanted you to know they're thinking about you... Commander Riker, Data, Robin Lefler... everybody.
 WESLEY / That's nice.
 WESLEY / Come in.
 PICARD / At ease, Cadet.
 WESLEY / This is my squadron leader, Nicholas Locarno... This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise... my mother, Doctor Beverly Crusher.
 PICARD / (shakes his hand) Mister Locarno.
 BEVERLY / How are you doing, Nicholas?
 PICARD / (sympathetically) I'm afraid it doesn't get any easier.
 WESLEY / Excuse me, Mom, Captain... but Nick and I have some things to talk about.
 BEVERLY / Of course.
 BEVERLY / If you need anything at all...
 WESLEY / I know.
 PICARD / We'll see you at the inquiry. (to Locarno) Good to meet you, Mister Locarno.
 WESLEY / (unsure) I think so.
 PICARD / Boothby?
 PICARD / (prompting) Jean-Luc Picard... class of twenty-seven.
 PICARD / How are you?
 PICARD / Let me give you a hand...
 PICARD / I've acquired an interest over the years.
 PICARD / -- will rot...
 PICARD / Something wrong, Cadet?
 PICARD / You sound... surprised...
 PICARD / (grins at the memory) Was all in the legs... from all the running I used to do...
 PICARD / Boothby...
 PICARD / I don't know that I've ever really told you... how much... I appreciate...
 PICARD / Yes, there is... I just wanted to... while I was here... (beat) You know as well as I do I would never have made it to graduation if you hadn't...
 PICARD / Nevertheless, you...
 PICARD / At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious old man.
 PICARD / I didn't speak to you for months.
 PICARD / Did you know the boy from Nova Squadron who was killed?
 BEVERLY / (sotto) What's wrong?
 PICARD / (sotto) It's unusual to fly on sensors alone in that type of maneuver. A pilot relies on the visual cues from the other ships to maintain formation.
 GEORDI / (dubious) Captain, the Academy has one of the best reconstructive analysis labs in Starfleet. I'm not sure we'll have much to contribute to the investigation.
 PICARD / That may well be the case. However... (softer) Wesley is one of our own.
 GEORDI / Understood, sir. We'll get right on it.
 PICARD / Good. I've spoken with Admiral Brand and she has agreed to allow us access to all of the physical evidence and testimony.
 PICARD / Thank you, gentlemen.
 DATA / (to com) Computer, initiate a link between this station and the Starfleet Academy Database.
 WESLEY / You said we wouldn't have to lie to them. We all agreed not to lie to them.
 WESLEY / The accident was not Josh's fault.
 WESLEY / We don't know that...
 WESLEY / Nick... I don't think I can do this.
 WESLEY / Sir.
 WESLEY / No, sir. I was just going over my deposition for tomorrow.
 WESLEY / The ski trip... (looks at Albert) We went to Calgary last month... Josh forgot his sweater... so he borrowed one of mine.
 WESLEY / A little... he only needed help with statistical mechanics.
 WESLEY / He could do it... (smile) He just didn't like to.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 WESLEY / This is the beginning of our run toward Titan. I'm on the right wing.
 WESLEY / He was on my port quarter, about fifty meters away.
 WESLEY / We just received the signal to begin the diamond slot formation. That's Cadet Locarno coming into view.
 WESLEY (o.c.) / We're in a twenty degree turn, coming around Titan...
 WESLEY / We should be coming out of Titan's gravity well about now...
 WESLEY / Once we'd cleared the moon... Mister Locarno led us into a Yeager loop... about nine seconds later, everything seemed to happen at once: the proximity alarm went off, I tried to veer away, but it was too late... I was hit... I lost control of the ship and a power coupling exploded in the cockpit... I don't know how, but I managed to activate my escape transporter... the next thing I remember was finding myself in the emergency evac station on Mimas with the rest of the squadron... except Josh.
 WESLEY / No, sir.
 WESLEY / (demonstrates with hands) The ships begin in a diamond slot formation. They climb and loop backwards at a steep angle... at the peak of the loop, all five ships flip over and accelerate in a new direction.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir.
 WESLEY / No, sir.
 WESLEY / I have none.
 BEVERLY / Everything's going to be okay, Wes. There's got to be an explanation for all this.
 BEVERLY / Data and Geordi are already analyzing the flight recorder and the satellite transmission.
 WESLEY / Why?
 BEVERLY / There must be something wrong with the satellite data... it might have been tampered with...
 WESLEY / Mom... that doesn't make any sense...
 BEVERLY / Well there has to be some explanation... I know you're telling the truth... but that satellite data made it look like you were lying.
 BEVERLY / I've spoken with the other parents... (MORE)
 BEVERLY (cont'd) / (beat) I'm going to go to Admiral Brand and ask that she delay the inquiry for at least--
 WESLEY / (firmly) Mom. No. (beat) You can't do that.
 BEVERLY / (determined) I'm not going to let them destroy your career, Wes... you haven't done anything wrong.
 WESLEY / Don't try to protect me, Mom... Please just... stay out of it.
 PICARD / (dry) You could use a good herbicide instead of crawling about on your hands and knees pulling weeds.
 PICARD / Boothby... tell me more about Nova Squadron.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / That final game against Minsk...
 PICARD / We had a lot to celebrate. Our team wasn't supposed to win. (beat) We were proud of them...
 BEVERLY / He all but admitted to me that he was lying.
 PICARD / What exactly did he say?
 BEVERLY / He just asked me not to help him... but it was the way he said it ... the look on his face... Jean-Luc, I know my son, and he's in trouble.
 PICARD / Report.
 GEORDI / Nothing conclusive.
 GEORDI / We do know the collision occurred about four seconds after the satellite images were recorded. But we still don't know how the ships got into the new formation or how the crash occurred.
 DATA / We have unsuccessfully tried over fifty different computational models in an effort to simulate the movements of Nova Squadron just prior to the crash.
 GEORDI / There're just too many variables to take into consideration... speed, attitude, course...
 PICARD / Did Wesley's flight recorder indicate there was anything... unusual about the ship or the way it was operating?
 GEORDI / Well, the starboard power flow was fluctuating.
 DATA / However, it was well within operational limits.
 GEORDI / (thinking) The fluidic pressure in the landing struts was low, but I don't know what difference that would make.
 DATA / (thinks) We did find that Wesley had opened his coolant interlock just before beginning the maneuver around Titan.
 GEORDI / Which is a little unusual. The interlock is normally closed unless you're performing a check on the engine coolant levels. But there's no evidence Wesley was running that kind of check.
 PICARD / (musing) Filling the primary coolant tanks requires an open interlock... but that can only be done in a maintenance bay. What other reasons are there to open that valve?
 GEORDI / It's the first step in purging the plasma exhaust.
 DATA / (objecting) That procedure would be extremely hazardous while the ship was in flight.
 GEORDI / Yeah, the engine would probably ignite the plasma.
 PICARD / Ignite the plasma... that's exactly what they were trying to do.
 PICARD / Come.
 WESLEY / Captain.
 PICARD / Can you tell me what maneuver this is?
 WESLEY / It's the Kolvoord Starburst.
 PICARD / Five ships crossing within ten meters of each other and then igniting their plasma trails. One of the most difficult and spectacular demonstrations of precision flying. It hasn't been performed by an Academy team in over a century. Do you know why?
 WESLEY / It was banned by the Academy following a training accident.
 PICARD / An accident in which all five cadets lost their lives. (beat) Nicholas Locarno wanted to end his Academy career in a blaze of glory... so he convinced the four of you to learn the Kolvoord Starburst for the commencement demonstration. If it worked, you'd thrill the assembled guests... and Locarno would graduate as a living legend. Except it didn't work... and Joshua Albert paid the price.
 PICARD / Am I correct?
 PICARD / (hard) I asked you a question, Cadet.
 WESLEY / (stiffly) I... choose not to answer, sir.
 PICARD / You choose not to answer... and yet you've already given an answer to the inquiry... and that answer was a lie.
 WESLEY / I said the accident occurred after the loop, and it did.
 PICARD / (hard) But you neglected to mention the fact that following the loop your team executed a dangerous maneuver which was the direct cause of the crash. (beat) Yes, you told the truth... but only to a point. And a lie of omission is still a lie.
 PICARD / Do you remember the day you first came aboard this ship? Your mother brought you to the bridge...
 WESLEY / Yes.
 PICARD / You even sat in my chair. It annoyed me at first... a presumptuous child playing on my ship. But I never forgot the way you knew every control and display before you ever set foot on the bridge. You acted like you belonged there.
 WESLEY / (quiet) I remember.
 PICARD / Later... when I decided to make you an acting ensign, I was convinced you would be an outstanding officer. I've never questioned that conviction... until now.
 PICARD / The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth... be it scientific truth, historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon which Starfleet is based. If you cannot find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened... you do not deserve to wear that uniform.
 PICARD / Mister Crusher... I'll make this simple for you. Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place... or I will.
 WESLEY / Captain...
 PICARD / Dismissed.
 WESLEY / They know, Nick. They know what we did.
 WESLEY / Captain Picard called me to the Enterprise... when I got there he said he'd figured it out... the Kolvoord manuever, the cover-up, everything. He said that if I didn't come forward now and tell the truth... he would.
 WESLEY / No... but he still knew exactly what happened.
 WESLEY / You're asking me to call Captain Picard a liar.
 WESLEY / (quiet) It's wrong...
 WESLEY / (hard) No. I'm going to tell them what happened.
 WESLEY / I'm not going to lie to them again, Nick... I can't live with it.
 WESLEY / (shocked) Nick...
 WESLEY / Hey, wait a minute...
 WESLEY / We're Starfleet cadets, we have a duty to the truth.
 WESLEY / Nick, if we all come forward together... tell Admiral Brand---
 WESLEY / You'd let me do it, wouldn't you? You'd let me throw my career away just to save your neck.
 WESLEY / (to Brand) Sir... I would like to add something to my testimony.
 WESLEY / Yesterday, I testified that the crash occurred following a Yeager loop. That's not entirely true. (beat) We did perform the loop. But after that, we broke formation... and attempted a Kolvoord Starburst.
 WESLEY / We knew it was prohibited and that it would be dangerous, but we wanted to do something spectacular for the commencement demonstration... So we pushed Josh... and he wasn't ready. We thought we could do it... we thought we could do anything. We were wrong... and Josh died.
 WESLEY / Josh didn't let us down, sir. It wasn't his fault.
 PICARD / Mister Locarno has been expelled.
 WESLEY / (bitter) They should've expelled all of us.
 PICARD / They almost did. But... Mister Locarno made an impassioned plea for the rest of you. He said he used his influence as squadron leader to convince you all to try the Kolvoord maneuver and then to cover up the truth. He asked to take full responsibility.
 WESLEY / (a sad laugh) He did exactly what he said he would -- he protected the team. (beat) I feel awful... I've let everybody down... my friends, Mom, you.
 PICARD / You should feel bad... and you will pay for what you did. Admiral Brand has decided that, in addition to a formal reprimand, your academic credits for the past year will be cancelled and you will not advance with your class.
 WESLEY / I understand.
 PICARD / It won't be easy... staying here on campus with everyone knowing what you did... I think you have some rough times ahead.
 WESLEY / Yes, sir. (beat, heartfelt) Captain... thank you.
 PICARD / (echoing Boothby's words) You knew what you had to do... I just made sure you listened to yourself. (beat) Good-bye, Cadet.
 WESLEY / Good-bye, Captain.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, and WORF; N.D.s as needed. The / atmosphere on the bridge is tense -- they're in the middle of a pursuit and racing against a clock. Red alert is already on.
 WORF / Forward tubes armed and ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Fire.
 WORF / A direct hit, sir.
 DATA / The asteroid has shattered. However, the core is still intact -- and still on a direct collision course with Tessen Three.
 RIKER / Is it big enough to be a threat?
 DATA / Yes, sir. It is of sufficient size and density to cause planetwide damage.
 PICARD / Time to impact.
 DATA / It will reach the upper atmosphere in forty-four seconds and impact with the planet eleven seconds later.
 RIKER / Ready torpedoes.
 DATA / Sir, the core is composed of densely compressed nitrium and chrondite. It is unlikely that another photon torpedo will have any effect on it.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, prepare the tractor beam.
 WORF / Yes, Captain.
 DATA / Time to impact is thirty seconds.
 WORF / Sir, I cannot get a positive lock with the tractor beam. There is magnetic field interference emanating from the core materials.
 PICARD / Suggestions?
 DATA / If we project a particle beam through the deflector dish, we may be able to produce a disruptive nuclear effect in the core.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 WORF / The target has been destroyed, sir.
 DATA / The largest piece of remaining debris offers no threat to the planet.
 PICARD / Well done. Ensign, put us back on course for the Moselina system. Warp four as soon as we've cleared the debris field.
 WORF and his son ALEXANDER sit stiffly -- side by side / but separated by their anger at each other -- venting it all before a patient TROI.
 WORF / My instructions were clear!
 WORF / Before being allowed to play, he was to put his soiled clothing in the garment reprocessor.
 TROI / I sense a touch of hostility here, gentlemen.
 WORF / I specifically told you that!
 TROI / If I may suggest...
 WORF / You know very well that the same rules apply today that...
 TROI / Please! (beat; on their silence) Why not simply draw up a contract, which defines the duties of each family member?
 TROI / No, it means you both agree on your responsibilities. And when you've done the things you've agreed to do, then you've earned the privilege of doing things you want to do. (to Worf) When he's cleaned his room, for instance, then maybe he's earned a visit to the holodeck to fight his alien monsters.
 WORF / You suggest bribery?
 TROI / I suggest working out an equitable system where the rules are spelled out as clearly as possible. For the child and the parent. You must list your responsibilities, too. (to Alexander) What would you like your father to promise?
 WORF / (loudly) I do not yell.
 TROI / Then you should have no trouble with that part.
 TROI / Well. Why don't you both go back to your quarters and talk it over? Decide on the points each of you wants in the contract...
 WORF / (beat; grumpy) Very well.
 TROI / One day you'll be glad your father cared enough about you to insist on rules. It may seem hard to imagine right now... but eventually, most children come to appreciate their parents.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Counselor Troi. Your mother's just come aboard.
 TROI / On the other hand...
 TROI / I beg your pardon?
 TROI / Mother, where did you... when did you meet this man? Who is he? I mean... marriage. When did all this happen?
 TROI / Mother, if you're happy, then I'm happy for you. I only asked who this man is, and where you met him. Those are not unusual questions.
 TROI / Who is he?
 TROI / Naturally. I didn't know you'd ever been to Kostolain. Or was he on some diplomatic mission to Betazed... ?
 TROI / Mother. Don't you think you should at least meet the man you're going to marry before committing to spend the rest of your life with him?
 WORF / You have to agree. That's what an agreement is. (to Troi) Excuse the intrusion, Counselor, but we are having some difficulty drawing up our contract. (nods to Lwaxana) Mrs. Troi.
 WORF / The boy is unreasonable.
 TROI / Alexander, this is my mother.
 TROI / It's between father and son. A fair and balanced way of achieving a mutual sense of order.
 TROI / Mother!
 WORF / It is Worf, Madam.
 TROI / Mother, will you kindly stay out of this?
 WORF / He would be... sanctioned, yes.
 TROI / Mother, will you please!
 WORF / I, not perform my duty?!
 PICARD / Married? She's getting married?
 RIKER / If we hold present course, we'll rendezvous with her intended groom in thirty-one hours.
 PICARD / I will not continue to have this ship used by that woman for her convenience, simply because her daughter is one of my officers.
 RIKER / Apparently, Deanna's being aboard was only part of the reason.
 PICARD / The other part being?
 RIKER / She seems to think that the honor of giving away the bride should belong to you.
 PICARD / (halts, musing; resumes walking) Permission for an on-board wedding is granted, Number One. Nothing would please me more than giving Mrs. Troi away.
 WORF / Come.
 WORF (cont'd) / Isn't Alexander supposed to be with you?
 TROI / (now concerned) He didn't show up for his appointment, so I assumed he must still be here.
 WORF / Computer. What is the location of Alexander Rozhenko?
 TROI / Is he there alone?
 TROI / Mother, I'm trying to help this boy learn the value of responsibility. You're not helping by giving him a lot of mixed messages.
 TROI / Among other things, his relationship with his father. No more holodeck, Mother. Please. (Beat) And why aren't you all absorbed in your wedding plans? It's only three days away.
 TROI / (dubious) Mother...
 TROI / Wedding gown? Mother. Stop. Are you telling me you're not going to be naked at your own wedding?
 TROI / I can't believe I'm hearing this from the Heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed; Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx.
 TROI / I think it's time you tell me about this mysterious marriage to a man you've never met.
 DATA / A Level Four diagnostic of the food replication system has failed to detect any faults in the orientation terminals.
 GEORDI / That may be... but we've still got almost two hundred reports of replicators malfunctioning.
 DATA / There is an energy fluctuation in one of the utility access corridors.
 GEORDI / (rising) Well, we'd better look into whatever it is before the captain decides to order dinner.
 GEORDI / Dash four three; here we are.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Some kind of intermittent E-M field pattern. Give me a hand here, will you, Data?
 GEORDI / (continuing) No plasma leakage... just a little negative ion charging.
 DATA / We have traced the failure to a data net interface which routes replicator selections to the correct subprocessors.
 GEORDI / When we opened the panel, we found that the interface had been transformed... into a gelatinous material that we haven't been able to identify.
 WORF / We have intermittent failure of the inertial damping system.
 PICARD / Take us out of warp, Ensign.
 RIKER / Primary attitude control has failed; we've gone to secondary systems.
 DATA / We have lost helm control.
 GEORDI / The same thing that happened to the replicator happened to the stabilizer. The transfers in both systems were turned into... (re: petri dish) ...this.
 RIKER / Some kind of corrosion?
 DATA / We have not yet identified the substance, Commander.
 GEORDI / Whatever it is, it looks like there's been a conversion process -- transforming some of the metal into gelatinous residue. But what caused it is a mystery.
 PICARD / The stabilizers and the replicators. Two totally unrelated systems...
 GEORDI / Yessir, and we still don't know why the sensors didn't catch the problems.
 RIKER / Why don't you run a mass spectrometer analysis -- find out just what this stuff is.
 PICARD / I'll be right there. (to Geordi and Data) The bridegroom.
 PICARD / Please excuse my tardiness; ship's duties. Minister Campio? I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard, sir.
 PICARD / Not at all, sir.
 TROI / (matches his bow) I am, sir.
 PICARD / He is nonetheless welcome.
 PICARD / Of course. The ship is yours.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard to the bridge, please.
 PICARD / (to com) On my way. (to all) Excuse me. (to Troi; not without humor) Counselor, I'll trust you to keep everything running smoothly.
 TROI / Thank you, Captain.
 GEORDI / It looks like the only alloy common to the stabilizer and the replicator is nitrium. (to computer) Computer, analyze the nitrium content of the affected stabilizer and replicator.
 DATA / There is none present in the residue, either.
 GEORDI / According to the mass spectrometer, the elements in the residue have been broken down into simpler molecular structures...
 DATA / That would suggest the nitrium has been organically metabolized.
 GEORDI / Maybe that's it, Data... if a living organism ingested the nitrium...
 DATA / This residue could be the waste left behind.
 GEORDI / If that's true, if something's eating away at the nitrium on the ship... (beat; uncomfortable) That means the dilithium chamber is vulnerable... and the power transfer conduits. We'd better get down to engineering.
 WORF / Eat well, son.
 WORF / What are you doing? What is that noise?
 WORF / That is enough, please. It is your eating hour. Eat.
 WORF / Will you stop doing that, please. Alexander, eat your food. Wisdom will wait, I assure you.
 WORF / No Klingon ever breaks his word.
 WORF / Where are you going?
 WORF / I did not mean now. Now you will sit down and eat.
 WORF / (losing it) Understand later. Now, just eat!
 WORF / I do not understand. I have been very clear with the boy as to his obligations. And yet -- he continues to ignore me.
 TROI / I know what you mean. I've been quite clear with my mother about her not interfering with Alexander... but she does what she wants in spite of it.
 WORF / When I was six years old, I listened to what my parents said. I obeyed their rules.
 WORF / Most of the time.
 TROI / When I was six, she gave me a birthday party. Halfway through it, she disappeared... and finally came back dressed as a Koropian princess... carried in a sedan chair by four young men. It was mortifying.
 WORF / My mother would not have done that.
 TROI / It seems that all my life I've felt like I'm the parent... and my mother is the child...
 TROI / I wonder why I'm at such a loss to put a stop to it?
 WORF / And I wonder why I have lost control of Alexander.
 TROI / You know... it's been said that grandparents and grandchildren get along so well because they have a common enemy.
 TROI / Mother, we need to talk...
 TROI / Mother, we've come for Alexander. (to all) Please forgive the intrusion, but...
 WORF / Mrs. Troi, it is Alexander's dinner hour.
 WORF / Alexander, you will please return to quarters and have your dinner.
 TROI / Mother, you are undermining every effort we're trying to make here.
 TROI / Hah!
 WORF / Definitely not. My son is to return to quarters!
 TROI / Well, sir, I'm afraid even the bride won't be present for this one.
 DATA / The dilithium chamber shows no anomalous readings.
 GEORDI / So far, these transfer conduits are clean, too -- hold on, I'm getting something here...
 GEORDI / There's a pretty severe energy fluctuation in this access panel...
 GEORDI / When we saw that photonic trail moving through the walls, we realized we must be dealing with a metal parasite of some kind.
 DATA / We believe the parasites came through the ship's hull when we destroyed the asteroid near Tessen Three.
 PICARD / Are they attacking anything other than nitrium alloy?
 GEORDI / Not that we can tell. But we've got nitrium everywhere -- ventilation, life support, engines, computers... even in the dilithium chamber.
 PICARD / Mister Data... you said the asteroid we destroyed was rich in nitrium...
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / That asteroid was from the Pelloris Field... if the rest of that field is rich in nitrium... it would have been a natural feeding ground.
 GEORDI / We should think about going back there... it's possible the parasites could be lured back to the asteroids... for a meal that's more appealing than we are.
 PICARD / How long to the field, Mister Data?
 DATA / At warp nine, five hours twenty minutes, sir.
 PICARD / (keys combadge) Picard to the bridge...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker here, sir.
 PICARD / Set a course for the Pelloris asteroid field -- warp nine.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Captain, with our sensors unable to detect the parasites... and given the speed with which they appear to be moving through the ship --
 PICARD / -- then we may not have five hours and twenty minutes. I'm aware of that. What can we do to slow them down?
 DATA / In several cases, an exanogen gas barrier has been known to slow the progress of metal parasites.
 PICARD / They don't like the cold, eh? Make it so.
 GEORDI / The problem is finding them. By the time we spot an energy fluctuation, they've consumed all the nitrium and moved on.
 GEORDI / Primary power systems are going down. I'll reroute to the secondary generators.
 PICARD / Advise the bridge. (turns to exit) Mister Data, with me.
 PICARD / Bridge.
 PICARD / Commander, do you have any suggestions on how we could encourage the parasites to leave the ship once we reach the Pelloris Field?
 DATA / If we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration of nitrium, and project it toward one of the asteroids...
 PICARD / They'll follow the beam... like a trail of breadcrumbs. Very well --
 DATA / Turbolift velocity is beginning to fluctuate, Captain.
 PICARD / Computer; stop at next level. (no response) Computer, acknowledge.
 DATA / We have reached the bridge, sir.
 PICARD / Report, Number One.
 RIKER / Life support and ventilation are failing at random spots all over the ship.
 WORF / Captain, we've dropped to warp five-point-seven.
 PICARD / Picard to engineering.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here...
 PICARD / What's happening, Mister La Forge? We're slowing down.
 GEORDI / The parasites must've gotten into the primary warp controller, sir.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm trying to do a bypass patch to isolate the backup controllers... but it looks like warp six is the best I can give you.
 PICARD / At that speed there won't be a ship left to reach the Pelloris Field. Do what you have to.
 GEORDI / Working on it, sir.
 DATA / Captain, we're losing life support on decks eleven and twelve.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, have security evacuate all personnel from those decks.
 GEORDI / (keys combadge) Engineering to bridge. We've got warp six-point-five... but I don't know how much more coaxing I can do here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We need more speed than that, Commander.
 GEORDI / The matter-antimatter injectors are failing... I'm rerouting to secondary injector power now. (to crewpersons) Watch the antimatter containment for any system failure!
 RIKER / Atmospheric systems are down to twenty-seven percent. We're going below tolerable oxygen limits.
 WORF / We must evacuate decks twenty through twenty-four, Captain.
 PICARD / Make it so... and shut down all life support to those decks.
 RIKER / (to com) Direct all evacuees to decks nine and ten.
 PICARD / (to Data) Divert emergency life support to those decks.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / Time to the asteroid field?
 DATA / If we maintain current speed -- and there is no guarantee that we will -- two hours, twenty-three minutes.
 PICARD / Mister Data. The rest of us may lose consciousness. If we do, it will be your job to execute the plan as discussed.
 DATA / Aye, Captain.
 DATA / Computer, transfer power from warp engines to life support.
 DATA / Activate Bussard collector.
 DATA / Reconfigure hydrogen-plasma mixture to include thirty percent nitrium.
 DATA / Project emitter beam, heading zero-two-four, mark zero-four-one.
 PICARD / Mister Data... ?
 DATA / The plan was successful, sir.
 PICARD / Well done...
 PICARD / Mister Worf... coordinate your teams with Doctor Crusher and Commander La Forge... assess damage and injury.
 WORF / Aye, Captain.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45733.6. Temporary repairs to the ship have been completed. (beat; wry) Our attention now turns to matters of a more festive nature.
 RIKER / (thru closed lips) You'd think she'd at least get to her own wedding on time.
 TROI / We still have to learn how to live in the real world. All of us, Mother.
 WORF / (lost) You're just supposed to sit here?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45761.3. In an effort to bring an end to their centuries-long war, Krios and Valt Minor have agreed to a Ceremony of Reconciliation, to be held aboard the Enterprise at a point mid-way between their two systems.
 PICARD and the Kriosian Ambassador, BRIAM. Briam is / tall, almost frail-looking, and his people have dark skin and hair, much in the manner of those from Earth's Indian subcontinent. Picard hands him a cup of tea.
 PICARD / I apologize for the delay in our arrival; we had to stop at Harod Four and pick up a group of stranded miners.
 PICARD / Was Mister La Forge able to provide the special cargo handling provisions you requested?
 PICARD / I trust, Ambassador, that this cargo is not in any way dangerous?
 RIKER's COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 RIKER / (continuing) We've picked up a distress call from a Ferengi shuttle...
 PICARD / (rises) Set a course to intercept...
 RIKER / Aye, sir...
 PICARD / We'll be at the rendezvous on schedule, don't worry.
 DATA / The Ferengi report their containment field is collapsing...
 WORF / We are within visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / Their reactor core is unstable, Captain...
 PICARD / How many on board?
 DATA / Two, sir.
 RIKER / (to com) Bridge to transporter room three. Boost your output and lock on to the two Ferengi on board the shuttle. We may have to attempt a long-range transport.
 PICARD / Energize!
 RIKER / Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi guests to quarters... (afterthought) ... not too close to mine.
 WORF / Understood.
 WORF / Unless you can arrange for your own transport, you will have to remain on the Enterprise until we have completed our mission...
 WORF / The captain dines alone.
 GEORDI / We've been working from your drawings, Ambassador... I hope we're in the ballpark...
 PICARD / An old Human expression... Mister LaForge hopes we've come close to achieving what you wanted...
 GEORDI / Computer, run holodeck program Krios One.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge is entirely at your disposal, Ambassador...
 GEORDI / Just let me know what you need...
 PICARD / The ambassador is very busy...
 PICARD / I am the captain of this ship.
 PICARD / (continuing) What is it you want?
 PICARD / May I suggest that you arrange to meet at another time, after the ceremony?
 GEORDI / (takes his arm) Listen... have you been down to see the dolphins yet? You really shouldn't miss them...
 PICARD / (to com) Deck seven.
 PICARD / Picard to Worf.
 WORF (V.O.) / Worf, here.
 PICARD / One of the Ferengi just waylaid Ambassador Briam. Keep a short leash on them, Lieutenant.
 WORF at tactical. / 
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) I don't want them disrupting this conference.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WORF / Security to cargo bay one.
 RIKER / Lieutenant?
 WORF / One of the Ferengi.
 WORF / You! What are you doing?
 RIKER / (to Worf, re: the Ferengi) Get him out of here. Confine both of them to their quarters and put a guard on the door.
 PICARD / What is happening?
 PICARD / I'm afraid I require an explanation...
 RIKER / (to Briam) You've been using this ship to transport a sentient being as property?
 PICARD / Your concern was justified, Ambassador...
 PICARD / There is a provision within the Federation Constitution that protects an individual's fundamental rights... once you were brought aboard this starship...
 RIKER / Why?
 PICARD / A "metamorph"?
 RIKER / (reacts) You mean... you change according to whatever man you're with...
 RIKER / (to Picard) Which explains our Ferengi's interest...
 PICARD / You do this of your own accord?
 PICARD / Commander Riker will show you to quarters. You need not travel in a cargo bay.
 RIKER / Why were you in stasis?
 RIKER / In what way?
 RIKER / (resisting) Ah, unfortunately, I'm not an empath...
 RIKER / I think you have me at a disadvantage...
 RIKER / The replicator is here... companel here... the sonic shower is through there... you can adjust the lights by verbal commands... and if you have any questions, just ask the...
 RIKER / (beat) ...the... computer...
 RIKER / I'm beginning to sense those elevated pheromones you were talking about...
 RIKER / Curious isn't exactly the way I'd describe it.
 RIKER / You mean, there's something even more remarkable about you?
 RIKER / Listen... this has been... educational... but I've made it a policy never to open another man's gift...
 RIKER / (ironic) It certainly is. (beat, "get me out of here") We'll try to make you as comfortable as possible.
 RIKER / Riker to bridge. If you need me, I'll be in holodeck four.
 BEVERLY / How can you simply deliver her like a courier into a life of virtual prostitution...
 PICARD / Beverly, arranged marriages have been the basis of political alliances in many cultures, including our own...
 BEVERLY / I'm surprised at you.
 PICARD / She knows exactly what she's doing.
 BEVERLY / She has been conditioned since the day she was born to believe that it is perfectly acceptable to exist only to please men...
 PICARD / Beverly, she was born this way...
 BEVERLY / ... and bred by those people to seal a treaty with a seductive coup de grace...
 PICARD / (angry now, with frustration and sarcasm) By all means, we should throw the Prime Directive to the wind... detain her against her will... destroy any chance these worlds have for peace... interefere with their society, with their customs...
 BEVERLY / (interrupting) That slave trader who calls himself an ambassador has confined her to her quarters... she's a virtual prisoner in there...
 PICARD / I didn't know that...
 BEVERLY / It's your ship. Maybe there are a few things you should find out about.
 PICARD / I'll speak with her.
 BEVERLY / Good. ... Lovely breakfast.
 PICARD / Indeed.
 PICARD / Are you comfortable?
 PICARD / It has come to my attention that you have been told to remain here...
 PICARD / Against your wishes.
 PICARD / My crew's performance is not the business of the ambassador.
 PICARD / I care about what happens on board my ship.
 PICARD / (ready to change the subject) Yes...
 PICARD / Don't.
 PICARD / Do this. (off her look) What you do... with men.
 PICARD / Frankly, it is difficult for me... for many of us... to easily accept that a sentient being could live only to be what someone else wants them to be...
 PICARD / What about your wishes? Your needs?
 PICARD / And what about when there are no others, when you are alone... ?
 PICARD / (a beat) I'm sorry. Under the circumstances, I felt it would help to learn more about you.
 PICARD / I will speak with the ambassador about easing your restrictions.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45780.3. We have reached the designated coordinates for the conference and await the arrival of Chancellor Alrik.
 PICARD / (displeased) "Forbid" it... ?
 PICARD / (controlled) You cannot confine her against her will, Ambassador... not on board this ship...
 PICARD / (continuing) She is requesting some freedom of movement... and I intend to give it to her...
 PICARD / Not every man...
 DATA / I would be pleased to escort you around the ship.
 DATA / I am an artificial lifeform.
 DATA / Your empathic powers do not perceive anything because I have no emotions.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, I'm quite busy with the arrangements for the conference.
 PICARD / I think you should enjoy the hospitality of our ship. Mister Data will see to your every comfort... if you will excuse me...
 DATA / Your empathic powers do not perceive anything because as an android, I have no emotions...
 RIKER / (to Worf) I'll... check in with you later.
 DATA / Extremely rude behavior.
 DATA / May I order you a drink?
 DATA / There do not seem to be enough waiters on duty.
 DATA / Certainly...
 DATA / No, I think I shall remain here...
 WORF / Is there a problem here?
 WORF / Be quiet!
 DATA / Thank you, Lieutenant Worf, I believe the crowd has become a little too ebullient for comfort... (to Kamala) ... perhaps you'd enjoy a quiet visit to the arboretum...
 WORF / (to the miners) Stay here.
 DATA / Thank you again, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Ma'am.
 PICARD / I am confident of my crew's self-control. But there are civilians and guests on board...
 PICARD / What?
 PICARD / You are a day away from an arranged mating. Why would you want me to visit you in your quarters?
 PICARD / Yes...
 PICARD / (reacts) Woven art? Recovered intact?
 PICARD / (enthusiastic) I've read about them for years... They were so delicate, no one expected to find any preserved... How did you hear about them?
 PICARD / Your empathic powers can tell that much about me?
 PICARD / Nothing. Nothing lies beneath. I'm really quite dull. I fall asleep each night with an old book in my hands...
 PICARD / I don't take it lightly... I'm only... (struggling) ... trying to be as dull as possible.
 PICARD / It would be inappropriate.
 PICARD / I'm sorry.
 PICARD / Why are you doing this?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. The Ferengi have been dispatched via shuttle to Starbase One-one-seven; what charges will be brought against them depends on whether or not Ambassador Briam recovers.
 BEVERLY / We've been able to stabilize his condition... If we're lucky he'll regain consciousness in a few days.
 BEVERLY / (continuing, to the nurse) I want a level one craniosacral display set up...
 PICARD / I'll advise the Valtese delegation that the conference must be postponed...
 PICARD / But there are several points in the negotiations that Briam has to address...
 PICARD / Familiar, yes, but I cannot represent your peoples' interests...
 PICARD / There are customs and rituals with which I have no experience at all...
 PICARD / This is impossible.
 PICARD / I am reminded of my piano lessons as a child... preparing for some dreaded recital...
 PICARD / No. I regret that I gave it up. It used to please my mother...
 PICARD / (continuing) I did not like to perform in front of an audience.
 PICARD / No. Just not very good.
 PICARD / Dammit.
 PICARD / Can we come back to this later?
 PICARD / You are going to have to help me with the pronuniciations in this scroll...
 PICARD / Kamala...
 PICARD / I find you unavailable.
 PICARD / Really, what instrument?
 PICARD / The entire orchestra?
 PICARD / It sounds like it was a very lonely time for you...
 PICARD / I also once asked you if you were doing this of your own accord...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / The Valtese ship has arrived. Chancellor Alrik is ready to beam aboard...
 PICARD / Chancellor Alrik, welcome aboard the Enterprise...
 PICARD / He hasn't regained consciousness yet.
 PICARD / I will do my best... although I have found some of the rituals quite demanding...
 PICARD / The Kriosians have authorized me to make several compromises which are favorable to your position...
 PICARD / Briam has supervised a reproduction of the ancient Temple of Akadar on our holodeck...
 PICARD / Kamala? Yes. She is looking forward to meeting you.
 PICARD / First impressions? A thoughtful man... informed...
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / That you were looking forward to meeting him.
 PICARD / It will be the first order of business. Tomorrow. At ten.
 PICARD / I should prepare for the ceremony.
 PICARD / I think I can muddle my way through...
 PICARD / The lights stay on.
 PICARD / (re: the tea) Did you learn that from Mister Data as well?
 PICARD / I shall have to have a talk with him.
 PICARD / Now that I know you're listening to my voice... I can't seem to think of a word to say...
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / (softly) Kamala, have I not done everything possible to discourage this?
 PICARD / I don't wish to use you as other men have.
 PICARD / I really ought to go. You do have an early appointment in the morning.
 BEVERLY / Quiet this morning.
 PICARD / Sorry.
 BEVERLY / Penny?
 PICARD / What?
 BEVERLY / For your thoughts. Penny for your thoughts.
 PICARD / (smiles) You have one?
 BEVERLY / The replicator ought to have one on file.
 PICARD / Do you mind if I take off the uniform for a moment?
 BEVERLY / (smiles) Captain... !
 PICARD / I just need to talk to a friend.
 BEVERLY / Of course.
 PICARD / (tongue in cheek) Besides... it's all your fault.
 BEVERLY / Mine?
 PICARD / You insisted I look into her situation...
 BEVERLY / The metamorph?
 PICARD / (sighs) The metamorph. Kamala. We have spent a lot of time together the last few days... you were right about several things, Beverly... her entire life has been orchestrated for this moment... but she intends to see it through... to help her people end this war...
 BEVERLY / (beat, perplexed by his intensity) Are you saying there's nothing else that can be done... ?
 PICARD / It's not that simple.
 PICARD / I barely even know who she is because who she is changes the moment the next man walks in the room. (beat, softens) But suddenly, I find myself hoping... the next man doesn't walk in.
 PICARD / But he will, of course. In a few hours, the ceremony will begin... she will mate with a man who cares far more about trade agreements than about her. And I think of how she will be with him... how she will change to accomodate him... and... (beat, understatement) ... I don't like it.
 PICARD / I'm sorry to be bothering you with this...
 BEVERLY / I wish I knew how to help you...
 PICARD / (with warm appreciation) Perhaps I just needed a shoulder...
 BEVERLY / It's there for you, Jean-Luc. It always has been.
 PICARD / Soon.
 PICARD / Many.
 PICARD / You've not even met him.
 PICARD / Kamala...
 PICARD / With me?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Not now, Data.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / But sir, Chancellor Alrik is waiting to receive you in holodeck seven.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (a beat) You can't go through with the ceremony.
 PICARD / I'm sorry. I cannot allow this to proceed.
 PICARD / Kamala will be remaining aboard the Enterprise... with me...
 PICARD / Chancellor, the trade agreements will be satisfactory... you yourself told me that was your priority. She is mine. Let us begin the real work here of establishing a long and just peace...
 PICARD / Your preparation made the negotiations simple, Ambassador... and Kamala was able to guide me through the rituals...
 PICARD / Curious?
 PICARD / (evenly) Ambassador, have a safe trip home.
 PICARD / Earl Grey. Hot.
 TROI / Purple omelettes?
 TROI / I can see her point...
 TROI / Sugar with your tea?
 TROI / Isabella... would you like some too?
 TROI / I'll bet Isabella is very pretty.
 TROI / Maybe you could draw me a picture. I'd love to see what she looks like.
 TROI / I think she's real for you, Clara. And that's real enough for me.
 TROI / Is that so?
 TROI / I hope to see you soon, Clara. Maybe we can be friends.
 TROI / Yes?
 TROI / Thank you, Isabella.
 TROI / I understand why you're concerned... but you have nothing to worry about. It's a normal, healthy activity for children to engage in imaginary play.
 TROI / You've been moving from starship to starship since Clara was two years old. Maybe Isabella provides a constant companion for Clara. She knows this is one friend she won't have to leave behind.
 TROI / Give Clara a chance. As she learns to make friends on the Enterprise, she'll probably move away from her imaginary world.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45852.1. The Enterprise has arrived at FGC-four-seven -- a nebula which has formed around a neutron star. We are eager to investigate this unique formation.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, ENSIGN FELTON and VARIOUS / NDS at stations. GEORDI is at an aft science station. Everyone watches the main viewscreen, which displays the nebula -- a rare and special sight.
 GEORDI / (off console) We've got elevated quantities of hydrogen... helium... trionium... but nothing the shields can't handle.
 RIKER / Shields up.
 PICARD / Take us in, Ensign. One-quarter impulse.
 DATA / In order to complete the scheduled observations, the lateral sensors will require additional processing time.
 GEORDI / We could steal a couple of hours while they're recalibrating the thermal interferometery scanner.
 DATA / Will a couple of hours be enough time to complete the high-resolution series on the neutron star?
 GEORDI / No problem. We'll just double up the main sensor bandwidth.
 BEVERLY and NURSE OGAWA are working at a medical / station, mid-conversation. During this scene, out of their view, a small section of the wall GLOWS with a red color, and the point of LIGHT emerges into the room. The light flits about, as if watching Beverly and Ogawa from afar...
 BEVERLY / After dinner, then what?
 BEVERLY / The neural scanner still seems a bit off. Let's check the sensor calibration...
 BEVERLY / And... ?
 BEVERLY / After Paris... ?
 BEVERLY / No problem. Nurse Davila can cover for you.
 BEVERLY (o.s.) / Try to talk him into Telana Minor instead -- they've got a cruise down the Jokri River... the iridescent currents are beautiful.
 GEORDI / So what are we going to name this nebula? "FGC-four-seven" just doesn't have a nice ring to it.
 DATA / The rotational period of the neutron star is one point three five seconds.
 GEORDI / That's a bit on the long side. Sutter -- let's see if we can get a reading on the particle flux.
 GEORDI / I was thinking more along the lines of "The La Forge Nebula." Sounds sort of majestic, don't you think?
 DATA / Based on those selections, I would prefer FGC-four-seven.
 GEORDI / It felt like we hit something.
 DATA / Shields have registered an impact. But the sensors show nothing in the vicinity.
 WORF / (off console) Forward velocity is down by point two percent. And dropping...
 PICARD / Engineering. Report.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Could be a problem with the shields, Captain. We're checking it out now.
 GEORDI / So -- did we hit something or not?
 GEORDI / Shields say yes, sensors say no... this is very strange...
 GEORDI / (to Sutter, on the move) Ensign, give me a breakdown on shield energy conversion. Run a spectral --
 GEORDI / (to Clara) Whoa. Where did you come from?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Bridge to La Forge. Our speed is still dropping.
 GEORDI / I'm increasing power to the impulse engines... but forward velocity isn't consistent with engine output.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Explanation.
 GEORDI / It looks like something is increasing the drag coefficient on the ship. But we can't find the cause...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / If you can't correct it... we're going to have to reverse course and leave the nebula.
 GEORDI / Give me a couple of minutes, sir...
 DATA / The drag coefficient continues to increase. Forward velocity has fallen by twelve percent.
 DATA / Our speed is increasing...
 DATA / The ship's speed has stabilized at one-quarter impulse.
 GEORDI / Great, Data. What'd you do?
 DATA / I did nothing, Commander. (checks console) The problem seems to have corrected itself.
 GEORDI / I don't have an explanation, sir. We seemed to hit something... and then we started losing speed. But so far as we can tell, there's nothing out there to hit.
 RIKER / Could some kind of damping field cause us to lose velocity?
 DATA / We simulated several such fields, but were unable to reproduce the same drag coefficient.
 GEORDI / We also don't know why the problem suddenly corrected itself.
 PICARD / It seems we're observing a unique phenomenon... one that hasn't been recorded before.
 GEORDI / The question is, do we stay here and check it out?
 RIKER / That may be dangerous.
 DATA / Since we have experienced the phenomenon only once, it is impossible to estimate the risks.
 GEORDI / I'd like to stick around a little longer, sir... collect a sample of the gaseous matter, see what it tells us...
 PICARD / Agreed. Collect your sample, Mister La Forge. We'll proceed -- with caution. (beat) Dismissed.
 WORF / This area is not designated for children.
 WORF / Are you lost?
 WORF / Where are you supposed to be?
 WORF / Return to your quarters. And we will forget this incident.
 GEORDI / Okay... I've configured the magnetic coils to collect gaseous matter from the nebula. Go ahead and activate the beam emitter.
 GEORDI / We'll take samples from eight random sections. That should give us a reliable measure.
 GEORDI / Two of them, as a matter of fact. My father was an exozoologist... my mother a command officer.
 GEORDI / That's putting it mildly. They were always on the move... some of the time together, some times separately... I never knew if I was going to be stationed with my dad while he studied invertebrates in the Modean system... or with my mom on some outpost near the Neutral Zone.
 GEORDI / I don't remember it that way...
 GEORDI / I guess there were things about my childhood that weren't ideal... but to me, it was like one long adventure. (beat) Kids are tougher than you think. As long as they know you love them... they can handle just about anything life throws at them.
 DATA / I believe what you are seeing is the effect of the fluid dynamic processes inherent to large scale motion of highly rarified gas.
 DATA / Where?
 DATA / I do not see it. (analytical) It is interesting that people try to find meaningful patterns in things that are essentially random. I have noticed that the images they perceive can sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that particular moment.
 DATA / (re: nebula) Besides, it is clear that this cloud formation most closely resembles a "bunny rabbit."
 TROI / Hello, Clara.
 TROI / Clara... would you and Isabella like to take a walk with me?
 TROI / Clara, you haven't been on this ship very long, so maybe you don't know that Ten Forward is usually for grown-ups.
 TROI / If Isabella is telling you to do things you know are wrong... then you must tell her it's not acceptable.
 TROI / (to lift) Deck thirty-two.
 TROI / (to Clara) Would you like me to talk to Isabella for you?
 TROI / Isabella... it's not very nice to tell Clara to do things she isn't supposed to.
 TROI / From now on... I want you to ask a grown-up before you go places that are off-limits.
 TROI / What did she say?
 TROI / Clara. Please tell me what Isabella said.
 TROI / I'm a little concerned about the turn this is taking. It seems Clara is starting to do inappropriate things... and she's blaming them on Isabella.
 TROI / I don't think it's too serious yet. But we should make more of an effort to get her involved with real friends her own age. (beat) The Children's Center is having a ceramics class this afternoon. Why don't I take Clara?
 TROI / I'll see if there's room left in the class. In the meantime, make yourself available to Clara. Let her know she doesn't have to rely on Isabella when she needs someone to talk to.
 TROI (o.s.) / Counselor Troi.
 TROI / Hello, Clara.
 TROI / I came to ask if you'd like to come to a ceramics class.
 TROI / No, Clara. We'll do something with Isabella another day.
 DATA / Sir, as we move deeper into the nebula, sensors indicate that levels of helium and trionium have continued to rise steadily
 PICARD / Is it anything the shields can't handle?
 DATA / No, sir, we are well within tolerance levels --
 PICARD / Mister Data -- ?
 DATA / Shields have registered an impact, sir...
 PICARD / But sensors don't show anything out there, right?
 DATA / No, sir. There is no indication of anything near the ship.
 WORF / Forward velocity is dropping, Captain. Down by point-four percent.
 PICARD / Can we go to warp speed?
 DATA / Until we determine the cause of the drag coefficient, I would not recommend it, sir.
 WORF / Forward velocity is down by one point one percent.
 PICARD / Ensign, increase power to the impulse engines.
 DATA / Impulse engines are now at full power.
 WORF / We are no longer losing speed.
 DATA / Forward velocity is holding steady. The drag coefficient is still present, but it has stabilized.
 PICARD / (to Com) Bridge to Commander Riker... check with Mister La Forge... see if he's found anything in that matter sample from the nebula.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / On my way, sir.
 RIKER / Any luck?
 GEORDI / Yeah -- take a look at this...
 GEORDI / We tried radiating the matter sample with just about everything we could think of. We didn't find anything... until we subjected it to a high frequency warp field...
 GEORDI / (re: strand) This may be what we've been running into...
 RIKER / Do you know what it is?
 GEORDI / We think so. Now that the sensors can read it, it seems to be a highly cohesive form of plasma -- like a strand of energy.
 GEORDI / When these things come in contact with our shields, it produces a resonant effect -- and creates the drag coefficient we've been experiencing.
 RIKER / Anything like this on record?
 GEORDI / No.
 RIKER / Any idea how many more of these there might be?
 GEORDI / No. But if we run the warp field generators through the deflector grid, we could radiate a field outside the ship.
 RIKER / ... and we'd see for ourselves. Let's do it.
 GEORDI / Aye.
 TROI / Alexander, I thought you might like a partner.
 TROI / This is Clara Sutter. She's new on board. Clara, meet Alexander Rozhenko.
 TROI / It's alright...
 TROI / Clara, would you like some clay of your own?
 WORF / Warp field generators are standing by.
 GEORDI / Captain -- we should be able to illuminate any strands within two thousand kilometers of the ship.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 GEORDI / Initiating field generation...
 PICARD / Remarkable...
 DATA / (works console) It is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty-seven million strands of energy.
 GEORDI / Captain -- with this many out there, the resonant effect on our shields could cause a problem...
 PICARD / Agreed. Ensign -- bring us about and take us out of the nebula.
 DATA / That may be difficult, sir. I am now detecting a significant number of strands behind us.
 PICARD / Do your best, Ensign.
 TROI / (to replicator) Hot chocolate.
 TROI / (to computer) Computer -- list my appointment schedule for next week.
 PICARD / Status, Mister Data?
 DATA / At our current speed, we will clear the nebula in twelve minutes, four seconds.
 PICARD / Continue full sensor sweeps. I want all the information we can gather.
 WORF / (off console) Captain -- forward velocity down point six percent.
 WORF / Velocity down two point four percent.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / We are moving through a dense concentration of energy strands.
 RIKER / Can we go to warp?
 GEORDI / The stress on the hull would be too great...
 DATA / (off console) Captain -- density appears to be lower off the starboard bow.
 PICARD / Ensign, bring us to bearing oh-three-oh mark five.
 WORF / Forward velocity holding...
 PICARD / Steady as she goes...
 TROI / Pardon me?
 TROI / I'm sure the cake is fine. I've just been thinking...
 TROI / I'm just... wondering... if I'm doing the right thing.
 TROI / I know the best thing to do is to gradually wean her away from her fantasy... And today she did meet some new friends, and had a good time with them.
 TROI / But... at the same time, I can't help wondering if I'm stealing something from her... something precious...
 TROI / ... a part of her childhood that she'll never have again.
 TROI / Your imaginary friend?
 TROI / (surprised) You still talk to it?
 TROI / Go ahead, Ensign.
 TROI / On my way.
 TROI / Clara... your father tells me Isabella has been saying some very bad things to you.
 TROI / What did she say?
 TROI / Who's going to come and kill everyone?
 TROI / Did she say why?
 TROI / I know you must be very frightened. Sometimes what we imagine can be just as scary as something real. (beat) But I promise you -- there's no way Isabella can harm you or anyone on this ship.
 TROI / You can see her... ?
 TROI / If I go with you and hold your hand, will you go into your room?
 TROI / We'll make sure Isabella isn't anywhere around. Alright?
 TROI / Come on.
 TROI / Do you see anybody?
 TROI / Let's look under the bed...
 TROI / Is she there?
 TROI / Now... where else?
 TROI / Is she behind here?
 TROI / Maybe Isabella's gone home...
 TROI / Anything there?
 TROI / Maybe Isabella knows you're making new friends now. (MORE)
 TROI (cont'd) / In fact, I'll bet she won't be coming around as much anymore...
 TROI / Oh. Okay...
 TROI / Anybody in here?
 TROI / She was eleven, maybe twelve... with blonde hair...
 TROI / Clara...
 BEVERLY / Clara's sleeping. She's going to be fine.
 BEVERLY / (re: Troi) Her bioelectrical processes were severely disrupted. It's like the energy was pulled right out of her body.
 PICARD / (taps communicator) Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf here.
 PICARD / We have established the presence of what appears to be an alien entity on board. (beat) It seems the entity has manifested itself in the form of a twelve- year-old girl who has been seen with Clara Sutter. She has blonde hair... blue eyes...
 WORF / (cutting in) ... and a blue dress? Yes sir, I have seen her.
 PICARD / When?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Two days ago, near engineering. She was with Miss Sutter.
 PICARD / (reacts) Engineering... Security Alert, Mister Worf. Be on the lookout.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Thank you, Clara. If we need your help again, I hope we can count on you.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain Picard -- report to the the bridge.
 PICARD / On my way.
 PICARD / Report.
 RIKER / Our speed is down by twenty-two percent.
 GEORDI / Strand density is ten times what it was, Captain. We can't take many more hits...
 PICARD / All stop.
 WORF / Sir -- something is heading toward us, bearing one-oh-three mark oh-two-four.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / What is it?
 DATA / (off console) It appears to be an energy vortex... of highly complex patterns. Very possibly a life form.
 RIKER / Red Alert!
 DATA / It is in direct physical contact with the shields.
 WORF / Shields dropping to seventy-five percent... seventy-two percent...
 RIKER / (realizing) The damn thing's feeding off our shields. Data -- remodulate the shield frequencies!
 DATA / Aye, sir. (beat) No effect.
 WORF / Shields to sixty-four percent.
 GEORDI / (off console) We have about eight minutes before those things drain our shields.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Any ideas?
 PICARD / We know you've been on the ship for some time now. We know you've been posing as Clara's friend -- and that you've been threatening her... (beat) We can only assume there's a connection between you and the life-forms attacking our ship...
 PICARD / You are obviously an intelligent being. There's no reason for you to hide...
 PICARD / Talk to us. Or can you only communicate by frightening a small child?
 PICARD / (to Isabella) Who are you?
 PICARD / Energy... is that why they're draining our shields?
 PICARD / (taps communicator) Picard to bridge. Report.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Shields are down to three percent. We're diverting all available power.
 PICARD / Acknowledged.
 PICARD / If it's energy you want, we can provide it in other ways. You needn't destroy us.
 PICARD / (reacts) What makes you say that?
 PICARD / (surprised) In what way did we mistreat her?
 PICARD / (interrupting) You mean where you wanted her to.
 PICARD / You were taking her to places that were inappropriate -- even dangerous.
 PICARD / We had no way of knowing that. We had no way of knowing you were real. All we knew was that a little girl's imaginary friend was scaring her... threatening her...
 PICARD / I'm beginning to understand. You've seen this ship... all of us... from a unique perspective -- a child's point of view. It must have seemed terribly unfair and restrictive...
 PICARD / As adults, we don't always stop to realize how everything we say and do shapes the impressions of young people. (beat) But if you are to judge us as a people by the way we treat our children... and I cannot think of a better criterion... you must understand how deeply we care for them. When our children are young, they cannot always understand what might be dangerous. Our rules are a way to keep them from harm. Either real or imagined.
 PICARD / This is part of the continuity of the Human species. You see... when Clara grows up, she will make rules for her children... to protect them... just as we protect her.
 PICARD / Status, Number One?
 RIKER / We're free of the strands. We'll have full warp capability in twenty minutes.
 PICARD / Notify all sections we'll be leaving the area in one hour.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, I want you to drive the warp engines to full power, and direct a flow of energy out into the nebula.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45854.2. The Enterprise is charting six star systems that make up the Argolis cluster, an area being considered for colonization.
 PICARD, RIKER, and TROI are in the command area, DATA / at ops, WORF at tactical; various SUPERNUMERARIES fill the other posts as needed.
 RIKER / Very impressive...
 TROI / It's beautiful... and frightening at the same time.
 DATA / (reading console) Radiation bursts from the star's surface are making precise sensor readings difficult. It seems to be exhibiting gravitational instability.
 DATA / The star's fluctuations are too severe. It would be impossible to settle any of the planets in this system.
 DATA / I suggest we proceed to the next system. Its sun is a stable main sequence star.
 PICARD / In a moment, Mister Data.
 DATA / Sir, I am detecting a transmission... emanating from within this system
 RIKER / What kind of signal?
 DATA / It is self-repeating... of unknown pattern.
 PICARD / Where is it coming from?
 DATA / A small moon orbiting the fourth planet.
 PICARD / Life signs?
 DATA / Indeterminate. I am attempting to screen out sensor interference... (he manipulates a few controls) Readings are still inconclusive; however, the moon's atmosphere is capable of supporting life.
 RIKER / Then it could be a distress call.
 RIKER / Helm, take us into transport range. (to com) Doctor Crusher, we need a medical away team in transporter room two.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 BEVERLY / I'm reading one life form... very weak signs.
 RIKER / Riker to Enterprise.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER / We've found the wreckage of a small craft... and one survivor.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / It's a Borg.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (continuing) Male, adolescent -- he's badly hurt.
 DATA / There is no indication of other Borg activity within sensor range.
 PICARD / Away team, prepare to return to the ship.
 BEVERLY / We can't leave him here, he won't survive.
 RIKER / I think the captain understands that.
 BEVERLY / Then I don't.
 RIKER / The Borg usually collect their dead --
 BEVERLY / He's not dead --
 RIKER / And that transmission --
 BEVERLY / -- at least not yet --
 RIKER / That transmission we intercepted was probably a homing signal. We have to assume they're on their way.
 BEVERLY / (acknowledging this) At least let me stabilize his condition, give him a chance of surviving until they get here.
 RIKER / Captain?
 PICARD / Your concern is noted, Doctor. But any intervention on your part would only alert the Borg to our having been here.
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid we've already turned that corner.
 WORF / Kill it. Now. We could make it appear that it died in the crash -- leave no evidence that we were here.
 PICARD / Security measures must be taken before we beam it on board.
 BEVERLY / Standing by...
 PICARD / Mister Data, notify security to prepare a detention cell. (to com) Bridge to engineering.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here.
 PICARD / We're bringing a Borg survivor on board. We'll need to neutralize the homing signal --
 GEORDI at a science station. / 
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (continued) -- prevent it from sending or receiving transmissions of any kind.
 GEORDI / I'll set up a subspace damping field around the detention cell.
 WORF / There are four others. None survived.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Riker.
 RIKER / Go ahead, Enterprise.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / We're transporting you directly to the detention cell.
 BEVERLY / I need him in sickbay --
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / The cell, Doctor. Whatever equipment you need will be brought to you there.
 BEVERLY / Very well.
 PICARD / Come.
 TROI / Captain... I just wondered if there's anything you wanted to talk about.
 PICARD / I don't think so, Counselor.
 TROI / I would have thought that having a Borg on the ship would stir some feelings...
 PICARD / I am quite recovered from my experience, thank you.
 TROI / Sometimes... even when a victim has dealt with his assault... there are residual effects of the event that linger. You were treated violently by the Borg... kidnapped, assaulted, mutilated --
 PICARD / Counselor --
 PICARD / Counselor, I very much appreciate your concern for me. But I assure you, it is misplaced.
 PICARD / I have carefully considered the implications of having this Borg on the ship. I have weighed the possible risks, and I am convinced we've done the right thing. (beat) I am quite comfortable with my decision.
 TROI / I see. Well, if at any point you want to talk more...
 PICARD / I will certainly avail myself of your help.
 WORF / (to Security Guard) Lower the force field.
 WORF / Captain, the Borg is still unconscious.
 BEVERLY / He suffered massive internal injuries. We've got the hemorrhaging under control, but some of the implants in his brain were damaged. I may have to remove them.
 PICARD / The Borg will die if they're removed permanently. Their brains grow dependent on the biochips.
 BEVERLY / Perhaps Geordi could construct new implants...
 GEORDI / They contain relatively straightforward programming, interface protocols... we have the files we downloaded after your experience, sir. I think I could manage it.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge... do you have enought knowledge of Borg programming to alter the pathways to the root command structure?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure, sir. The subroutines are pretty complicated... I'd probably have to study their data processing algorithms... that's the only way I could trace the access codes.
 PICARD / If we could get to the root command... we could introduce an invasive programming sequence through its biochip system... and then return it to the hive.
 GEORDI / (getting it) The Borg are so interconnected it would spread like a virus.
 PICARD / Until it infected the entire Collective. We could disable their neural network in one stroke.
 BEVERLY / Infected... it sounds like you're talking about a disease.
 PICARD / Quite right, Doctor. And if all goes well, a terminal one.
 GEORDI / If this works the way I think it will, once the invasive program starts spreading, it'll only be a matter of months before the Borg suffer total systems failure.
 PICARD / Comments.
 BEVERLY / A question. What, exactly, is "total systems failure?"
 DATA / The Borg are extremely computer-dependent. A total systems failure will destroy them.
 BEVERLY / I just think we should be plain about that. We're talking about annihilating an entire race...
 PICARD / Which under most circumstances would be unconscionable. But as I see it, the Borg leave us little choice.
 RIKER / I agree. We're at war.
 BEVERLY / There's been no formal declaration of war...
 TROI / Not from our side. But certainly from theirs. They've attacked us in every encounter we've had.
 PICARD / They have declared war on our way of life. We are to be assimilated.
 BEVERLY / Even in war, there are rules. You don't kill civilians indiscriminately.
 RIKER / There are no civilians among the Borg.
 PICARD / Think of them as a single, collective being. Any one Borg is no more an individual than your arm or your leg.
 BEVERLY / How convenient.
 PICARD / Your point?
 BEVERLY / When I look at my patient, I don't see a collective consciousness... I don't see a hive... I see a living, breathing boy... who's been hurt and who needs help. And we're talking about sending him back to his people as an instrument of destruction.
 PICARD / It comes down to this: We are faced with an enemy that is determined to destroy us, and with whom we have no hope of negotiating peace. Unless that changes, we are justified in doing anything we can to survive.
 PICARD / Picard, here.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (stands) We will proceed as planned.
 BEVERLY / What's he doing?
 PICARD / Trying to find an access terminal, so he can interface with the collective. He doesn't understand that the signal has been cut off.
 GEORDI / (reading the sensor) He's emitting a homing signal... and a second subspace frequency... but our damping field is blocking both signals.
 PICARD / He's alone. For the first time in his life he's being forced to cope with his environment without the resources of the Collective.
 BEVERLY / He must be hungry.
 BEVERLY / The Borg don't ingest food -- their implants can synthesize any organic molecules their biological tissues require. What they need -- is energy.
 PICARD / Arrange to feed it.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / I'll have to adapt a power conduit and install it in there.
 BEVERLY / If I didn't know better... I'd think he was scared.
 PICARD / Last week when you scored two touches on me, you liked it well enough.
 PICARD / Today your foil was dipping too low... you kept letting me inside.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / I'm not sure. I hope so.
 PICARD / It was an errand of mercy... he was injured, Doctor Crusher decided for humanitarian reasons to care for him --
 PICARD / Shall we go again?
 GEORDI / I'll have to go in... to connect the power conduit.
 WORF / (to Security Guard) I will follow the Commander. Reactivate the field once we're through.
 GEORDI / Good, now just stay there.
 WORF / Commander...
 GEORDI / (without stopping his work) Take a look around, pal, you're not exactly in a position to make demands.
 GEORDI / Who's "we?"
 GEORDI / There's only one of you.
 GEORDI / Do you have a name?
 GEORDI / A means of identification?
 GEORDI / (figuring it out) There were five on your ship... Is that it? Just a number?
 GEORDI / It does kind of suit you.
 GEORDI / This is for you. It regulates the power flow to the frequency you're used to... (indicating) ... and this connection should fit the coupling on your arm.
 GEORDI / You're welcome.
 GEORDI / Let's get out of here.
 WORF / Lower the force field.
 GEORDI / He's hungry all right.
 GEORDI / I'm just a nice guy at heart. Feeling better?
 GEORDI / That's right. And hope to stay that way.
 GEORDI / That's gratitude for you.
 GEORDI / I've been rationing his portions of energy. I think he understands -- if he cooperates, he gets fed. If not... (shrugs)
 BEVERLY / Like a rat in a cage.
 GEORDI / If I'm gonna figure out his command pathways, I have to learn how he processes information. The only way I know to do that is to give him perceptual tests. That means getting his cooperation.
 BEVERLY / So he can participate in the destruction of his entire species.
 GEORDI / (frustrated) Doctor...
 BEVERLY / I know, I know. We're at war.
 BEVERLY / I'm here to help you... but I don't have to like it.
 GEORDI / I think we're ready to transport him. If he gives us any trouble, we can access the force field through this console. (gestures) Ready?
 GEORDI / La Forge to transporter room three. We're ready here.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE / We are standing by, Commander.
 GEORDI / Energize.
 GEORDI / You want some?
 GEORDI / Doctor Crusher, this is Third of Five. Third of Five, this is our ship's doctor.
 BEVERLY / (warmly) Hello.
 BEVERLY / A doctor heals the sick. Repairs the injured.
 BEVERLY / (gently) That didn't happen to you. When we found you, you were dying. I saved your life.
 BEVERLY / That's my duty. To help those who are hurt.
 GEORDI / Right.
 GEORDI / Yeah. That's right.
 GEORDI / Listen, Third of Five... Doctor Crusher here has repaired a lot of the damage to your biochip implants. We want to run a few tests... see if everything is working okay.
 BEVERLY / I'll show you some diagrams... ask you some questions about them... it's very simple, really.
 GEORDI / Right. But before that happens, could we maybe ask you a few questions?
 GEORDI / Terrific. Okay, Third of Five, right over here...
 GEORDI / Designation?
 BEVERLY / You mean our names. We don't have designations -- we have names. I'm Beverly... (points) This is Geordi.
 GEORDI / Do you want one?
 BEVERLY / I'm Beverly, this is Geordi... (points) ... and you...
 BEVERLY / You...
 GEORDI / That's it. Hugh. What do you think?
 GEORDI / Not you... Hugh.
 BEVERLY / All right... I'm Beverly...
 GEORDI / I'm Geordi...
 BEVERLY / Now imagine what this shape would look like if it were turned inside out.
 BEVERLY / Which one is it?
 BEVERLY / That's right. (to Geordi) He's gotten every one -- eight for eight. That blows the top right off the spatial acuity percentiles.
 GEORDI / It's the prosthetic eye... it seems to be giving him very complex visual information...
 BEVERLY / Like some kind of holographic imaging system.
 GEORDI / That could be helpful.
 GEORDI / Hugh, I'd like to take a closer look at your eyepiece. Is that okay?
 GEORDI / Well... thanks.
 BEVERLY / Hugh, do you understand that we don't want to be assimilated?
 BEVERLY / Because... we don't want to live the way you do.
 GEORDI / Other voices?
 BEVERLY / I think what you're saying... is that you're lonely.
 GEORDI / Here you go.
 GEORDI / We'll send you home.
 GEORDI / It's funny... when I first started out, I had no problem with creating this invasive program... but the more I work with Hugh, the more I --
 GEORDI / That's the name we gave him.
 GEORDI / Yeah. (a little defensive) It was easier to have something to call him.
 GEORDI / And... he's not anything like I'd expected.
 GEORDI / I don't know... he's... he just seems like a kid.. a long way from home...
 GEORDI / And now I'm having second thoughts about what we're doing. Programming him like a walking bomb... sending him back to destroy the others...
 GEORDI / Maybe you should go talk to him. It might not seem so clear cut then.
 GEORDI / Then why don't you just listen? That's what you do best, isn't it?
 PICARD / What is it, Number One?
 RIKER / We've picked up a vessel on long range scanners, headed this way.
 PICARD / Analysis.
 DATA / The vessel is traveling at warp seven-point-six. Mass: two-point-five million metric tons, configuration: ...cubical.
 RIKER / The Borg...
 DATA / Its dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to the one that crashed.
 DATA / Interference from the star's radiation will shield us from their sensors. We should remain undetected until they enter this system.
 PICARD / How long do we have?
 DATA / At present speed they will arrive in thirty-one hours, seven minutes.
 GEORDI / Just studying the components in your prosthesis.
 GEORDI / We're just trying to learn more about you.
 GEORDI / You're very different from us. Part of what we do is to learn more about other species.
 GEORDI / Yeah. I know.
 GEORDI / Maybe it is. It's just not what we do.
 GEORDI / Think about it this way. Every time you talk about yourself, you use the word "we." We do this, we do that... you don't know how to think of yourself as a single individual. You don't say, "I want this," or "I am Hugh."
 GEORDI / We are all separate individuals. I am Geordi. I choose what I want to do with my life. I make decisions for myself. For people like me, losing that individuality -- is almost worse than dying.
 GEORDI / No.
 GEORDI / Sometimes. But that's why we have friends.
 GEORDI / Sure. Someone you talk to... who can be with you when you're lonely... who makes you feel better.
 GEORDI / That's it, Captain.
 PICARD / It looks harmless enough.
 GEORDI / We had to disguise it as something innocuous. The Borg have ways of screening out programming anomalies.
 PICARD / How can a geometric form disable a computer system?
 DATA / The shape is a paradox. It cannot exist in real space or time.
 GEORDI / When Hugh's imaging apparatus imprints it on his bio-chips, he'll try to analyze it.
 DATA / He will be unsuccessful, and will store the shape in his memory banks. It will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis.
 GEORDI / When the Borg download his memory, they'll incorporate it into their network. Then they'll try to analyze it.
 DATA / It is designed so that each approach they take will spawn an anomalous solution. The anomalies are designed to interact with each other, linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle.
 PICARD / Quite original. How long before total systems failure?
 GEORDI / Not until the shape has gone through several hundred computational cycles.
 PICARD / When can you begin the process?
 GEORDI / Another twenty hours. Doctor Crusher wants to make sure the new implants have taken hold.
 PICARD / Very well. Proceed as soon as you're ready.
 GEORDI / Captain...
 GEORDI / I have to admit... I've been having second thoughts about this plan.
 PICARD / For what reason?
 GEORDI / Well... I've been getting to know him. The Borg.
 PICARD / I see.
 GEORDI / He's not what I thought he would be, sir. He has feelings... he's homesick... (shaking his head) I don't know... it just seems wrong to use him like this.
 PICARD / Centuries ago, when laboratory animals were used for research... scientists would occasionally become attached to the creatures. That was a problem if the experiment involved killing them. (beat) I would suggest you unattach yourself from the Borg, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / (reluctantly) Aye, Captain.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Guinan... please, come in.
 PICARD / I'm delighted to see you. Would you like something to drink?
 PICARD / A strong forearm is always an advantage in fencing...
 PICARD / Surprised...
 PICARD / If you've come here to persuade me not to use the invasive program...
 PICARD / Two days ago, you were so upset about the Borg even being on the ship that you tore the foil out of my hand. Now you're here questioning whether he should be treated as an enemy.
 PICARD / (after a beat) I haven't talked to him.
 PICARD / I see no need --
 PICARD / It's a Borg, damn it, not a person --!
 PICARD / (fed up) Because he's been given a name by a member of the crew doesn't mean he's no longer Borg. Because he's young doesn't mean he's innocent. He is what he is and in spite of the efforts to turn him into some kind of pet -- I will not alter our plans.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / Yes, Lieutenant.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We are ready to transport.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 PICARD / You may wait outside, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / Yes. I am Locutus... of Borg.
 PICARD / This is a primitive culture. I am here to facilitate its incorporation. Identify yourself.
 PICARD / Identify yourself.
 PICARD / This is not a Borg identification.
 PICARD / This culture will be assimilated.
 PICARD / Irrelevant.
 PICARD / Resistance is futile.
 PICARD / They will be found. It is inevitable. All will be assimilated.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / Then he will die.
 PICARD / You will assist us in assimilating this vessel.
 PICARD / You are Borg. You will assist us.
 PICARD / What did you say?
 PICARD / "I"... ?
 PICARD / But... you are Borg.
 PICARD / ... I think I deliberately avoided speaking with the Borg because I didn't want anything to get in the way of our plan. (beat) But now something has. As far as I can tell, he seems to be a fully realized individual. He has even accepted me as Picard, Captain of this ship, and not as Locutus.
 GEORDI / Then... you've reconsidered the plan?
 PICARD / Yes. If we used him in that manner, we'd be no better than the enemy we seek to destroy. I want other options.
 RIKER / We could return him to the crash site... but we'd have to erase his memories of being on the Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / But... if we erase his memories, then who he is, who he's become, would be destroyed.
 RIKER / Isn't that the point? He'd be reassimilated into the hive without any questions...
 GEORDI / It just seems wrong... we help turn him into an individual... then we take that away from him...
 BEVERLY / Is there a danger that the Borg might destroy him -- if they discover what's happened?
 PICARD / I doubt it. They have nothing to gain by that. It's more likely they'll simply wipe out his memory of this experience.
 RIKER / Then either way his memories will be erased.
 PICARD / But perhaps...
 PICARD / ... in the short time before they purge those memories... the sense of individuality which he has gained here will be transmitted throughout the Collective.
 PICARD / Every one of the Borg will have the opportunity to experience the feeling of... singularity. (MORE)
 PICARD (cont'd) / Perhaps that would be the most pernicious program of all... the knowledge of self, spread through the Borg Collective in that brief moment, might alter them forever.
 PICARD / We will leave his memories intact.
 BEVERLY / I have only one question.
 BEVERLY / What if he doesn't want to go back?
 GEORDI / Hello, Hugh.
 PICARD / Hugh... a Borg rescue vessel is approaching. It will be here within three hours. We can return you to the crash site, where they will find you and take you home.
 PICARD / Or... if you wish, you may remain here with us.
 GEORDI / It's not irrelevant. It matters to us.
 PICARD / Hugh, we'll deal with the repercussions later. What we must know is what you want.
 GEORDI / Don't you understand? We're giving you a choice.
 GEORDI / Yeah. Do you want to go back with the Borg... or stay with us?
 PICARD / Yes. We would grant you asylum.
 GEORDI / Hugh... think about this... are you sure?
 PICARD / (to Hugh) The Borg ship will enter orbit of the moon within an hour. You'll soon be headed home.
 PICARD / We'll beam him down and take position in the star's chromosphere. Its interference will hide us from their sensors.
 BEVERLY / Goodbye, Hugh. I'm very glad I got to know you.
 GEORDI / (to Hugh) It's not too late to change your mind. You can stay here.
 GEORDI / Captain, I'd like to go down with him.
 PICARD / My experience suggests that they would ignore him. (to Hugh) Would you agree?
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) But, Captain, they kidnapped you...
 PICARD / Because they needed a liaison to communicate with Humans. The Borg ignored every away team we sent to their ship, including yours, Doctor.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) You may accompany him.
 PICARD / Goodbye.
 PICARD / Energize.
 GEORDI / (gesturing) We found you there... in the middle of that debris.
 DATA / We are now entering position. Radiation levels are rising.
 PICARD / Increase power to the shields. Hold us here.
 RIKER / Status of the Borg ship?
 DATA / Solar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable. At last known course and speed, the Borg vessel will enter the system in three minutes.
 GEORDI / Well... I guess this is it. (beat) So long, Hugh.
 PICARD, DATA, and TROI at their stations. ENSIGN / McDOWELL is at tactical. The ship is on YELLOW ALERT and there is a sense of urgency in the air.
 PICARD / Time, Mister Data?
 DATA / We will be within transporter range in three minutes twenty-one seconds.
 PICARD / (to com) Romulan ship, this is the Enterprise. We are en route to your position.
 PICARD / Repeat your last transmission.
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge to Commander Riker.
 RIKER and WORF are standing near the platform. GEORDI / and RO ENTER, carrying large tool kits. Everyone has tricorders and phasers. CHIEF BROSSMER, a woman in her forties, is standing behind the console.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker here.
 PICARD / Number One... transport to the Romulan vessel as soon as we're in range.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. (to others) No weapons. We don't want them to think they're under attack.
 RIKER / (sharp) I beg your pardon, Ensign. I didn't quite catch that.
 RIKER / We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We received your distress call.
 RIKER / That's right. Your message said you'd suffered a failure in your engine core.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Commander?
 GEORDI / (re: equipment) It's a pretty strange set-up, but I think the graviton field generator has completely depolarized. We can't fix it, it has to be replaced.
 RIKER / (to Romulans) Where are your replicators?
 RIKER / Who's in charge here?
 RIKER / (urgent) We'd like to take the generator back to the Enterprise for replication.
 RIKER / Geordi, you and Ro.
 GEORDI / (hits combadge) La Forge to Brossmer. Two people, one piece of equipment to beam aboard.
 RIKER / (urgent, to com) Chief, they're not here. Do you have them?
 RIKER / Where are they?
 PICARD / Begin a level one diagnostic. All transporter systems to remain off-line until further notice. (to Data) Could they have materialized somewhere else?
 DATA / (off console) Negative, Captain. Sensors are unable to find them within transporter range.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Counselor?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Enterprise.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER / Captain, we're still looking at a core breach unless we can fashion a new graviton generator. I need... (beat, then bluntly) I need replacement personnel, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data, you may continue your diagnostic of the transporter system later. Take a shuttlecraft and two more engineers to the Romulan ship.
 DATA / (on the move) Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to McDowell) Mister McDowell, alert the main shuttlebay to have all available ships and pilots standing by in case we need them.
 PICARD / (to Conn Officer) Lay in a course to take us away from the Romulan ship at Warp One in case it explodes.
 RIKER / (to Mirok) What can we do to stop the overload?
 WORF / (to Riker) Emergency bulkheads have sealed this section from the rest of the ship. There is no way to gain access to the bridge or other control centers.
 RIKER / Survivors?
 WORF / Readings indicate at least seventy-three Romulans are still alive.
 RIKER / We'll have to dump the entire engine core. Do you have an auto-eject system?
 RIKER / Worf, you two seal the chamber.
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Riker to Enterprise. We're preparing to jettison the engine core. We'll need you to extend shields once it clears the hull.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Understood, Number One. We'll stand by for your signal.
 WORF / Commander!
 RIKER / (as he pulls on beam, to Varel) Time?
 RIKER / (straining against door) Stay there! Eject the chamber on my order!
 DATA / (o.c.) Excuse me, sir.
 RIKER / (to Mirok) Now!
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Enterprise, extend shields!
 RIKER / (to Mirok) Well... we're still here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We'll have a complete power survey done within the hour... we'll probably have to supply them with energy for life support... and they're definitely going to need a new engine core to get home again.
 PICARD / (to com) Understood, Commander. Keep us informed of your efforts. Picard out. (to McDowell) I'll be in sickbay.
 BEVERLY / The transporter could've beamed them somewhere else... the Romulan ship, another deck of the Enterprise...
 PICARD / (gently) We've already checked those possibilities. (beat) The preliminary findings indicate there was a radiation surge from the Romulan engine core which disrupted the signal. They never rematerialized.
 BEVERLY / We should check again, there might be something we overlooked and---
 PICARD / (gentle, but firm) We've done all we can, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / You're right. I just... hate making out death certificates. (beat) Did Ensign Ro have any family?
 PICARD / (to Beverly) None that I know of, but I'll check with the Bajoran Liaison Office.
 BEVERLY / (resigned) I'll have the official reports ready within the hour.
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Riker to Enterprise. Begin power transfer.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Riker.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker here. The power transfer appears stable at this end, Captain.
 PICARD / Good. What is the status of their engine replacement?
 RIKER / Engineering is modifying one of our subspace resonators to act as a new engine core. It won't do more than warp two, but it'll get them home.
 PICARD / Very well.
 DATA / Captain...
 DATA / The diagnostic of the transporter system shows an anomalous energy fluctuation. I will need to inspect the imaging scanners in transporter room three.
 PICARD / By all means.
 DATA / Captain --
 DATA / I have a personal favor to ask. (beat) I considered Commander La Forge to be my best friend. I feel it is my responsibility to plan and conduct the memorial service. May I have your permission to do so?
 PICARD / Permission granted. Make whatever arrangements you find appropriate.
 DATA / Thank you, sir.
 WORF / Commander...
 RIKER / Problem, Mister Worf?
 WORF / The Romulans want a computer. We cannot give them access to Federation technology. It is an unacceptable security risk.
 RIKER / What about a computer from thirty or forty years ago... one the Romulans are already familiar with?
 WORF / That would be satisfactory.
 RIKER / Check with the Enterprise to see what's available. But be sure your security concerns are addressed before we install it.
 WORF / Aye, sir. (beat) Thank you.
 GEORDI / (relieved) Ro -- boy, am I glad to see you... and I'm really glad you can see me.
 GEORDI / It's like I'm here, but... I'm not here.
 GEORDI / I can't figure out what happened. One minute we were transporting from the Romulan ship... the next I just... woke up in the arboretum with a splitting headache. (beat) Can you... pass through things like bulkheads --
 GEORDI / Well... we're solid enough to each other.
 GEORDI / What do you mean?
 GEORDI / (shocked) What?
 GEORDI / Is that some kind of joke?
 GEORDI / Wait a minute... (clearly) What are you saying... that we're spirits?
 GEORDI / (disbelieving) My uniform... my VISOR... you're saying I'm a blind ghost with clothes?
 GEORDI / We are not dead.
 GEORDI / (firm) No. You may be ready for the afterlife, but I'm not.
 GEORDI / Fine. You go make peace with yourself. I'm going to transporter room three to find a way out of this... situation.
 DATA / I believe the cause of the accident may be related to the explosion on the Romulan ship.
 GEORDI / Oh, yeah?
 DATA / In all likelihood the explosion damaged the Romulan cloaking device, causing it to discharge chroniton particles. (sweeping with tricorder) I am detecting a chroniton field in here.
 GEORDI / A chroniton field...
 GEORDI / The transporter beam --
 DATA / I suspect they travelled through the transporter beam. That may have been the cause of Geordi and Ro's death.
 DATA / I will go to the Romulan ship and see if I can discover the source of these emissions.
 DATA / They pose no danger to Humans -- but some of the ship's systems may be affected by prolonged exposure. When I return I will devise a method to eradicate them.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Ensign Ro...
 RIKER / (to Picard, on the move) There are a lot of what appear to be experimental engine components lying around over there. I'd say they were testing some new warp drive design and it blew up in their faces.
 PICARD / (nods) That would explain why they're this far away from Romulan space... to avoid being picked up on Federation long-range scanners.
 RIKER / We should have an engine core ready for them by nineteen hundred hours.
 PICARD / Commander... there will be a memorial service at twenty-three hundred hours this evening. Mister Data is making the arrangements.
 RIKER / I'll be there.
 RIKER / In fact... I might like to say a few words.
 PICARD / (acknowledging) You knew La Forge longer than any of us.
 RIKER / Actually, I was thinking more of Ensign Ro...
 PICARD / Coordinate with Mister Data.
 GEORDI (o.c.) / There you are.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) Excuse me, Captain. (to Ro) Data is taking the next shuttle back to the Romulan ship and we've got to be on it.
 GEORDI / I think we'll find the answer to what's happened to us over there.
 GEORDI / (urgent) Look, if you're right and we're dead this won't make any difference. But if I'm right, then we're still alive... and I'm going to need your help.
 DATA / Lieutenant, I am planning a memorial service for Commander La Forge and Ensign Ro. I would like you to participate.
 WORF / What kind of service?
 DATA / Captain Picard asked me to arrange a ceremony that is appropriate. I have given a great deal of thought as to what is "appropriate" in this instance.
 WORF / Sir, shuttlecraft four has not cleared the Romulan ship yet.
 DATA / Hold position here.
 GEORDI / This is a little weird... listening to them plan our funeral...
 DATA / I find that I am having difficulty deciding what kind of service to have. Do you have any suggestions?
 WORF / Human custom is to conduct a solemn, dignified service in which the dead are praised by their friends and loved ones.
 DATA / Ensign Ro was Bajoran. Her beliefs should be reflected as well. But their death rituals are quite complicated.
 WORF / The Bajorn Death Chant is over two hours long...
 DATA / I am not certain that either Human or Bajoran rites are fitting... and I have researched the funerary customs of over five thousand cultures to no avail...
 WORF / Shuttlecraft four has cleared...
 DATA / Resume course.
 DATA / In almost all societies it is traditional to say a ritual farewell to those you call friends. (beat) I did not know what a friend was until I met Geordi. He spoke to me as though I were Human... he treated me no differently from anyone else. He accepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. I would like this service to reflect that friendship. (beat) But I do not know how to say goodbye.
 WORF / Commander, I am not the proper person to advise you.
 DATA / Why not?
 WORF / (hesitant) I am very happy for Commander La Forge. He has crossed to... that which is beyond. For a Klingon, this is a joyful time... a friend has died in the line of duty... and he has earned a place among the honored dead. It is not a time to mourn.
 DATA / Begin docking procedure.
 GEORDI / Data -- I appreciate the sentiment. But you're a little premature. I don't intend to get commemorated before my time.
 DATA / Chroniton emissions may have been responsible for the accident which claimed the lives of our officers.
 DATA / Was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion?
 DATA / Then that explains the chroniton fields I am detecting here. (beat, as he scans) For your own safety, it is important to eliminate the emissions.
 DATA / There is no way to predict what might happen when the chronitons interact with the new engine core.
 GEORDI / I've never seen anything like this. There's something in there that looks like a molecular phase inverter...
 GEORDI / It's supposed to change the structure of matter so it can... pass through "normal" matter and energy... hey, wait a minute...
 GEORDI / A few years back, we got intelligence reports that the Klingons were working on combining a phase inverter and a cloaking device. In theory, they believed that a... phased ship could hide anywhere... even inside a planet. And conventional weapons would be useless against it.
 GEORDI / It never got out of the preliminary stages... there were several accidents. The Romulans might be pursuing the same technology -- trying to combine an inverter and a cloaking device. (looks at console) If this is the prototype...
 GEORDI / And us.
 GEORDI / Not just cloaked -- phased... our molecular structure altered so we have no substance.
 GEORDI / It also means -- there might be a way we can decloak.
 DATA / The field emissions are particularly strong here.
 WORF / (from far side of room) Commander, may I speak with you?
 GEORDI / We have to get back to the Enterprise and warn them.
 GEORDI / I don't know, but we have to find a way. Come on.
 GEORDI / (frustrated) The Romulans must be hiding it in the sensor return signal. Unless someone runs a level three diagnostic, they'll never see it.
 GEORDI / There has to be a way to warn them before the ship goes to warp.
 DATA / (to Brossmer) This is puzzling. Three more chroniton fields have formed aboard the Enterprise in the last hour.
 GEORDI / (to Ro) There's no reason why the interphase device would be producing new fields aboard this ship.
 DATA / (to Brossmer) We should begin decontamination immediately. Run an internal sensor sweep for the locations of all chroniton fields on the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / Ro, listen to that...
 DATA / (puzzled) I do not understand how these new fields have formed. No transporter beam has been active in any of those areas. And I do not see that they have anything in common...
 GEORDI / Oh, yes they do...
 DATA / They seem to be appearing at random.
 GEORDI / No, they're not. (to Ro) We were in every one of those locations. Somehow we're leaving... chroniton footprints behind us.
 DATA / Can you narrow the focus of the scan to pinpoint the locations?
 DATA / (to Brossmer) Go to science station two on the bridge and use the lateral sensor array to get a more precise reading. I will modify an anyon emitter to eliminate the fields once they have been isolated.
 GEORDI / (urgent, to Ro) You go with her and see what the lateral sensors turn up. I'll stay here with Data.
 GEORDI / That's interesting... you're picking up chroniton readings in here, but not from me.
 GEORDI / There's a field in this wall? Why?
 GEORDI / (getting excited) Data, I came through this wall. I walked right through it when I came in here...
 GEORDI / Data, I'm right here... that's me you're reading...
 GEORDI / Come on... it's me...
 GEORDI / Stop being so rational... use your imagination for a change... these aren't just random patterns... it's me!
 GEORDI / Hey, watch where you point that thing.
 GEORDI / Wait a minute, Data... you did something to me...
 GEORDI / It's not so easy to push through any more...
 GEORDI / That means the molecules in my hand must have been partially dephased by the anyon beam... (getting excited) Data, if the low-level beam brought my hand part of the way back... maybe a high-level beam would bring me all the way back. (determined) I've got to get you to turn up the beam intensity so that...
 GEORDI / Hey, don't stop now.
 GEORDI / (urgent) No, no, no. Don't give up on it... it works, I was just creating more fields. Your method is fine... just turn up the intensity...
 GEORDI / (puzzled) Is that Ro... ?
 DATA / (to com) Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / RO!
 DATA / (over action) Excuse me for interrupting, Lieutenant. I have detected a chroniton field in this room. May I scan the area for a moment?
 GEORDI / Any time.
 DATA / (to Man) Your room is heavily contaminated with chronitons. This will only take a moment.
 GEORDI / (worried) There's still no indication that the Romulans set up a muon wave in our dilithium chamber.
 PICARD / On screen.
 GEORDI / (frustrated) Now what?
 PICARD / Understood. (to McDowell) Disconnect the power transfer beam.
 PICARD / It was our pleasure, Mirok. I hope that this example of cooperation between our two people is not an isolated incident.
 PICARD / (to Con Officer) Set a course for the Garadius system. (raises his hand) Warp six...
 GEORDI / (urgent) No, Captain -- wait --
 PICARD / Very well. Let me know when your sweep is finished.
 GEORDI / The beam strength would have to be pretty strong for us to become visible for more than a millisecond. Someone would have to be looking right at us.
 RIKER / Captain... it's time. We'd better go.
 PICARD / Mister McDowell, you have the bridge. I'll be... at the service in Ten Forward.
 GEORDI / (quickly to Ro) Ten Forward. That's perfect. (on the move) We'll create as many chroniton fields in there as we can... get them to flood the room with a stronger beam.
 PICARD / Deck Ten.
 PICARD / I've been thinking about the first time I met Geordi La Forge. He was a young officer assigned to pilot me on an inspection tour... I made some off-hand remark about the shuttle's engine efficiency not being what it should... the next morning I found he'd stayed up all night refitting the fusion initiators. (beat) I knew right then that I wanted him with me on my next command.
 PICARD / Have you decided what you're going to say about Ensign Ro?
 RIKER / Yeah, I have. It wasn't easy...
 GEORDI / It's our memorial service.
 GEORDI / Why not?
 GEORDI / (pleased) Yeah. It's perfect.
 GEORDI / Come on... let's get started.
 PICARD / Well. This is... unusual.
 RIKER / Yeah... but I think I like it.
 DATA / But... do you think the others will think this service is -- appropriate?
 BEVERLY / Look around you, Data. People are sharing memories of Geordi and Ro... talking, laughing... I don't know what could be more appropriate.
 DATA / I am glad you approve, Doctor.
 DATA / Go ahead, Chief.
 DATA / No. Anyonic emissions are harmless. Please begin immediately.
 GEORDI / Here we go...
 GEORDI / Worf! Worf, can you see me?
 PICARD / (to Beverly) ... if she hadn't lost her rank following the incident at Garon Four, I think she would've made lieutenant commander by now.
 PICARD / (to com) Go ahead.
 PICARD / Stand by, Ensign.
 GEORDI / (urgent) We've got to do something now, before they go to warp.
 GEORDI / Do it.
 PICARD / Excuse me, Mister Data. (Data turns)
 PICARD / (over action) I'd like to get under way as soon as possible. The situation on Garadius Four is becoming serious.
 DATA / I see no reason to delay our departure, Captain. The chroniton fields have been cleared from all critical areas.
 PICARD / Excellent.
 PICARD / (hits combadge) Mister McDowell, set course for Gardius Four and engage at---
 DATA / (puzzled by this) Curious. (to Picard) I believe it would be best if we decontaminate this room before getting underway, sir.
 PICARD / Very well.
 DATA / (to com) Chief Brossmer, increase anyonic emissions to six thousand particles per second and decontaminate the area.
 GEORDI / (to Ro) Hang on.
 GEORDI / Data, we're here! Can you see us?
 PICARD / (to Data) Did you see that?
 DATA / (puzzled) Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / Come on, Data... put it together now...
 PICARD / It wasn't ghosts, Mister Data... what did we see?
 DATA / Captain, I may know what has happened...
 GEORDI / Please be right, Data...
 DATA / (musing, half to himself) ... it would explain the mysterious chroniton fields...
 DATA / ... if they were cloaked in some way...
 PICARD / Are you saying you think they're still alive?
 DATA / If I am right, they are -- and in this room. Their brief appearance coincided with the anyonic sweep. Perhaps the anyons neutralize the cloaking effect. (touches combadge) Data to Chief Brossmer. Set the anoynic beam to its highest level and flood Ten Forward.
 GEORDI / (urgent, to Data) Data -- Can you see me?
 DATA / (simply) Of course.
 GEORDI / (hits badge) La Forge to engineering. Take the warp engines off-line until further notice. (to Data) There's a muon wave build-up in the dilithium chamber.
 PICARD / (to com) That was Commander Geordi La Forge, Ensign. Please follow his instructions.
 GEORDI / Looks like a great party. Mind if we join you?
 GEORDI / Could you pass the rolls?
 GEORDI / We didn't have anything to eat for almost two days. I'm starved.
 GEORDI / What's wrong?
 GEORDI / Maybe we should develop our own interphase device... (off her look) ... if it can teach Ro Laren humility, it can do anything.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45944.1. We're en route to Starbase Two-eighteen after a magnetic wave survey of the Parvenium Sector. We will give our report directly to Fleet Admiral Gustafson.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, and GEORDI at their / positions; N.D.'s as necessary. There is a light-hearted mood on the bridge.
 PICARD / The last time I encountered Admiral Gustafson... I ended up spending nine straight hours at the opera.
 GEORDI / Nine hours... ?
 PICARD / The entire "Ring" cycle at one sitting...
 RIKER / That's a little too much Wagner for me.
 PICARD / And for me... but not, apparently, for Admiral Gustafson. She went back the next day and sat through it all again. I warned her that this time --
 WORF / Sir, sensors detect an unidentified object... twenty-two thousand kilometers off the port quarter.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / It appears to be a probe of some kind... but there is no Starfleet record of this shape or design.
 RIKER / Is it scanning us?
 WORF / No sir... but it has assumed a relative position and is holding course with us.
 DATA / The probe is composed of... paricium and talgonite... a ceramic alloy.
 GEORDI / Not a very sophisticated technology...
 WORF / Sir, I'm detecting a low-level nucleonic beam coming from the probe.
 RIKER / Shields up; stand by phasers.
 DATA / The beam is scanning the shield's perimeter. (frowns) The probe is emitting an unusual particle stream --
 WORF / Captain, the beam is penetrating our shields --
 PICARD / Increase power to --
 RIKER / Captain?...
 RIKER / Captain, I've got you; it's all...
 PICARD / Where is this... ?
 PICARD / Computer, freeze program. (beat) End program.
 PICARD / Picard to Enterprise --
 PICARD / I asked you... what is this place?
 PICARD / Where is my uniform? My communicator?
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. I would like to speak with whoever is in charge here.
 PICARD / Just tell me this -- am I a prisoner here?
 PICARD / Are you in charge here?
 PICARD / I want to be returned to my ship immediately.
 PICARD / Please... if you could tell me... what is this place? Where am I?
 PICARD / That must be it. Perhaps you could help me...
 PICARD / My name is Kamin... and you are -- ?
 PICARD / Ah. And you say I've been ill...
 PICARD / Eline.
 PICARD / And... what is this place?
 PICARD / Please -- I'm sure it will come back to me...
 PICARD / What planet?
 PICARD / I'm really quite all right. If you'll just answer...
 PICARD / Kataan... not a Federation planet.
 PICARD / I think I'll take a walk...
 PICARD / Exercise will do me good. I'd like to -- re-acquaint myself with the surroundings.
 PICARD / Hungry, thirsty... weary... I suppose that proves this isn't a dream, doesn't it?
 PICARD / It's not my life... I know that much.
 PICARD / I walked. For hours.
 PICARD / This is delicious...
 PICARD / Would you -- answer some questions for me? No matter how strange they might seem to you?
 PICARD / Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit any other systems... ?
 PICARD / All right. Is there any kind of communication system here? How do you send messages to... to other communities? Other places?
 PICARD / Yes. When can that be arranged?
 PICARD / Of course. Anything you can tell me would be helpful. We are... married?
 PICARD / What is it that I do... here in Ressik?
 PICARD / The flute?
 PICARD / And when did I learn to play it?
 PICARD / I see what you mean.
 PICARD / Thank you for the soup. And for your help. Tomorrow will you help me send a message?
 PICARD / I'll sleep here...
 PICARD / I've been sick... I may be tossing and turning... it wouldn't be fair to you.
 PICARD (o.s.) / Where did you get this?
 RIKER / ... I've got you; it's all right...
 RIKER / Riker to sickbay. The captain's been hurt.
 DATA / The nucleonic beam is no longer scanning, Commander. There is a narrow reciprocating band focused directly on Captain Picard.
 RIKER / Mister Data, find out how that beam is getting through the shields and what we can do to cut it off.
 DATA / Yes, Commander.
 RIKER / Geordi, start scanning the probe for any identifying marks, anything that might tell us where it came from.
 GEORDI / Understood.
 BEVERLY / Pulse and blood pressure normal... I'm getting hyperactive fibrogenic activity... this is odd...
 RIKER / What is it?
 BEVERLY / There's no evidence of injury or trauma... vital signs are normal, but his neurotransmitter production is off the scale. What's going on?
 RIKER / That probe is doing something to him... Data, any progress?
 DATA / No, sir. The particle emission is most unusual. I am unable to block it.
 WORF / Destroy the probe. Phasers are armed and ready.
 BEVERLY / (as she begins scanning) I don't think that's wise. Not until we know exactly what it's doing to him...
 RIKER / Agreed. Stand down phasers, Mister Worf.
 RIKER / In the meantime, let's see if we can move out of range. Ensign, thrusters only... one hundred kph... nice and easy...
 RIKER / Mister Data?
 DATA / The probe is moving with us, sir -- holding relative position.
 BEVERLY / It's connected itself to him... like a tether.
 PICARD / I'm just charting the sun's movements. It might give some clues to the cause of this drought.
 PICARD / The memory's five years old now, but it's still inside me. (shrugs) My other existence may be gone, but I still wonder about it.
 PICARD / Eline...
 PICARD / It was real... as real as this is. You can't expect me to forget the lifetime I spent there...
 PICARD / I know this has been hard for you...
 PICARD / You have been amazingly tolerant.
 PICARD / Good morning, Batai...
 PICARD / Yes... (to Eline) Will you come along?
 PICARD / It isn't her fault. These last few years have been difficult for her.
 PICARD / If the weather pattern doesn't change, rationing won't be enough. We will run out of water.
 PICARD / No. I haven't spoken to you before.
 PICARD / I suggest we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the air.
 PICARD / Iron weaving. (beat) And playing the flute.
 PICARD / Each community would be responsible for its own. These condensers could mean the difference between watering our crops... or watching them die.
 PICARD / We'll never see an atmospheric condenser...
 PICARD / Come to dinner tonight, my friend. I'll make a vegetable stew. We'll talk about building our own condenser.
 PICARD / I'm not brooding. I'm immersed in my music.
 PICARD / (re: flute) I've found it helps me think. (a smile) The real surprise is that I enjoy it so much.
 PICARD / Goodnight, my friend.
 PICARD / Yes, ma'am.
 PICARD / I'm the one who's sorry. (beat) Everything you said this morning was absolutely right.
 PICARD / I've given you so little... and you have given me so much... tenderness, patience... and a good talking to when I needed it. (beat) You've been more than I could ever have hoped for. More than I deserve.
 PICARD / Not such a wonderful husband.
 PICARD / I spend my spare time charting the stars... I disappear for days at a time exploring the countryside... and I never put away my shoes. I lead my life very much as I did -- before. (quick glance at her) Old habits.
 PICARD / I'd like to ask your permission to build something.
 PICARD / In this case, I think I do.
 PICARD / A nursery.
 PICARD / Unless you'd rather have a porch. It'd certainly be easier to build...
 BEVERLY / (to the team) He's showing heightened activity in the cerebral cortex...
 BEVERLY / Systemic activity?
 BEVERLY / Set up a galvanic scan.
 RIKER / Geordi, any progress identifying the probe?
 GEORDI / Maybe. I've picked up some residue on the probe's shell. I think it's from the propulsion system. Looks like it used a solid propellant as fuel.
 RIKER / Solid propellant?
 GEORDI / Sensors read this stuff as crystalline emiristol. It produces a radioactive trail that ought to be traceable.
 RIKER / Then we can send out a probe of our own. Trace it back to the point of origin.
 GEORDI / I'll get on it.
 DATA / Commander, I have been analyzing the nucleonic beam. I believe it would be possible to reflect the particles back toward the probe in a way that would disrupt the signal.
 RIKER / Doctor... ?
 BEVERLY / I don't know what it's doing to him, or what'll happen if we stop it...
 RIKER / He could be dying by inches...
 BEVERLY / His vital signs are stable. There's no indication he's in a life-threatening situation --
 RIKER / I'm not willing to let that thing keep drilling into him --
 BEVERLY / I simply don't know the risk of shutting down the beam. If someone gets stabbed, you don't necessarily pull the knife out right away -- that might do more harm than leaving it there.
 WORF / The captain is under attack. We must act.
 RIKER / I'm inclined to agree. Doctor, monitor him closely. Mister Data, prepare to disrupt the beam. We're going to try to cut this cord.
 PICARD / We name this child for a dear friend who died last year... but who will now live on through his namesake.
 PICARD / He's starting life in the warmth of friends. Thank you. (re: long table) Please, help yourselves to something to eat.
 PICARD / I remember. I was so nervous I thought I might drop her. (beat) Now look at her... a little lady...
 PICARD / (an admission) I'd always thought I didn't need children to make my life complete... now, I can't imagine life without them.
 BEVERLY / I'm losing him!
 BEVERLY / Two cc's delactovine...
 RIKER / Data, get that beam back.
 BEVERLY / Begin full cardiac induction...
 BEVERLY / Data, you have to reestablish that beam.
 DATA / I am attempting to do so, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / Cortical stimulator...
 BEVERLY / Start at ten percent...
 DATA / Doctor, the beam is fully restored.
 BEVERLY / Isocortical functions are stabilizing... vital signs approaching normal levels...
 PICARD (o.c.) / Meribor... ?
 PICARD / That's my hobby; find your own.
 PICARD / And what has the scientist been up to today?
 PICARD / I haven't reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn't function by conjecture.
 PICARD / (beat) Tell me... why don't you spend more time with that young fellow Dannick?
 PICARD / I'm not; I'm hypothesizing that he's in love with you.
 PICARD / Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns... games and toys and clothes...
 PICARD / No... but it saddens me to see you bear the burden of knowing things... things you can't change.
 PICARD / But I'm not sixteen. With my life ahead of me.
 PICARD / I can only say... (Beat) ... Live now, Meribor. Always make "now" the most precious time. "Now" will not come again.
 BEVERLY / Vital signs are holding... he's been stable ever since the beam was restored. (beat) I don't know what more to do for him.
 GEORDI / Commander, we're starting to receive telemetry from the probe we launched.
 RIKER / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / (off console) We've charted the alien probe's radiation trail for just over one light year.
 RIKER / Can you extrapolate a point of origin?
 GEORDI / Our best guess would be a star system in the Silarian sector... Kataan.
 RIKER / Kataan... I've never heard of it. Data... ?
 DATA / It is an unmapped system of six planets.
 RIKER / Any of them inhabited?
 DATA / Not any longer, sir. The star went nova. All life in the system was destroyed approximately one thousand years ago.
 PICARD / Ah. Thank you, dear.
 PICARD / Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and rest the way you're supposed to.
 PICARD / He loves doing a lot of things -- too many. One week he wants to be a botanist, the next week a sculptor. I wish he could find some focus in his life.
 PICARD / (calling) Batai?
 PICARD / I get the feeling from your mother that you have something to tell me.
 PICARD / Leaving school -- ? No, you're not --
 PICARD / Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. A year before that it was botany. Now --
 PICARD / We'll... we'll discuss it.
 PICARD / If music is what he wants... why should I stand in his way? (beat) Who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream.
 PICARD / Yes. (beat) It's possible he'll dismiss me from the Council.
 PICARD / The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent.
 PICARD / (brandishing journal) The facts are here. At least show them to someone who will recognize what they mean.
 PICARD / If you won't take them, I most certainly will.
 PICARD / Surely the technology exists to save something of this world... perhaps some people could be evacuated...
 PICARD / A collection of genetic samples, then -- something, anything -- you can't just let this civilization die --
 PICARD / What is it -- ?
 PICARD / Doctor -- ?
 PICARD / (in kind) You always had a flair for the dramatic...
 PICARD / He didn't have to. They already know.
 PICARD / (small smile) No...
 PICARD / I will.
 BEVERLY / What is it?
 BEVERLY / (moving to monitor) So are his respiratory functions.
 RIKER / Is he in danger?
 BEVERLY / I don't know... I don't understand what's happening. The changes are subtle, but...
 BEVERLY / ... If I didn't know better, I'd say these are the metabolic rates of an eighty-year-old man.
 PICARD / You shouldn't be out there for so long. It's damaging, you know that.
 PICARD / Mmnph. (to Kamie) Do you wear your skin protector outdoors, young man?
 PICARD / What "launching"? What's he talking about?
 PICARD / Are we, indeed. I'm not going anywhere to watch anything.
 PICARD / (looking after them) Breaks my heart to look at him...
 PICARD / My grandson. Breaks my heart... he deserves a full rich life, and he's not going to get one.
 PICARD / Why didn't I hear anything about a launching?
 PICARD / Did everyone know about this except me?
 PICARD / I can see all right from here.
 PICARD / You go on with the others. Go hold onto my grandson, and watch the damned thing go up... for all the good it'll do. What is it they're launching?
 PICARD / Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven't seen any missile.
 PICARD / (in disbelief) Batai?
 PICARD / A probe... that encounters someone...
 PICARD / ... someone in the future... (realizing) ... it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone...
 PICARD / I'm the one it finds... that's what this launching is -- a probe that finds me... in the future...
 PICARD / Eline...
 PICARD / Eline...
 BEVERLY (o.s.) / Something's happening...
 DATA / The nucleonic beam has ceased, Commander. The probe has shut down.
 BEVERLY / His cerebral functions are stabilizing.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on the probe. I want it in shuttlebay two for examination.
 WORF / Yes, Commander.
 PICARD / (very weak) What...
 BEVERLY / Please, Captain... don't get up too quickly...
 PICARD / How long? How long have I been... like this?
 RIKER / At least twenty, maybe twenty-five minutes.
 PICARD / (lost) Twenty-five minutes?
 BEVERLY / Captain, I need you in sickbay now. I want to run a full diagnostic.
 PICARD / Very well, Doctor. But as soon as you're done... I have a great deal to tell you.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Hello, sir. Feeling better?
 PICARD / Yes, thank you... but I find I'm having to remind myself that this -- (gesturing) -- is really my home.
 RIKER / We were able to open the probe and examine it. Whatever it was that locked onto you must have been self-terminating. It isn't functional any longer.
 RIKER / We found this inside.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45959.1. The Enterprise has been recalled to sector zero zero one on a priority mission.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) All we've been told is that evidence has been discovered indicating the presence of extraterrestrials on Earth... five centuries ago.
 PICARD and DATA move down a tunnel illuminated by / mining lights... a SCIENTIST, male, late forties, leads the way...
 PICARD / And it's been determined that they date back to the late nineteenth century... ?
 DATA / (studying them) The biofocal vision aide is typical of the era... the weapon is a forty-five caliber single action cavalry pistol invented by Colt Firearms in 1873.
 PICARD / What makes you think extraterrestrials are related to this discovery...
 DATA / The composition of the exposed rockface has been altered by exposure to triolic waves...
 PICARD / Triolic waves?
 DATA / The byproduct of an energy source employed by very few species because of its deleterious effects on living tissue...
 PICARD / I'm curious, Doctor. There are far greater experts on Earth who could investigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, stardate 45960.2. We have transported the materials discovered in the cavern back to the ship for analysis. I wish I could be as dispassionate about the implications as my second officer...
 DATA / Interesting... there has been a twelve percent decomposition of the bitanium in the neural pathway links... it suggests the alloys are vulnerable to...
 RIKER / Data...
 DATA / Yessir... ?
 RIKER / How can you look inside that... and analyze the decomposition... without... without...
 DATA / Emotion, sir?
 RIKER / ... without, I don't know...
 DATA / I am simply trying to make an objective assessment.
 PICARD / Is it... yours, Data?
 DATA / I am quite certain that it is, Captain.
 PICARD / Could it be Lore?
 DATA / My brother's positronic brain had a type L phase-discriminating amplifier... mine is type R.
 PICARD / (re: the head) Type R?
 DATA / (acknowledging) Yessir.
 PICARD / Can you determine how long it has been in the cavern?
 DATA / (glances at Riker) As I was going to say, the decomposition strongly indicates that life was terminated approximately five hundred years ago. That would be consistent with the other artifacts recovered.
 RIKER / Your head is not an artifact.
 DATA / In relative terms, perhaps not. Nevertheless, it seems clear that my life is to end in the late nineteenth century.
 RIKER / Not if we can help it.
 DATA / (curious) There is nothing anyone can do to prevent it, sir. (MORE)
 DATA (cont'd) / At some future date, I will be transported back to nineteenth century Earth... where I will die. It has occurred. It will occur.
 The ease with which he speaks it is unnerving. GEORDI, who has been working in another part of / engineering, moves to them...
 GEORDI / I can't tell you exactly who the aliens were... but I have found out a few things...
 GEORDI / The triolicized rock face tells us we're probably dealing with a species with microcentrum cell membranes. Triolic waves wouldn't harm them. Also might mean they're shape shifters of some kind...
 RIKER / So they could have appeared as Humans on Earth...
 GEORDI / (nods) I don't think it's anyone we've run into before... nothing we found matches up with any known lifeform...
 GEORDI / What does match up... is a cellular fossil that might have just come along for the ride...
 PICARD / Cellular fossil... ?
 GEORDI / A microscopic ciliated lifeform... not that different from a thousand other single cell lifeforms that you'd find on any planet surface... except this particular one is L-B-one-zero-four-four-five... and L-B-one-zero-four-four-five is only known to exist on one planet... Devidia Two in the Marrab sector...
 PICARD / Number One, lay in a course...
 RIKER / Aye, sir...
 GEORDI / So?
 DATA / I have no reference point by which your question can be answered.
 GEORDI / So... do you feel like talking about it?
 DATA / Are you referring to the foreknowledge of my death?
 GEORDI / Yeah.
 DATA / I have no particular desire to discuss the matter. (beat) Do you feel like talking about it?
 GEORDI / Yeah.
 DATA / Why?
 GEORDI / Data... it's gotta bother you a little...
 DATA / On the contrary, I find it rather... comforting.
 GEORDI / (surprised) Comforting...
 DATA / I have often wondered about my own mortality as I have seen others age around me... Until now, it has been theoretically possible that I would live an unlimited period of time. And although some might find this attractive, to me it only reinforces the fact that I am... artificial.
 GEORDI / I never realized... how tough all this must be for you...
 DATA / "Tough"?
 GEORDI / Knowing that you would outlive all your friends.
 DATA / (blind to sentiment) I expected to make new friends.
 GEORDI / True.
 DATA / And then outlive them as well.
 GEORDI / Now that you know you might not...
 DATA / ... it provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I am not so different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death.
 GEORDI / I never thought of it that way.
 DATA / One might even conclude that it brings me one step closer to being Human. I am mortal.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to bridge officers... we're approaching the Devidia system... report to your stations...
 GEORDI / See you later... let's get together for a game of chess or something, okay?
 GEORDI / Yeah... talking about life, death, the future...
 GEORDI / Naw. Somebody's gonna die.
 GEORDI / They found Data's head a mile below San Francisco... been down there for five centuries...
 GEORDI / Yeah, something, isn't it?
 GEORDI / (continuing) He seems fine about it... better than I am... (stands) I better get to engineering...
 TROI / I heard about Data.
 RIKER / Yeah.
 TROI / It's having an unusually traumatic effect on everyone.
 RIKER / Yeah.
 TROI / If you don't want to talk about it, it's okay.
 RIKER / I'm fine. I'm just...
 TROI / ...angry.
 RIKER / No not angry. (beat, realizing she's right) Yeah, angry. Why should I be angry?
 TROI / Maybe it reminds us all of our own mortality.
 RIKER / I just don't want to believe it.
 TROI / (beat) Have you ever heard Data define friendship?
 RIKER / No...
 TROI / How did he put it... something like... (Data impression) "As I experience certain sensory input patterns my mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs eventually are anticipated and even 'missed' when absent."
 RIKER / (smiles) You do that very well. So what's the point?
 TROI / He's "used" to us... and we're "used" to him... it's like finding out someone you love has a terminal illness and...
 RIKER / (quickly) Data...
 DATA / (nodding) Counselor. Commander.
 DATA / Would either of you mind if I made a personal inquiry?
 TROI / Personal inquiry? No, go right ahead.
 DATA / I am perceiving an apparent change in the way that others act toward me. For example, people abruptly end their conversations when I appear... as you did when the turbolift doors opened. Is this an accurate observation?
 RIKER / (beat, sighs) Yes.
 TROI / You're right, Data. And it's not a very nice thing to do.
 RIKER / (struggling) It's just that our mental pathways have... become accustomed to your... sensory input patterns...
 DATA / I understand. I am fond of you too, Commander.
 RIKER / We're in orbit.
 PICARD / Any sign of life?
 WORF / Negative.
 DATA / Sir, sensors are picking up unusual temporal disturbances on a small area of the planet's surface... forty-two degrees, seven minutes north by eighty-eight degrees declination east.
 RIKER / (exchanges a glance with Picard) Temporal disturbances...
 PICARD / Take us into a standard orbit above those coordinates...
 DATA / Spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanating from the same location.
 RIKER / Do they correlate with your readings from Earth, Data?
 DATA / Affirmative, sir... the magnetic signature is identical to the one found in the cavern.
 PICARD / Would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids?
 DATA / Only with longterm exposure. There is no immediate threat.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Take an away team.
 RIKER / Worf...
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to La Forge. Meet the away team in transporter room three...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir...
 DATA / Commander...
 PICARD / (interrupting) Mister Data, I'll need you on the bridge to monitor the sensor readings during this investigation...
 DATA / Captain, may I speak to you alone?
 DATA / Sir, it is established procedure that the second officer accompanies the away...
 PICARD / Yes, yes I am aware of that...
 DATA / Then I must assume that this decision is related to the discovery on Earth of...
 PICARD / I see no reason why we shouldn't take reasonable precautions...
 DATA / Captain, no disrespect intended, but there is no rational justification for such a course...
 PICARD / Then, I shall be irrational.
 DATA / It is possible, sir, that the events leading to my death may not begin for years... even centuries.
 PICARD / I hope that's true, Data. Nevertheless, this investigation began with your death... I am simply trying to see that it doesn't end the same way.
 DATA / (beat) While I appreciate your concern, sir, if I may employ an aphorism, one cannot cheat fate.
 PICARD / Cheat fate... ? Perhaps we can't, Mister Data. But, to be honest, I don't think I could forgive myself... if we didn't at least give it a try.
 GEORDI / The concentration of triolic waves falls off about here... (walking into the rockface)) It increases exponentially the closer in we go...
 RIKER / What's the source? Is there something underground?
 GEORDI / Negative, Commander.
 RIKER / Then what's the explanation?
 GEORDI / Don't have one yet. (hits combadge) LaForge to Enterprise.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Run a spectral field correlation for me... see if these triolic readings are directly related to the temporal distortions...
 DATA / Acknowledged.
 RIKER / (concerned) Deanna...
 TROI / There is life here... a child... an old woman... dozens more... dozens... hundreds... terrified...
 RIKER / Terrified... ?
 TROI / My God... they're Human.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Troi's convinced they're human... they may be trapped somehow... we're not sure...
 DATA / Captain, the results of my temporal analysis may be pertinent...
 DATA / It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves...
 GEORDI / That explains a few things. How much, Data?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / A positive displacement of point zero-zero-four percent.
 GEORDI / (off Riker's look) Whatever or whoever's there... is out of phase with us... But we're only talking about a fraction of a second...
 WORF / A fraction of a second would make them invisible?
 GEORDI / A millisecond, a year... it wouldn't make any difference... If what we're reading is accurate, we're occupying the same space... but in a different time...
 RIKER / How do we compensate?
 DATA / Commander, we might be able to manipulate the synchronic distortion...
 GEORDI / (nodding) Maybe. If we created a contained subspace forcefield. But to get a point zero-zero-four variance, we'd need an incredibly sensitive phase discriminator, Data... I don't think we've got one that would come close...
 DATA / Yes, we do. It is built into my positronic decompiler.
 DATA / It would be necessary for me to join the away team, Captain.
 PICARD / (beat) Proceed.
 RIKER / (grim) Mister Data...
 DATA / Sir.
 GEORDI / Let me give you a hand here, Data...
 DATA / (to Riker) Once I have adjusted the forcefield, I will no longer be visible, Commander... however, I have taken steps to ensure that you will still be able to hear me. If you would assist me in a test of the com system...
 DATA / (continuing) My voice will be transmitted on a delay correlated to the phase adjustment... it should allow me to maintain verbal contact...
 RIKER / Will we be able to talk to you?
 DATA / Nossir, that will not be possible.
 GEORDI / You're ready to go...
 GEORDI / Subspace field is established...
 DATA / Adjusting for synchronic distortion... point zero-zero-one...
 DATA / Point zero-zero-two... point zero-zero-three... point zero-zero four...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / I have made visual contact... (beat) There are lifeforms here...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / They are either unaware of me or choosing to ignore me... I am moving approximately ten meters north of my starting position to observe more closely...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / They range from two to three meters in height... silver-gray in color... they have four limbs... no eyes or ears are noticeable... (MORE)
 DATA'S COM VOICE (cont'd) / ... there is a single orifice where a humanoid forehead would ordinarily be. They are reclined against the rockface... surrounding an apparatus of some sort... approximately one-point-five meters in height...
 RIKER / (to Geordi) An apparatus?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / It is releasing what appear to be energy fragments... which are then ingested by the entities through their orifice... perhaps some sort of nourishment...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / The upper portion of the apparatus seems to be a holding facility for the energy segments... there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of these fragments inside. (beat) I have resumed a northern direction... There is no evidence yet of Humans...
 GEORDI / (to himself) Okay, enough, Data... come on back now...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / I have encountered another lifeform... an ophidian... it seems to be restricted by a forcefield...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Two of the silver-gray entities are approaching it... they have released the forcefield...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (breaking up) ...temporal... massive... the ophidian is capable of...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (breaking up) ...Caught... attempting to...
 TROI / Data!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker, report!
 RIKER / (beat) We've lost him.
 DATA / Pardon me. I am searching for two individuals with an ophidian.
 DATA / (continuing) I beg your pardon -- a snake.
 DATA / That is unfortunate.
 DATA / I am sorry but I have no whiskey to give you.
 DATA / I am sorry. But I have no form of legal tender.
 DATA / I would be happy to do so. However, I am presently in need of information.
 DATA / Thank you for the advice, but I am trying to find two individuals with a snake.
 DATA / You require medical attention. I will find a doctor --
 DATA / I require temporary lodging.
 DATA / I understand the source of your misperception. (indicating clothes) But this is not sleepware. And I have no... missus.
 DATA / I am a Frenchman.
 DATA / I have no money.
 DATA / I am capable of performing a significant range of tasks -- both mental and physical. Perhaps your hotel could offer me... a job.
 DATA / Poker?
 DATA / I would like to join your game.
 DATA / (confident) I am a Frenchman.
 DATA / (perfect accent) Alors nous sommes presque freres. Je suis heureux de vous connaitre.
 DATA / In a manner of speaking. It is a crystalline composite of silicon, beryllium...
 DATA / (continuing) Carbon-seventy, and --
 DATA / (nodding) Gold.
 DATA / I accept.
 DATA / To whom are you referring?
 DATA / What was the source of your jocular reaction?
 DATA / (continuing) What was it you found humorous?
 DATA / It was not my intention to deceive.
 DATA / Thank you.
 DATA / (continuing) It has been a pleasure.
 DATA / (continuing) It would be advisable to monitor that cough. I have read that there is currently an epidemic of cholera in San Francisco...
 DATA / Of course. The gratuity.
 DATA / (continuing) Thank you for your assistance.
 DATA / You are welcome.
 DATA / I have no need for companionship. However, I do require some... supplies.
 DATA / I am an inventor...
 DATA / You may retain the surplus for yourself.
 DATA / Exactly.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Close-range sensor analysis has yielded no further trace of Commander Data. Despite the emotional repercussions among my crew, I must move this mission forward.
 RIKER / I'm not willing to accept that he's dead and leave it at that...
 PICARD / Mister Data cannot be our priority...
 RIKER / What's more important than Data?
 TROI / Look at what we have so far... evidence that these aliens have been travelling back in time to Earth...
 BEVERLY / What if they're trying to undermine our history for some reason... ?
 WORF / Some kind of guerilla war...
 PICARD / (nods) We have to operate on the assumption that there is a threat... if not to us then to 19th-century Earth. Our first order of business is to determine what that threat may be. (turns to Geordi) In order to do that, Mister La Forge, we must find a way to communicate with these life-forms...
 GEORDI / It's not going to be easy to reproduce what Data did. We can create a contained subspace field... but we'd need an extraordinarily sensitive phase discriminator to get that point zero-zero-four variance.
 PICARD / Can you build one?
 GEORDI / It won't be as good as Data's...
 RIKER / Will it be good enough?
 GEORDI / I don't know. I can try... it's going to take a while...
 PICARD / I don't want anyone else going in alone.
 GEORDI / I should be able to create a subspace field large enough to encompass everyone. Adjusting the phase inside the field will be the hard part.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 RIKER / There's one thing we have to assume, Captain.
 RIKER / That wherever he is, Data's doing the same thing we are... trying to get to the bottom of this... he may know a lot more about what's going on than we do. It might be in the best interests of this mission to find him...
 PICARD / Perhaps in the course of our investigation we will. I hope so.
 WORF / (sotto, to Riker) If we do find Commander Data, it may be our fate to die with him... in the past. If our remains are in that cavern... they would have turned to dust long ago.
 PICARD (o.s.) / (lightly) I'm afraid to interrupt.
 PICARD / (re: glassware) And let me miss all this? I haven't seen such a complex operation since the Academy lab final in exochemistry.
 PICARD / What did you want to see me about?
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / This is rather unusual... for you to be curious about an away mission...
 PICARD / Guinan, if you have something to tell me, I'm listening.
 PICARD / (agrees) That's general policy...
 PICARD / Why?
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / What do you mean?
 DATA / An apology is not required.
 DATA / I appear to have overexerted myself...
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / (re: money) This is for your trouble.
 DATA / I require a low intensity, magnetic field core. The iron mass of the anvil will provide that.
 DATA / What do you think it is... "gonna be"... ?
 DATA / That is a good guess.
 DATA / (beat) Perhaps.
 DATA / To what are you referring?
 DATA / (concerned at the conclusion) Perhaps I have given you an erroneous impression...
 DATA / You have a ship?
 DATA / That is a considerable spectrum of occupations.
 DATA / I believe your plan is a bit premature.
 DATA / Thank you, Jack.
 DATA / Good afternoon. I would like to speak to Guinan.
 DATA / Data.
 DATA / I do not know...
 DATA / I am a personal friend.
 DATA / It is urgent that I see her...
 DATA / That is an excellent idea. I will wait for them inside.
 DATA / Guinan, I must speak with you immediately.
 DATA / (to Guinan) I am sorry about the disruption, but he did not believe me when I told him we were friends.
 DATA / (puzzled) Data.
 DATA / Yes. We... were on a ship together.
 DATA / The Enterprise.
 DATA / It is a starship.
 DATA / -- I was not sent by your father.
 DATA / Circumstances demand that I take you into my confidence. I require your assistance.
 DATA / (continuing) I am from the future.
 DATA / That is correct. I am from the twenty-fourth century, where you and I serve together on the same starship.
 DATA / Our ship encountered a species who appear to be threatening 19th- century Earth. I investigated, and was inadvertently pulled into their temporal vortex. (beat) When I saw your photograph in the newspaper, I assumed you had joined me from the future. I know your species is long-lived -- but I did not realize you had visited Earth so long ago.
 GEORDI / Here...
 BEVERLY / The triolic waves end... right... here...
 GEORDI / That's fine, Counselor...
 PICARD / How soon will you be ready?
 GEORDI / I think we are, Captain...
 GEORDI / The subspace field is established.
 RIKER / I'd feel more comfortable if you'd monitor us from the ship, captain.
 PICARD / I have reason to believe my presence on this mission is imperative.
 RIKER / Imperative?
 PICARD / Yes. (beat) Mister Worf, you will report to the bridge.
 WORF / Sir... as security officer, my place is by your side.
 PICARD / The security of the Enterprise is of paramount importance, Lieutenant.
 WORF / (beat) Yes, sir. (hits combadge) Worf to Enterprise.
 WORF / (not pleased) Beam me up.
 PICARD / Proceed, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / (for Picard's benefit) I've modified this tricorder to interface with the subspace generator... It should allow me to control the phase discrimination... assuming it's going to work at all... (off Picard's nod) I'll need everyone within the field...
 GEORDI / Adjusting for synchronic distortion... point-zero-zero-one...
 GEORDI / (continuing) ...point-zero-zero-two... point-zero-zero-three...
 PICARD / Why can we see them when they can't see us?
 GEORDI / The phase displacement might not bring us far enough into their perceptual range.
 BEVERLY / (with tricorder) These strands appear to be biomagnetic... variable flux... they must be organic in origin...
 PICARD / A life-form... ?
 TROI / No. There is no life here... what I have sensed is only an imprint, an echo from the last moment of life... Human life... they all died in terror...
 RIKER / My God... they're delivering more of them... for the others to... ingest...
 TROI / (reacts with surprise to something she sees) Will, look at what he's carrying...
 RIKER / The coroner said this room contained all the cholera victims...
 BEVERLY / It doesn't make sense that so many people are dying of cholera -- it just isn't that virulent.
 BEVERLY / Wil... this is strange...
 RIKER / What is it?
 BEVERLY / The cerebral cortex... the cerebellum... the brain stem... the entire nervous system -- has been drained of electrochemical energy. (moving to another body) Here's another one... same neural depletion...
 BEVERLY / These people didn't die of cholera -- they died because their neural energy was drained somehow.
 RIKER / Drained... and taken to Devidia Two... for those aliens to ingest.
 RIKER / If you were a time-traveller with a taste for human neural energy... how would you get your supply?
 BEVERLY / I'd travel back to times when there were plagues and epidemics... when I could murder -- and use disease as a cover.
 BEVERLY / Over half the victims who'd been drained of neural energy came from a place called Sisters of Hope Infirmary.
 RIKER / It's a charity hospital near the waterfront.
 TROI / If the aliens have been killing people there, someone might have noticed something unusual...
 PICARD / If they're moving among humans, they must have taken human form. The question is, how do we know who we're looking for... ?
 RIKER / The tricorder picked up evidence of triolic activity in most of the bodies we looked at. If the aliens are leaving that signature behind, they'll be detectable.
 GEORDI / (thinks for a moment) We might even be able to set up some kind of alien alarm system.
 RIKER / Any luck contacting Data?
 GEORDI / None. The tricorder is broadcasting random emissions... but the range is pretty limited. Almost anything could interfere...
 GEORDI / She's back.
 PICARD / (resigned) Coming, Mrs. Carmichael...
 PICARD / Yes... ?
 PICARD / Ah. The... rent.
 PICARD / Mrs. Carmichael, my troupe is even now in rehearsals for a new production.
 PICARD / It's -- "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
 PICARD / We've performed in London... Paris... Milan... all to sold out houses. I assure you, we'll be able to pay the rent... with a bonus.
 DATA / Why is that?
 DATA / Perhaps you could arrange for us to get in.
 DATA / With permission to dig for the mine shaft.
 DATA / (mildly) I have full confidence in your persuasive abilities.
 DATA / That is strange...
 DATA / I left this device activated... but the transceiver assembly has been removed... without it I will be unable to track the time shifts.
 DATA / Samuel Clemens?
 DATA / If you are correct, he must be told that the device has been modified in such a way that prolonged contact with human tissue would be highly toxic.
 DATA / I am French, not Swiss.
 DATA / I do not believe I know Mister Whitley.
 DATA / I do not know the gentleman by name. I have spoken to several people in that office.
 DATA / As apparently you do, Mister Clemens.
 DATA / In a sense. The time shift is a new gearing system that I have invented... for a horseless carriage.
 BEVERLY / Aren't we going to treat him?
 BEVERLY / Why don't we try an alkaline saline solution... to counteract dehydration?
 BEVERLY / Yes, Doctor.
 TROI / ... did your friend have any visitors before he died?
 PICARD / Hello, Officer. This the Infirmary?
 RIKER / Yes. The entrance is right there.
 PICARD / Replacing the wick screws. City ordinance... makes it safer in case of an earthquake.
 PICARD / That's it for this ward. Have to be moving on.
 BEVERLY / I'm sure I'll manage.
 GEORDI / (pointing) There... by that bed. I can see an afterimage of triolic waves. They were here recently... within the last twenty-four hours.
 BEVERLY / (noting the bed) That's the bed where someone died last night...
 TROI / (pointing to the male patient) This man was complaining about a strange doctor and nurse who visited that patient. (to Geordi) They might still be in the hospital.
 BEVERLY / This will make you more comfortable...
 BEVERLY / Do you need any help, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (stalling) Doctor Apollinaire felt he had entered the algid stage... he was cyanotic, pulse unobservable...
 BEVERLY / That's an interesting cane...
 RIKER / Hold it!
 BEVERLY / Apparently a distraught relative... she became quite upset... we tried to calm her but she ran out.
 RIKER / (as if he's just arrived) How about it? You people see any explosion?
 TROI / There was nothing like that, Officer...
 RIKER / Okay, folks, I suggest you all clear out and let the patients have a little peace... sorry, Doctor.
 RIKER / Just a misunderstanding... I'm clearing these people out of here.
 RIKER / Just got assigned this morning. Usually work downtown.
 RIKER / I want you to know... I have only the greatest respect for the law.
 RIKER / Data!
 GEORDI / Boy, am I glad to see you!
 DATA / I would suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion.
 PICARD / (climbing in) Agreed. Let's get out of here.
 GEORDI / If we tune a phaser to the approximate frequency of triolic waves, and lay down a field burst... it might respond.
 TROI'S VOICE / The ophidian the aliens were carrying...
 RIKER / What the...
 GEORDI / Minute space-time distortions... like the one we saw on Devidia Two...
 RIKER / But they were so small... and they only lasted a second...
 DATA / The aliens seem to have the ability to concentrate the distortion -- and direct it toward a specific time and destination.
 BEVERLY / Maybe they have something... a -- mechanism, that focuses it.
 GEORDI / Any device like that would produce significant levels of triolic waves... (recalling) ... like the ones in the cavern where Data's head was found.
 DATA / I have located that cavern --
 TROI / Mrs. Carmichael... thank goodness you're here.
 DATA_PUCK / How now, spirit! whither wander you?
 BEVERLY_FAIRY / Over hill, over dale, Through bush, through brier, Over park, over pale...
 PICARD / Ah -- just in time! We need someone to read a part...
 RIKER_OBERON / Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
 PICARD / Now, Mrs. Carmichael... (points insistently) Right there...
 RIKER_OBERON / (again) Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
 PICARD / Well, I don't need to hear any more. That was -- truly unique.
 PICARD / I think we've found our Titania... (to the others) ... don't you agree?
 PICARD / You see? We'll begin rehearsals tomorrow.
 DATA / It is all right.
 PICARD / Very well.
 PICARD / Not yet. But you will.
 RIKER / The triolic levels are as high as they were on Devidia Two... (lowers tricorder) ... but no indication of any control mechanism.
 GEORDI / I'm not so sure.
 GEORDI / My VISOR is picking up crystalline fractures. These cavern walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization.
 GEORDI / In fact, if I'm right... this whole cavern has been configured to focus the space-time distortion... just like a lens.
 GEORDI / Captain, we think we're on to something. The cavern itself seems to be acting as a focusing mechanism... and I'm betting the same is true of their habitat back on Devidia Two.
 PICARD / If we can get back there... and destroy that site... can we put an end to their time traveling... ?
 RIKER / We have the ophidian...
 GEORDI / But I don't know if it will work. The energy our phasers generate may not be entirely compatible with the ophidian.
 PICARD / We have no choice but to try.
 PICARD / (to the others) Follow him!
 RIKER / Is everybody all right?
 BEVERLY / I think so...
 RIKER / You--!
 RIKER / It's the twenty-fourth century... this is Devidia Two -- and you shouldn't be here.
 TROI / Your future affairs?
 RIKER / Don't you see -- the disappearance of Mark Twain... one of the most noted literary figures of the nineteenth century...
 RIKER / ... that's not supposed to happen.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Away Team... acknowledge.
 RIKER / We're here, Mister Worf. How long have we been gone?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / You have been off sensor displays for almost nine days, sir.
 RIKER / Stand by to transport five...
 GEORDI / (from a slight distance) Commander...
 RIKER / Mister Worf... six to transport.
 RIKER / The Federation Starship Enterprise. (to transporter chief) Chief, call security. We need an escort for this man.
 RIKER / It's a long story, Mister Worf... I'll brief you later.
 GEORDI / (to Transporter Chief) Have Data's body brought to the Medical Lab. I'm going to try to re-attach the head we have.
 BEVERLY / (skeptical) That head is almost five hundred years old...
 GEORDI / It's the best chance we've got.
 RIKER / (to Worf) I want Mister Clemens here under escort at all times.
 TROI / Commander... perhaps I could handle that. I'd be happy to take Mister Clemens to quarters.
 RIKER / Good idea. (to Clemens) If you would accompany the Counselor...
 PICARD / Don't try to sit up too quickly... you've lost a lot of blood.
 PICARD / I hope they're safely back on the Enterprise by now.
 PICARD / You were hurt. I had to make sure you were all right.
 PICARD / I can't very well let anything happen to you... you're far too important to me.
 PICARD / Believe me, in the future the tables will be turned.
 PICARD / It goes beyond friendship.
 PICARD / No. Because for me, it won't have happened yet.
 PICARD / History fulfilling itself...
 RIKER / You were there, in the cavern. You know what happened. What am I supposed to do?
 RIKER / Damn it, Guinan, don't play games with me... I need answers.
 RIKER / Not telling me might affect my decision, too... did you think of that?
 RIKER / We're talking about Jean-Luc Picard. I'm not going to sit around and hope it all works out... I've got to do something...
 TROI / If you must have one, I'm sure we could replicate it for you.
 TROI / (mildly) I wouldn't know...
 TROI / I think what we've gained outweighs anything that might have been lost...
 TROI / Is that what you see here?
 TROI / Deck thirty-six.
 TROI / He's one of thousands of species we've encountered. We live in a peaceful Federation with many of them... the people you see are here by choice.
 TROI / Poverty was eliminated a long time ago. And a lot of things disappeared with it: hopelessness... despair... cruelty... war...
 TROI / That's right.
 TROI / A long time. The people of your lifetime won't see it.
 TROI / Is it working?
 GEORDI / Not so far. His restart units won't initialize. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / I thought his buffering program would have protected them... but I guess five hundred years was just too long a wait.
 GEORDI / It was found in the cavern... near Data's head. (beat) After five hundred years, I doubt that it'll work either.
 PICARD / Can you communicate?
 PICARD / Are you injured?
 PICARD / You hunt us... you kill us. We cannot allow that.
 PICARD / Perhaps we could find a substitute...
 PICARD / We cannot allow that. (beat) We know how you move back and forth through time... my crew has returned to the twenty-fourth century to destroy your transport site on Devidia Two --
 RIKER / I'm going back for the Captain... Mister Worf, prepare an Away Team to accompany me to the surface. (to Beverly) Doctor, I need to know anything you can tell me about that ophidian.
 BEVERLY / I've just started running some tests. If I could have a few hours...
 RIKER / We can't give the aliens any more time...
 BEVERLY / Wil, I haven't been able to determine if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. The risk would be --
 RIKER / I accept the risk.
 WORF / Sir... permission to speak frankly?
 RIKER / Go ahead.
 WORF / Our priority is to stop the aliens from making any more incursions to Earth. Any delay is unacceptable.
 RIKER / If I can save Captain Picard, I consider it very acceptable.
 WORF / The Captain would not. (beat) I recommend we target photon torpedoes on the alien habitat and destroy it immediately.
 TROI / He's right, Wil.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, power up the photons. Inform me when you're ready.
 GEORDI / Computer... calibrate the power flow polarity selector...
 GEORDI / Computer... initialize the re-load circuits.
 GEORDI / C'mon, Data... this ought to do it...
 GEORDI / Okay, Computer... deactivate the polarity selector. (beat, to himself) I don't get it... why isn't this working?
 GEORDI / Computer, run a diagnostic on the input polarizers.
 GEORDI / Intermittent?
 GEORDI / An iron filing... how did that get in there?
 WORF / Commander, I have set the photons to fire in staggered rounds, detonating in ten-second intervals.
 RIKER / Very well. Fire when ready.
 WORF / The sequence will be ready to initiate in one minute.
 GEORDI / Computer, try another diagnostic on the input polarizers.
 GEORDI / Then that should do it...
 GEORDI / Okay, Data... come on, now...
 DATA / ...torpedoes... don't phasing... aliens...
 DATA / I am processing a binary message that was entered into my static memory by Captain Picard. (beat, still processing) Geordi, are we planning to fire on the alien habitat?
 GEORDI / Yeah, but --
 DATA / It is imperative that we do not. I will explain later.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Riker -- hold your fire!
 DATA / The binary message left by the Captain is not entirely clear. (processing again) He seemed to be concerned about the phase differential of our photon torpedoes... that firing them might produce a catastrophic effect.
 BEVERLY / Then how do we destroy their habitat?
 DATA / If I am correct... we must modify our weapons so that the force of the explosion is re-phased into the aliens' time continuum.
 GEORDI / If we outfit the photons with phase discriminators... we could get the necessary variance.
 RIKER / How long will it take you?
 GEORDI / At least a couple of hours.
 RIKER / Fine. That'll give me time to go get him.
 DATA / Sir?
 RIKER / There's time now... I'm going back to the nineteenth century for the Captain. (to Beverly) Doctor... ?
 BEVERLY / My analysis of the phasers suggests you'd be able to open a rift... but it won't be stable enough to transport more than one person.
 RIKER / You mean... if I go back... only one of us could return.
 BEVERLY / That's right.
 RIKER / There's a risk... we're not certain how stable the rift will be...
 RIKER / Mister La Forge... brief him on what he'll need to do.
 DATA / For what?
 PICARD / Guinan...
 PICARD / I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here...
 PICARD / No. You need help.
 WORF / Sir, Commander La Forge has completed the re-configuration of the photon torpedoes.
 RIKER / If Clemens got back, the Captain should have been here by now.
 WORF / We have no way of knowing if Mister Clemens was successful.
 RIKER / Re-establish your firing pattern, Mister Worf. We'll wait five more minutes.
 WORF / Yes, Commander.
 PICARD / You'll have to get help. Guinan needs medical attention...
 PICARD / (beat) We have a bill at Mrs. Carmichael's boarding house --
 PICARD / Thank you. (beat) I wish time had allowed me to know you better...
 PICARD / I'll see you... in a few minutes.
 DATA / Commander... I am picking up massive triolic wave activity on the surface.
 RIKER / (instantly alert) Is it the Captain?
 DATA / There are no human life signs.
 RIKER / No sign of a temporal distortion?
 DATA / No, sir. But triolic activity is increasing.
 RIKER / (resigned) The aliens...
 RIKER / Mister Worf, are the photons ready?
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / (beat) Fire.
 WORF / Torpedoes away, sir.
 DATA / Commander -- I am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface... and human life signs.
 RIKER / O'Brien -- get him out of there!
 RIKER / Transporter Room -- do you have him?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / He does indeed, Commander. And believe me... it's good to be back.
 WORF / We have destroyed the target, sir. There is no further indication of triolic activity.
 RIKER / Ensign, lay in a course to the nearest Starbase. Warp six.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46001.3.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Everyone who should be in the nineteenth century is safely there, and those who should be in the twenty-fourth are here. Mister Data has been restored to us, head and all... and Samuel Clemens will write the books he was to have written after our encounter.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46041.1. We have located the U.S.S. Yosemite, a Starfleet science vessel sent to the Igo Sector to observe a remote plamsa streamer. The ship has not been heard from in several days.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF and SUPERNUMERARIES at their / stations. There is a sense of urgency in the air.
 PICARD / Magnify.
 RIKER / (to Picard) The last report we have says they were observing the streamer at medium range. Maybe they went in for a closer look... got more than they bargained for.
 PICARD / Hail them.
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / Life signs?
 DATA / Our scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamer's distortion field.
 PICARD / Can we tractor the vessel out?
 DATA / No, sir -- the ionic interference is too heavy.
 RIKER / I'll take a shuttle.
 PICARD / Too risky -- you could be pulled in, too. (to Com) Bridge to Engineering -- Geordi, can we beam an Away Team onto the science ship?
 GEORDI is at his controls, REGINALD BARCLAY a couple / of panels down; other N.D. ENGINEERS are also working.
 GEORDI / We can beam them over there, Captain -- but with all this interference, we might not get a positive lock to bring them back.
 GEORDI / To do that, we'd have to activate the Yosemite's Transporters by remote...
 GEORDI / Good idea, Reg. (to com) Captain, I think we can do it. We're gonna bridge the two Transporter systems.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged. Meet Commander Riker in Transporter Room Three.
 GEORDI / Aye sir. (to Barclay, on the move) Barclay -- I'll need a systems' engineer on this Away Team.
 GEORDI / I meant you, Barclay.
 GEORDI / Dern can handle that. Let's go.
 RIKER / Status, Mister O'Brien?
 RIKER / How much longer?
 RIKER / Let's do it.
 BEVERLY / I'll go next.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Barclay.
 TROI is talking to Barclay, who looks depressed by / recent events. He's moving around the room, picking up objects and setting them down, anything to take the weight off of the moment. Troi tries to reassure him.
 TROI / You were faced with a difficult transport, Reg. Anyone would have been apprehensive in that situation.
 TROI / I'm sure they understand. As soon as you feel up to it, you can probably still join them --
 TROI / Reg... is there something you're not telling me?
 TROI / I see. How long have you had this fear of transporting?
 TROI / Why have you kept it a secret?
 TROI / I doubt that.
 TROI / There's nothing crazy about it, Reg -- you are being taken apart molecule by molecule. You're not the first person to have anxiety about transporting.
 TROI / (continuing) We can desensitize you to this type of fear. It's a slow and gradual process... but it works.
 TROI / Well... the first step might be a relaxation technique. Like Plexing.
 TROI / (nods) It's a Betazoid method. The next time you feel nervous about transporting, you would stimulate a neural pressure point -- like this...
 TROI / There's a nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery -- it stimulates the part of the brain that releases natural endorphins.
 TROI / Reg... there's no need to rush...
 TROI / I suppose I did...
 RIKER / No sign of survivors. No sign of a anyone.
 GEORDI / Maybe they abandoned ship.
 WORF / Unlikely. Both escape pods are still on board.
 GEORDI / Well, there was an explosion in here. We know that much.
 RIKER / Any idea what caused it?
 GEORDI / I've ruled out a reactor core failure... and there's no sign of a systems overload.
 WORF / (off tricorder) Blast analysis indicates the explosion originated...
 WORF / (continuing) ...here. In the center of this transport chamber.
 GEORDI / How is that possible? The Transporter is still functional.
 RIKER / Could someone have beamed an explosive device aboard?
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / (calls out) Commander Riker...
 BEVERLY / (re: crewmember) Lieutenant Joshua Kelly -- he was the ship's engineer.
 RIKER / How did he die?
 BEVERLY / There's evidence of burns... but they don't look serious enough to have killed him... I'm going to have to take him back for an autopsy.
 GEORDI / Welcome aboard, Reg. Ready to work?
 GEORDI / Good. Start by downloading the ship's science logs. Over there...
 RIKER / Still four members of the crew unaccounted for. You come up with anything?
 GEORDI / I don't know how these fit in, but... I found them near the Transporter platform.
 RIKER / What are they?
 GEORDI / They look like pieces of a standard sample container.
 RIKER / Take them back to the ship. We'll analyze them later.
 RIKER / Glad you could join us, Mister Barclay.
 PICARD / Is there any evidence to support this?
 PICARD / I have an Away Team aboard the ship now. Their initial report indicates an explosion on board. But we're not sure if it was from an attack...
 PICARD / A few hours. If it does look like the Cardassians, I'll contact you immediately.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Yes, Mister Data?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / The Away Team is returning to the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. Have Commander Riker join me in my Ready Room as soon as he's on board.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / (taps communicator) La Forge to Transporter Room Three.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / (fritzed) I'm ready to go.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. Our investigation has revealed there was an explosion aboard the Yosemite -- possibly the result of an attack. We are still analyzing data obtained by the Away Team.
 GEORDI / (off monitor) Mission logs... science logs... medical logs -- they're all completely scrambled. It looks like the blast wiped out the ship's core memory.
 GEORDI / (nods) It's worth a try.
 GEORDI / Like what?
 GEORDI / Not really...
 GEORDI / This looks hopeless -- we're not gonna get anything from the logs...
 GEORDI / (re: fragments) Maybe this broken sample container I found can tell us something...
 GEORDI / (re: fragments) Let's try to get this thing back in one piece...
 GEORDI / (confused) Where?
 GEORDI / Sometimes my VISOR picks up resonance patterns from the matter-energy conversion. It's actually kind of pretty. (beat) Why?
 GEORDI / Reg -- what are you getting at?
 GEORDI / Do you think you saw something during transport?
 GEORDI / Something?
 GEORDI / We'd better check it out. When we're done here, let's run a full Transporter diagnostic. Alright?
 GEORDI / The pattern buffer's fine.
 GEORDI / (to Barclay) There's a lot of energy floating around in the beam. Maybe you saw a surge in the matter stream.
 GEORDI / How many Transporter accidents have there been in the last ten years, Reg? Two... three? What about the millions of people who transport every day without a problem?
 GEORDI / Transporting really is the safest way to travel, Reg.
 BEVERLY / I want to take a closer look at those burns. (to Ogawa) Take a tissue sample.
 BEVERLY / Damage to the epidermis only... (beat) Initiate a circulatory probe.
 BEVERLY / His heart is beating.
 BEVERLY / Cardio-stimulator -- now.
 BEVERLY / (astonished) Now the respiratory system's active. What the hell's going on...
 BEVERLY / (off display) Endocrine system's functioning... now the lymphatic system... the pancreas...
 BEVERLY / The autopsy showed residual ionization in every one of Lieutenant Kelly's systems. I think that's what caused the muscular and systemic contractions.
 RIKER / Where did this ionization come from?
 BEVERLY / There's evidence of electrical burns on the victim's body... as if she were exposed to ionized gas... or high energy plasma.
 GEORDI / Plasma? There's no way they could've been exposed... unless it was matter from the streamer...
 PICARD / Is there any evidence of a hull breach... could plasma from the streamer have found its way into the ship?
 GEORDI / No... (gets an idea, to Data) Data, what's the report on that broken sample container?
 DATA / The analysis of the fragments is not yet complete.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) Captain -- if there's evidence of similar ionization in those fragments... it could mean they tried to beam aboard material from the streamer...
 PICARD / (onto the idea) And if the plasma exploded... that would explain a few things. (beat) Let me know when the analysis is complete.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / From the looks of these fracture patterns, I'd say the explosive force came from within the container.
 DATA / The container does show evidence of residual ionization. (beat) I believe your hypothesis was correct. It was being used to store high energy plasma.
 GEORDI / So they were collecting samples from the plasma streamer... (perplexed) But they were using the proper container. How could it have exploded?
 DATA / Perhaps we should try to recreate their experiment to see what happens when matter is beamed aboard under similar conditions.
 GEORDI / Good idea. Let's prepare a new container. (to Barclay) Reg, I don't want to take any chances -- start setting up a level five containment field here in Engineering.
 DATA / Are you having trouble with your eyesight, Mister Barclay?
 DATA / May I have a word with you, Geordi? It concerns Lieutenant Barclay.
 GEORDI / What is it?
 DATA / He appears to be inordinately preoccupied with his physiological condition. I have seen him check his pulse rate, as well as his visual acuity several times in the last twenty minutes.
 GEORDI / Reg...
 GEORDI / Are you alright?
 GEORDI / You look a little pale.
 GEORDI / (gently) It's been a long couple of days, Reg. Why don't you get some rest. We've got everything under control here.
 GEORDI / (taps communicator) La Forge to Counselor Troi.
 TROI'S COM VOICE / Go ahead, Commander.
 GEORDI / Counselor... do you have a minute?
 TROI / Lieutenant Barclay, I've been calling you, why haven't you responded --
 TROI / Reg, what are you doing?
 TROI / I can see that. Where are you going?
 TROI / (seeing through it) Mister Barclay...
 TROI / Commander La Forge said you seemed very nervous this morning.
 TROI / He also mentioned that you said you saw something in the Transporter beam.
 TROI / You don't sound very convinced of that...
 TROI / Mister Barclay, you are exhausted and highly agitated. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / And I cannot allow a member of this crew to endanger himself and others. I think --
 TROI / (cuts him off) I think it's in your best interest to take a leave of absence. (beat) Reg -- I'm temporarily relieving you of duty.
 RIKER / Let me get this straight -- you think it was alive?
 WORF / (dubious) A mouth?
 BEVERLY / I don't see anything wrong with his arm.
 TROI / Reg -- why did you wait so long to tell anybody about your arm?
 GEORDI / We ran a full diagnostic on the Transporter system yesterday, Captain. It checked out fine.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Number One?
 RIKER / We've been conducting intensive scans of the entire binary star system. No sign of any life forms.
 PICARD / Mister Barclay, I understand you've been under a considerable amount of strain the past couple of days. Isn't it possible you simply imagined --
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Commander La Forge, get Chief O'Brien -- take the Transporter system apart piece by piece if you have to. (to Worf) Mister Worf -- maintain a level three security alert until further notice.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) I'll run a micro-cellular scan on Mister Barclay's arm. It'll take some time -- but if there's something wrong, I'll find it.
 PICARD / (satisfied, to all) Keep me apprised. Dismissed.
 BEVERLY / (re: Barclay) I'm reading minute levels of residual ionization in the sub-dermal tissue of his left arm. (beat) The patterns correspond exactly to the ones we measured in Lieutenant Kelly's body... and in the sample container from the science ship. (turns to Barclay) There's no question -- you've been exposed to the same high energy plasma they were.
 BEVERLY / It's too early to draw conclusions... you might've been exposed to something on the science ship. But you did say something touched your left arm during transport... and that's where the ionization is focused...
 RIKER / Does this ionization pose a threat to Mister Barclay?
 BEVERLY / (beat) It might. I'll need to run a base-pair correlation to look for signs of DNA break-down.
 RIKER / Granted. Tell Chief O'Brien to take all primary Transporters off-line. I don't want to risk any further... contaminations. And make sure you take the necessary safety precautions.
 BEVERLY / I want you to wear this monitoring-device. It'll signal me at the slightest sign of increased ionization.
 DATA / (re: container) Structural reinforcement is at two hundred forty percent.
 GEORDI / Activating containment field...
 GEORDI / That should do it. (to Barclay) Okay, Reg -- we've locked onto the coordinates of the plasma streamer. You can beam aboard a sample.
 GEORDI / Okay... what would they have done first?
 DATA / A standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan.
 GEORDI / Sounds like a good place to start. Let's do it.
 DATA / Initiating resonance sweep. Frequency range at --
 GEORDI / Check the containment field.
 GEORDI / My VISOR's picking up bio-magnetic energy... highly complex patterns... (beat) I think these things are alive. Reg...
 GEORDI / Reg?
 GEORDI / Reg!
 DATA / That is correct. They appear to be quasi-energy microbes that exist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer -- which made them undetectable to our sensors.
 GEORDI / They didn't come out until we tried to run the resonance frequency scan. Apparently, they didn't like it too much. They reacted by shattering the sample container.
 GEORDI / Exactly. (beat) We think one or more of the microbes may have gotten into the Transporter system -- and are still caught inside the buffer. It probably explains what you saw in there...
 DATA / Normal spatial relationships, such as size, are often distorted within the matter stream. (MORE)
 BEVERLY / Some of these microbes are also in your body, Reg.
 BEVERLY / They were in Lieutenant Kelly's body as well... that's what caused the contractions during the autopsy.
 BEVERLY / Yes... (off his look) But now that we've identified the microbes, we can start trying to eliminate them. I'm going to run a full spectrum antigen series... if that doesn't work, I'll try an imaging probe...
 GEORDI / (musing) The bio-filter should've screened them out... but it didn't...
 DATA / The microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy. The bio-filters cannot distinguish them from the matter stream.
 GEORDI / Right... but -- if we held Barclay suspended in mid-transport... at the point where matter starts to lose molecular cohesion...
 DATA / The molecules would begin to emit nucleonic particles. We might be able to derive a pattern the computer could recognize...
 GEORDI / ... and reprogram the bio-filters to screen out the microbes. (to Barclay) Reg, I think this'll work.
 GEORDI / We'd have to hold you in there for a while...
 GEORDI / Thirty or forty seconds... it's hard to tell. But I think it would be safe...
 DATA / Your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal would be permanently lost.
 DATA / Your pattern might degrade to the point where your signal would be permanently lost.
 GEORDI / (to Barclay) You ready, Reg?
 GEORDI / Starting bio-filter scan...
 BEVERLY / The imaging scanners still aren't isolating the microbes...
 GEORDI / (concerned) But -- his signal resolution's dropped to fifty-five percent...
 GEORDI / I know, I know... just give me one more second... (beat) We need more dispersion... increase phase-transition frequency...
 BEVERLY / The imaging scanners are actuating...
 GEORDI / Got it... pattern acquisition... (works) Positive.
 GEORDI / (to himself) This won't hurt a bit, Reg...
 GEORDI / (off console) Something's in the beam with him... (taps communicator) Security to Transporter Room Three!
 BEVERLY / (to O'Brien, on the move) Drop the force field.
 GEORDI / (to Barclay) Reg, what happened?
 GEORDI / (to crewmember) It looks like he increased molecular dispersion past the integrity point... your patterns were lost in the beam.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46043.6. The reprogrammed bio-filter was effective in removing the alien microbes from Mister Barclay and the four crewmembers. The microbes have been returned to the plasma streamer.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46071.6. We have been called to the aid of a transport ship, which has been attacked near Rekag-Seronia. Hostilities between the two factions on that planet have intensified recently, threatening an important Federation shipping route.
 PICARD, WORF, DATA, RIKER, TROI, SUPERNUMERARIES as / needed.
 DATA / Captain, sensors have located the transport ship. Two Rekag battle cruisers are flanking it.
 RIKER / Red alert. Shields up.
 WORF / Phasers on line. Photon torpedoes armed and ready.
 PICARD / Is the transport still under attack?
 DATA / The cruisers' weapons are powered up... but...
 DATA / Sir, the Rekag ships are turning and heading out of sensor range.
 RIKER / They don't want to take on the Enterprise...
 DATA / We are within visual range of the transport, Sir.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / Sensors indicate damage to the Dorian's sub space emitters. Audio communication only.
 PICARD / Open a channel, Mister Worf.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / Do you have injuries? Can we assist you in any way?
 PICARD / Of course...
 PICARD / Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead and beam your passengers on board...
 PICARD / Counselor, will you see to our guests' needs and then escort them to my Ready Room.
 TROI / Yes, Captain.
 TROI / I'm Counselor Deanna Troi.
 TROI / Of course. (to Transporter Chief) Chief... (to Alkar) I'll take you to meet Captain Picard...
 PICARD / With all due respect, Admiral -- to put the Ambassador on another unarmed transport will only invite a second assault.
 PICARD / Picard to Riker.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir?
 PICARD / Set a course for Seronia.
 WORF / That is all for today. There will be another class tomorrow at oh-seven-hundred hours.
 TROI / The skills are demanding... You're very disciplined.
 TROI / Yes... Only sometimes I have a problem getting my body to conform to my mind's wishes...
 TROI / I would imagine that your self-discipline helps you in your work...
 TROI / You're going to need all your patience at Seronia... I can't imagine how you'll get the two sides talking to each other...
 TROI / I thought Lumerians were empathic...
 TROI / Curiosity... (off his look) What I sense from you is very unusual. Serenity... calmness... tranquility... you seem to embody the very qualities you hope to draw out in others.
 TROI / Several times... with Captain Picard. There've been instances when having an empath along has been helpful.
 TROI / If the Captain authorizes it, of course I will.
 TROI / What --?
 TROI / I'd better go...
 TROI / Come in.
 RIKER / Hi. It's that time again...
 RIKER / The dreaded crew evaluation reports.
 TROI / Does it have to be today?
 RIKER / It won't get any easier tomorrow.
 TROI / It might...
 RIKER / (concerned) What is it?
 TROI / I've just had a very -- disturbing encounter with Alkar's mother. (beat, as her feelings emerge) Wil, she frightens me. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / The feelings I sense from her are -- malevolent. They're out of proportion -- evil.
 RIKER / I understand she's been ill... and she's very old -- probably senile. (a gentle grin) Listen... we might all end up like that some day.
 TROI / You're right. Okay, let's get through these evaluations. When they're done I'm going to reward myself with two pieces of fudge.
 RIKER / First, molecular biology. Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis...
 RIKER / She's just a bitter old woman... don't give her the power to worry you.
 TROI / You're right. Okay, let's get through these evaluations. When they're done I'm going to reward myself with a chocolate brownie.
 RIKER / Next, Physical Sciences. Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Commander Riker...
 RIKER / Go ahead.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Can you report to Ambassador Alkar's quarters? There's an emergency.
 BEVERLY / (to med tech) Forty cc's inoprovaline.
 RIKER / I'm sorry, Ambassador.
 TROI / Alkar...
 TROI / I'd be glad to help...
 PICARD / I wanted to express my condolences. This must be a difficult time for you.
 PICARD / Do you want to consider postponing your visit to Bironi? I'm sure everyone would understand...
 PICARD / I was only thinking of your best interests...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Mister Worf.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Sensors have picked up a Bironi warship... in a parallel course just inside sensor range.
 PICARD / Yellow alert, Mister Worf.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I must take the necessary precautions. One ship you were on has already been attacked. (beat) And I think you'd agree that a dead man cannot be a particularly effective negotiator.
 TROI / Alkar... come in.
 TROI / An end to grief...
 TROI / An end to pain...
 TROI / Strength comes from love...
 TROI / And courage from wisdom.
 TROI / Computer... today's appointment calendar.
 TROI / Cancel them. Cancel everything until after lunch.
 PICARD / You wanted to see me, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / Yes... I'm sorry to bother you, Captain... but I'm a little concerned.
 BEVERLY / I haven't been able to determine the cause of death.
 PICARD / She was elderly... and Alkar said she had been ill...
 BEVERLY / I found no evidence of disease. (beat) But I did find abnormally high levels of neuro-transmitter residue in her cerebral cortex.
 PICARD / What are you suggesting -- ?
 BEVERLY / I don't know. I'd like to do an autopsy... but I've already spoken to Alkar. He tells me that Lumerian custom forbids it. (beat) Could you talk to him?
 PICARD / Do you have any reason to suspect her death poses some kind of threat to the Enterprise?
 BEVERLY / ... Well, no.
 PICARD / Then I can't see any alternative but to comply with his wishes.
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / He tells me that Lumerian custom forbids autopsy except in cases where contagious disease might be involved. (beat) Could you talk to him?
 PICARD / We're in the middle of a delicate situation. I'd prefer not to go to him with this unless you feel it's absolutely necessary.
 BEVERLY / (understanding) I might be able to find other ways to investigate. I'll try those first.
 TROI / Hello...
 TROI / I thought you might like some company. Unless you're busy...
 TROI / No.
 TROI / I'd like you to talk to me.
 TROI / About you. I don't know anything about you. And... I'd like to.
 TROI / What kind of woman do you find attractive?
 TROI / Do you find me attractive?
 TROI / And... when you're attracted to someone... what do you usually do... ?
 TROI / Is it really so complicated?
 TROI / Perhaps you overthink things...
 TROI / I'm here...
 TROI / (surprised to see him) Wil...
 RIKER / We were going to finish the crew evaluation reports...
 TROI / Of course, come in.
 RIKER / (bemused) As you were.
 TROI / If there's anything else I need... I know where to find you.
 TROI / Are you bothered by his being here?
 RIKER / Of course not.
 TROI / Good. Because it's really none of your business.
 RIKER / I know that...
 RIKER / We were still with Lieutenant Fratis in molecular biology...
 TROI / Why do I think you're upset?
 RIKER / I don't know. Could we just go over these evaluations?
 TROI / Wil, remember who you're talking to... you are bothered, I can tell...
 RIKER / (getting annoyed) Look, Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded. When you're ready to work, why don't you let me know?
 TROI / I will.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46073.6. We have arrived without incident at Seronia, where two members of Ambassador Alkar's delegation have been waiting. They have joined us to report on the situation in the capital city.
 PICARD / I was under the impression there was a cease fire agreement.
 PICARD / Ambassador... the situation sounds volatile. Perhaps a cooling off period --
 PICARD / Then I recommend asking both sides if they will agree to meet at the coastal city of Darthen.
 PICARD / It has been neutral throughout the conflict. Both Seronians and Rekag loyalists live there. It might be acceptable as a compromise.
 PICARD / (beat) Very well.
 TROI / Why do you think that?
 TROI / Give me an example of what you mean.
 TROI / Do you know of any reason why he might do that?
 TROI / Maybe he's tired of hearing you complain.
 TROI / I'm certainly tired of it. How do you think it feels to sit and listen to someone whine about themselves all the time?
 TROI / This isn't Starfleet Academy. You aren't going to be coddled. If you can't take it here, you might think about a transport ship. There's a lot less pressure there.
 TROI / (softly) But if you aren't up to it... you don't deserve to be here. Isn't that right?
 TROI / Then you'd better get hold of yourself. Or be prepared for a transfer.
 TROI / Glad I could help.
 GEORDI / Here we go... Bio-filter log on Sev Maylor...
 BEVERLY / Geordi, could this log have been damaged in any way... ?
 GEORDI / I doubt it. Why do you ask?
 BEVERLY / There's a discrepancy between the log... and the tricorder readings I took just three days later.
 BEVERLY / The tricorder shows massive physiological deterioration compared to her condition when she beamed aboard. It's hard to believe so much damage could have occurred in such a short time.
 GEORDI / Well... I could run a diagnostic of the bio-filter system. And your tricorder.
 BEVERLY / Thanks. But the best way to get the information I need would be to do an autopsy.
 RIKER / Ambassador, we've received word from the Seronian and the Rekag leaders. Both sides have agreed to meet with you in Darthen tomorrow.
 DATA / (puzzled) Counselor Troi has altered her appearance...
 RIKER / (likewise) She certainly has...
 TROI / Am I interrupting?
 TROI / You want him... I can tell. But you have nothing to give him...
 TROI / And you're envious of him... you pretend to support him, but secretly you want him to fail...
 TROI / (louder) I won't -- I want to be here, with you --
 RIKER / Excuse me, Ambassador. The Counselor and I are needed on the Bridge.
 RIKER / (low) I don't know what you thought you were doing in there, but you were way out of line...
 RIKER / All right, Deanna... just what the hell is going on?
 TROI / Imzadi... do you still care about me?
 RIKER / Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you... (gesturing to her attire) What is all this?
 TROI / Don't you think I'm attractive?
 RIKER / This just isn't... you.
 TROI / But it is. (arms around his neck) You want me, don't you?
 RIKER / Deanna...
 TROI / I need you...
 RIKER / (shocked) Hey -- what is this?
 TROI / Please...
 TROI / Come in...
 TROI / You said you'd take me with you...
 TROI / You told me I'd be helpful... you needed me...
 TROI / (more agitated) Then take me -- don't leave me here...
 TROI / Tell me... is Liva going with you?
 TROI / She wants to take you away from me...
 TROI / I won't let her have you... I'll stop her...
 TROI / I will go with you... don't leave me... please... Alkar... take me with you... don't do this...
 RIKER / You wouldn't have recognized her. Her dress... her hair... everything about her was...
 RIKER / I'm closer to Deanna than anyone I've ever known... (beat) But last night she was someone I'd never seen before.
 BEVERLY / Do you know of anything that might have caused her to act like that?
 RIKER / No. I've thought and thought about it. I don't have an answer.
 BEVERLY / Computer... location for Counselor Troi.
 PICARD / Ambassador, we've just gotten word that the Rekags and Seronians are in disagreement about the seating arrangement at the conference table.
 PICARD / The good news, however, is that the cease fire seems to be holding.
 PICARD / Chief --
 TROI / (to Alkar) Will you take me with you?
 PICARD / Deanna... ?
 TROI / (still focused on Alkar) I won't let her have you --
 PICARD / Security to Transporter Room Two.
 TROI / No... let go...
 BEVERLY / It's just a superficial wound.
 PICARD / What's happened to Deanna... ?
 BEVERLY / I don't know... every system in her body has elevated readings... (to Security Guards) Take her to Sickbay.
 PICARD / No... I think you must proceed with your mission.
 PICARD / (to Transporter Chief) Chief, transport them to the surface.
 BEVERLY / Captain... I want you in Sickbay, too.
 BEVERLY / (to Ogawa) We'll have to sedate her. Give her twenty cc's of melorazine.
 BEVERLY / How's it feeling?
 PICARD / A little stiff, but otherwise fine.
 BEVERLY / That'll disappear in a day or two.
 BEVERLY / If you remember, I found abnormally high levels of neuro-transmitter residue in Alkar's mother.
 PICARD / Could Deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her?
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure. (beat) I need to do an autopsy. (off Picard's look) I don't care what the customs of Alkar's people are. I need to find out if there's a connection between what killed her and what's happening to Troi.
 PICARD / Picard to Lieutenant Worf...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf here, Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, contact the Alliance conference on Seronia. I need to speak with Ambassador Alkar.
 WORF'S VOICE / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / (to Doctor) Her brain TECH readings show neural transmitter production continues to rise.
 WORF'S VOICE / Captain, Ambassador Alkar is at the negotiation table and cannot be disturbed.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Let me know the moment he is available.
 PICARD / Proceed with the Autopsy. (then; softer) Let me know as soon as you have something.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Medical Log, Stardate 46075.1. I have performed an autopsy on Alkar's mother. But instead of answering our questions, the results have created an even deeper mystery.
 BEVERLY / I don't have any explanation for this, Captain... but when I examined Maylor's body... I found that her heart, her lungs, her skeletal structure... most of the systems in her body... were those of a thirty-year-old.
 PICARD / How could that be? We both saw the woman.
 BEVERLY / And that's not all. I compared Maylor and Alkar's DNA. I don't know who that woman was -- but she was definitely not his mother.
 BEVERLY / Deanna's condition is deteriorating rapidly. She could die. There are questions that only Alkar can answer.
 PICARD / Picard to Lieutenant Worf...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Here, sir.
 PICARD / Meet me in Transporter Room Two. We're going to the surface.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / And she wasn't ninety-three years old.
 PICARD / Yes, and for very good reason. Deanna Troi is in Sickbay dying. Doctor Crusher doesn't know the cause of her condition. (beat) But I believe you do.
 PICARD / I'm not particularly interested in your techniques as a mediator --
 PICARD / Is this... what you've done to Counselor Troi?
 PICARD / Then... you deliberately began using Deanna...
 PICARD / Receptacles... ?
 PICARD / No, Alkar... you can't explain away a wantonly immoral act just because you think it's connected to some higher purpose.
 PICARD / And you think that justifies brutalizing her? And the others you've used?
 PICARD / If you think you appear courageous, you're mistaken. You're a coward. You exploit the innocent so you don't have to shoulder the burden of unpleasant emotions.
 PICARD / This time you will be held accountable. I'm taking you back to the Enterprise to release Counselor Troi.
 PICARD / Lock on to Alkar's signal and bring him aboard.
 WORF / Sir, I am sure the Seronians have reactivated their security field.
 PICARD / Then work with Mister La Forge to find a way to break through it. (beat) I want that man on this ship.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I'll be in Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / If Alkar is flooding her with this... psychic waste... that would explain the high level of neuro-transmitters. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / All the negative emotions pouring into her have caused an abnormal chemical response in her brain...
 RIKER / Isn't there something you can do to counteract it?
 BEVERLY / Enzymic decontaminants will reduce the level of the neuro-transmitters -- but I can't make any headway unless Alkar stops what he's doing.
 PICARD / He has no intention of stopping. He feels perfectly justified in using her until she dies.
 BEVERLY / Then Deanna has to die.
 BEVERLY / The only way to save her is to break the link with Alkar. And that will only happen if she's no longer an adequate receptacle.
 BEVERLY / When Maylor died, Alkar immediately turned to Deanna.
 PICARD / If he thinks Deanna is dead... he'll break the link and turn to someone else -- probably one of his delegation.
 RIKER / Wait a minute... you're talking about... about killing Deanna...
 BEVERLY / I'll be able to resuscitate her, Wil... as long as it's not more than thirty minutes... the question is -- will that be enough time? Unless he establishes a link with someone else before we revive Deanna he might turn back to her.
 PICARD / We must also keep in mind that we're putting his next victim at risk... I'll want every possible security measure taken to protect that person.
 RIKER / (to Beverly) How... will you...
 BEVERLY / I'll give her a hypospray of dylamadon. (beat) It's the most gentle way...
 PICARD / Proceed, Doctor.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar. Respond, sir.
 PICARD / You must return to the Enterprise immediately. Counselor Troi is dying. (beat) We are prepared to transport you from the surface whether you come willingly or not.
 PICARD / They won't protect you any longer. Transporter Room Two, prepare to energize --
 BEVERLY / Computer, note in the log that death occurred at fourteen thirty hours... due to respiratory and renal failure.
 PICARD / I intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done.
 RIKER / How much longer do we have?
 BEVERLY / Three minutes, forty seconds...
 PICARD / Picard to Transporter Room Two... lock on to the young woman in Ambassador Alkar's quarters... stand by to transport her out of there.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, station yourself outside the quarters.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / We have a minute and a half left... (to Ogawa) Prepare a hypospray of cordrazine.
 BEVERLY / We'll use that in conjunction with the cortical stimulator...
 BEVERLY / We can't wait any longer. (to Ogawa) Release the stasis field. Ten cc's of cordrazine.
 BEVERLY / Cortical stimulator...
 BEVERLY / Now.
 BEVERLY / Again.
 BEVERLY / All right... let's neutralize the neuro-transmitters. Initiate the decontamination sequence...
 PICARD / Picard to Transporter Room Three...
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) Not yet. I won't know for certain that it's working until we get her below three hundred percent.
 PICARD / (touches communicator) Picard to Transporter Room Three. Energize.
 WORF / (touches communicator) Worf to Captain Picard. Ambassador Alkar is dead.
 TROI / Wil...
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher thinks he must have been at a susceptible point in the meditation ceremony... when he was somehow vulnerable.
 TROI / Then the flow of negative emotions and feelings was reversed somehow -- and went back to him.
 RIKER / That's our guess. And like a man with no immune system... he just couldn't handle the sudden overload...
 TROI / And... Liva?
 RIKER / She seems to be fine. He never got to the point where he could establish a link with her.
 TROI / When I think back on the last few days... it's as though I'm looking at a Holodeck projection... of someone else.
 RIKER / (gentle smile) That's kind of how it seemed to the rest of us...
 TROI / Thanks for sticking by me.
 RIKER / I always will. (wry) Even when you're old and grey.
 DATA is working at the aft science station. PICARD and / RIKER are standing nearby, WORF is at Tactical, and / ENSIGN RAGER is at Con. The monitor at the science station shows an Okudagram of a subspace radio wave.
 DATA / (working) I have identified the signal, Captain. It is from the U.S.S. Jenolan, a Federation transport ship reported missing in this sector seventy-five years ago.
 RIKER / Code one alpha zero. Ship in distress.
 PICARD / (to Rager) Bring us out of warp, Ensign. All stop.
 PICARD / Report.
 WORF / We have entered a massive gravitational field.
 DATA / (works) There are no stars or other stellar bodies listed on our navigational charts. However, sensors indicate the presence of an extremely strong gravitational source in this vicinity.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Can you localize the source of the gravity field?
 RIKER / Sensors?
 DATA / I am having difficulty scanning the object. However, it would appear to be approximately two hundred million kilometers in diameter.
 RIKER / That's nearly the size of Earth's orbit around the sun.
 PICARD / Why didn't we detect it before now?
 DATA / The object's enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetric interference. That might have prevented our sensors from detecting the object before we dropped out of warp.
 PICARD / Mister Data, could this be a... Dyson Sphere?
 DATA / (thinks) This object does fit the general parameters of Dyson's theory.
 RIKER / A Dyson Sphere?
 DATA / (thinks) There is no comparative data, Captain. However, this object does fit the general parameters of Dyson's theory.
 RIKER / A Dyson Sphere?
 PICARD / It's a very old theory, Number One. I'm not surprised you haven't heard of it. A twentieth century physicist, Freeman Dyson, postulated that an enormous hollow sphere could be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage of harnessing all the radiant energy of the star. A population living on the interior surface would therefore have a virtually inexhaustible source of power.
 RIKER / Are you saying there might be people living in there?
 DATA / Possibly a great number of people, Commander. The interior surface area of a sphere this size would be equivalent to more than two hundred fifty million class M planets.
 WORF / Sir. I have located the distress signal. It is coming from a point on the northern hemisphere.
 PICARD / Ensign Rager, take us into synchronous orbit above that position.
 DATA / (off console) I have found the Jenolan, Captain. It has impacted on the surface of the sphere. (works) There are no life signs. However, there are several small power emanations... and life support is still functioning at minimal levels.
 RIKER / (to com) Bridge to Engineering. Geordi, meet me in Transporter Room Three. (to Worf, on the move) Mister Worf.
 RIKER / (reacts to smell) The air's pretty stale.
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) Life support is barely operating.
 RIKER / (to Worf) See if you can increase the oxygen level.
 GEORDI / Commander.
 GEORDI / The Transporter is still on-line... it's being fed power from the auxiliary systems.
 RIKER / (off console) The rematerialization subroutine has been disabled.
 GEORDI / That's not all... the phase inducers are connected to the emitter array... the override is completely gone... and the pattern buffer's been locked into a continuous diagnostic cycle.
 RIKER / This doesn't make any sense... locking the unit in a diagnostic mode just sends inert matter through the pattern buffer. Why would anyone want to --
 GEORDI / There's a pattern still in the buffer.
 RIKER / (shocked, off console) It's completely intact... less than point zero zero three percent signal degradation. How is that possible?
 GEORDI / I don't know... but I've never seen a transporter system jury-rigged like this.
 RIKER / Could someone... survive in a Transporter buffer for seventy-five years?
 GEORDI / I know a way to find out.
 GEORDI / Someone else's pattern is still in the buffer?
 RIKER / I'm sorry.
 RIKER / I'm Commander William Riker from the starship Enterprise.
 RIKER / Well...
 WORF'S VOICE / Sir.
 WORF / (continuing, to Riker) I have restored life support. The oxygen levels will return to normal shortly.
 RIKER / (introducing) Captain Scott... Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / (simply) Yes.
 RIKER / (gently) Captain Scott... perhaps there are a few things we should talk about.
 RIKER / (on the move toward the door) We should probably get you to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher will be able to...
 RIKER / (quiet) Geordi, I think our guest is going to have a lot of engineering questions...
 GEORDI / (grins) I'll take care of him, sir.
 GEORDI / Those were replaced with isolinear chips about forty years ago. It's a lot more efficient now.
 GEORDI / Uh... be careful there. That's an EPS power tap.
 GEORDI / (on the move) You were saying earlier that you were on your way to the Norpin Colony when you had a warp engine failure...
 GEORDI / Yeah. Uh, big as life... the Dyson Sphere, right?
 GEORDI / I know... it's pretty amazing. What happened when you first approached it?
 GEORDI / What made you think of using the Transporter pattern buffer to stay alive?
 GEORDI / But locking it into a diagnostic cycle to keep the signal from degrading... and cross connecting the phase inducers to provide a regenerative power source... it's brilliant.
 GEORDI / I think you're going to like the twenty-fourth century, Mister Scott. We've made some pretty incredible advances in the last eighty years.
 GEORDI / Wait until you see the Holodeck.
 BEVERLY / You've had a hairline fracture of the humerus. (shuts off device) It'll ache for a few days, but it should be fine.
 PICARD / I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Captain Scott.
 PICARD / How are you feeling?
 BEVERLY / (she closes tricorder) Other than a couple of bumps and bruises, I'd say you feel fine for a man of a hundred and forty-seven.
 PICARD / I must say I was more than a little surprised when Commander Riker informed me you were aboard the Jenolan. Our records didn't list you as one of their crew.
 PICARD / I see. Well, I would very much enjoy the opportunity to discuss your career at some point. History is one of my hobbies and I'm sure you have some fascinating insights into the events of your time.
 PICARD / Good. I look forward to it. (to Geordi) Commander, we need to begin a full spectrographic analysis of the Dyson Sphere.
 GEORDI / I'll get right on it, sir.
 PICARD / (to Scott) Again, welcome aboard, Captain.
 GEORDI / (to Scott) I have to get back to Engineering to start that analysis.
 BEVERLY / Captain... The first thing you're going to do is get some rest. You've had quite a shock to your system and I don't want you to push yourself too hard.
 GEORDI / We're pretty busy right now, anyway, Captain Scott. But I'd be happy to give you a tour of Engineering a little later, when the doctor says it's okay.
 BEVERLY / (smiles at Scott) I'll have someone show you to your quarters.
 GEORDI / (to Bartel) I want you to shut down the warp engines and recalibrate the aft sensors while I work on the lateral array.
 GEORDI / I'll handle it, Bartel.
 GEORDI / Captain Scott, this... really isn't a good time --
 GEORDI / Scotty... this really isn't a good time for a tour. We're running a phase seven survey of the Dyson Sphere.
 GEORDI / That's... very kind. But I think we can handle it...
 DATA / Sensor readings indicate the presence of a G-type star at the center of the sphere. There also appears to be a class-M atmosphere clinging to the interior surface.
 PICARD / Is there any indication that the sphere is inhabited?
 DATA / Not as yet, sir. Our preliminary data indicates it is still capable of supporting life, but we have been unable to find definite signs of current habitation.
 PICARD / Send out a series of class four probes to survey the far side of the sphere. Perhaps we'll have more luck with them.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / (to N.D. Engineer) Adjust the frequency stabilization on the main deflector dish. It's out of synch with the aft sensors.
 GEORDI / (distracted) What?
 GEORDI / We use a multi-phase auto-containment field now... it's meant to operate above three percent.
 GEORDI / Thank you.
 GEORDI / (to Engineer) Huh? Oh, thanks.
 GEORDI / (shutting the drawer) We recomposite the crystals while they're still inside the articulation frame. I'd like to explain everything, but the Captain wants this spectrographic-analysis done by thirteen hundred hours.
 GEORDI / I told him I'd have that analysis done in an hour.
 GEORDI / (puzzled) An hour.
 GEORDI / (irritated) Of course I did.
 GEORDI / Look, sir. I've tried to be patient, I've tried to be polite. But I've got a job to do here. And you're... in the way.
 TROI ENTERS. Her demeanor is so pleasant and innocent / that Scott feels compelled to back away from his anger a little.
 TROI / Is this a bad time?
 TROI / Deanna Troi, ship's counselor... and actually I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
 TROI / I'm glad you're comfortable. (beat) But I was actually more interested in how you feel.
 TROI / Yes. It would be perfectly normal to feel disoriented, confused or even frightened following the kind of extraordinary experience you've just had.
 TROI / I'm sure you have a lot of questions about what's happened over the last seventy-five years... if you'd like, I could help you access some of our historical records... maybe you could discover what happened to your family... or friends.
 TROI / I'm here to take care of the emotional well-being of our crew. (beat, then with smile) And of our guests.
 TROI / Yes. They started assigning Counselors to starships about forty years ago when they realized that the pressures of extended space travel --
 TROI / Among other things.
 TROI / Geordi didn't send me and I know you're not crazy.
 DATA / (to Waiter) I believe I may be of some assistance. Captain Scott is unaware of the existence of synthehol.
 DATA / Yes. It is an alcohol substitute which is now normally served aboard starships. It simulates the appearance, smell, and taste of alcohol, but the intoxicating affects can be easily dismissed.
 DATA / No, sir. I am an android. My name is Commander Data.
 DATA / I believe Guinan does keep a limited supply of non-syntheholic products. Perhaps one of them would be to your liking.
 DATA / It is green.
 PICARD / I hope I'm not interrupting, but I was just coming off duty and wanted to see how you were doing.
 PICARD / Aldeberan whiskey. (off Scott's look of surprise) Who do you think gave it to Guinan?
 PICARD / Constitution class...
 PICARD / There's one at the fleet museum. This is your Enterprise?
 PICARD / The first ship I ever served aboard as Captain was called the Stargazer... it was an overworked, underpowered vessel that was always on the verge of flying apart at the seams. In every measurable way, my Enterprise is a superior ship. (beat) And yet... there are times I miss that cramped little Bridge very much.
 PICARD / What do you think of the Enterprise-D?
 PICARD / But... ?
 PICARD / Seventy-five years is a long time. If you'd like to study some of the technical --
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, I understand that the Jenolen conducted an extensive survey of the Dyson sphere before it crashed. Have we been able to access those records?
 GEORDI / We tried to download their memory core, but it was pretty heavily damaged in the crash. We haven't been able to get much out of it.
 PICARD / Perhaps Captain Scott could be of use in accessing that material.
 GEORDI / It's possible. He would know those systems better than any of us. I'll have Lieutenant Bartel beam down with him.
 PICARD / Commander. I'd like you to accompany Mister Scott.
 GEORDI / Me, sir?
 PICARD / This is not an order, Geordi, it is a request... one which you are free to decline. (beat) One of the most important things in a man's life is the need to feel useful. Mister Scott is a Starfleet officer... I would like him to feel useful again.
 GEORDI / I'll go with him, Captain.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 DATA / Commander, I believe I have found something on the sphere which could be a communications device.
 DATA / There is an antenna array approximately four hundred thousand kilometers south of our present position. It is emitting low-intensity subspace signals.
 RIKER / Can we open a channel?
 DATA / Not from our present orbit, Commander. The array is currently directed away from us.
 RIKER / (to Rager, indicating Data's console) Prepare to take us to an orbit above those coordinates. (to com) Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.
 GEORDI / Are you feeling all right?
 GEORDI / Okay.
 GEORDI / (to Transporter Technician) Energize.
 DATA / Sensors indicate that the large circle is a portal or airlock, possibly leading to the interior of the sphere.
 PICARD / You said you found a communications array?
 DATA / Yes, sir. It is located on the periphery of the hatch.
 RIKER / This looks like the front door... should we ring the bell?
 PICARD / Mister Worf, open a channel to that array.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 DATA / (off console) Some type of tractor beam has locked onto us.
 RIKER / Helm, get us out of here!
 WORF / (looking at viewer) We are being pulled inside.
 DATA / (working) The resonance frequency of the tractor beams is incompatible with our power systems. Warp and impulse engine relays have been overloaded. I am attempting to compensate.
 RIKER / (to Rager) Hold position here until we can get our bearings.
 PICARD / Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. Where are we?
 DATA / We are approximately ninety million kilometers from the star's photosphere. (beat) I am reading a great deal of surface instability. It may be--
 GEORDI / Okay... I've got three access lines to the central core... still nothing.
 GEORDI / What?
 GEORDI / I don't know... looks like some of it has held together pretty well.
 GEORDI / That's interesting... because I was just thinking that a lot of these systems haven't changed much in seventy-five years.
 GEORDI / This Transporter is almost identical to the ones we use on the Enterprise. (gestures to other consoles) The subspace radio and sensors operate on the same basic principles, and impulse engine design hasn't changed much in two hundred years. If it weren't for the structural damage, this ship could still be in service today.
 GEORDI / I don't know... if this ship were operational I bet it would run circles around the Enterprise at impulse speeds. (beat) Just because something's old doesn't mean you throw it away.
 GEORDI / (thinks) I haven't seen one of those in a long time... but I might have something similar. (hits combadge) La Forge to Enterprise. (beat) La Forge to Enterprise, come in please.
 GEORDI / (works) No... (beat) They're gone.
 DATA / We will enter the sun's photosphere in three minutes.
 PICARD / Maneuvering thrusters?
 RIKER / I've got thirty percent power... it won't be enough to stop us.
 PICARD / No. But it may be enough to turn us into orbit and hold our distance from the photosphere.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Port thrusters ahead full, starboard back full.
 DATA / (off console) Our flight path is changing... right ten point seven degrees... insufficient to clear the photosphere.
 RIKER / (to com) Lieutenant Bartel, divert all power from auxiliary relay systems to the maneuvering thrusters.
 DATA / Our angular deflection is increasing. Now at fifteen degrees... eighteen... turn now twenty point one degrees.
 RIKER / (to Picard) I'll see about getting main power back on-line.
 PICARD / Very well.
 PICARD / Mister Data, begin a scan of the interior surface for life forms. I want to know who brought us in here and why.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / I can't find them anywhere in orbit.
 GEORDI / No, we'd be picking up background radiation if they'd gone down.
 GEORDI / Maybe. (beat) Whatever's happened, we've got to find them. If we can get these engines back on-line, we could track them by their impulse ion trail.
 DATA / The sphere appears to be abandoned.
 DATA / Our sensors show that the star is extremely unstable. It is experiencing severe bursts of radiation and matter expulsions.
 PICARD / That would explain why they abandoned it. (beat) But if there's no one still living here, how were we brought inside?
 DATA / I believe we triggered a series of automatic piloting beams which were designed to guide ships into the sphere.
 WORF / (urgent) Sir. Sensors show a large magnetic disturbance on the star's surface.
 DATA / It is a solar flare, Captain. Magnitude: twelve. Class: B.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Shields?
 WORF / Shields are up... but only at twenty-three percent.
 DATA / The star has entered a period of increased activity. Our sensors indicate that solar flares will continue to grow. In three hours, our shields will no longer be be sufficient to protect us.
 GEORDI'S VOICE / The tank can't handle that much pressure.
 GEORDI / It's in the impulse engine specifications.
 GEORDI / Right.
 GEORDI / You were right... the auxiliary tank is holding.
 GEORDI / Hey, you're the senior officer here.
 GEORDI / All right.
 WORF / Shields still holding... but down another fifteen percent.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain.
 PICARD / Go ahead Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We've restored helm control... and you have partial impulse power.
 PICARD / Good. Stand-by. (to Worf) Can we use the phasers to open a hole in the sphere?
 WORF / No, sir. The exterior shell is composed of carbon-neutronium. Our weapons would be ineffective.
 PICARD / Mister Data, we need to find a way out of here. Begin scanning for another hatch or portal that might still be open.
 DATA / The interior surface area is over ten to the sixteenth square kilometers. It will take seven hours to completely scan the surface.
 DATA / I will endeavor to speed up the process.
 GEORDI / It looks like some kind of doorway.
 GEORDI / No bet here. The question is, how?
 GEORDI / So they didn't go in willingly.
 GEORDI / This looks like some kind of communications array.
 GEORDI / Did you try hailing them?
 GEORDI / (thoughtfully) Hailing is standard procedure today, too...
 GEORDI / Scotty, what if these aren't communications arrays... what if they're access terminals... which are triggered by subspace signals on certain frequencies...
 GEORDI / Exactly. When the Enterprise saw this terminal they probably did the same thing you did seventy-five years ago -- opened a channel. Only this time it triggered something which activated that hatch and pulled the ship inside the sphere.
 GEORDI / We could trigger the hatch, but we'd probably be pulled in like they were.
 GEORDI / You can't be serious. That hatch is huge. It could crush this ship like an egg.
 GEORDI / (firm) Scotty. This is crazy. I am not going to let you---
 GEORDI / All right. Let's do it.
 GEORDI / We're at five hundred thousand kilometers.
 GEORDI / Okay. Here we go.
 GEORDI / Come on... there's nothing out here... give it up. (works) I still can't open a channel to the Enterprise... there's too much interference. We'll have to to wait until we're right in the doorway.
 GEORDI / (off monitor) That's it. Let's go! Full impulse.
 WORF / (off console) Sir. There is an audio message from Commander La Forge.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / (static) This is La Forge, do you read me, Enterprise?
 PICARD / (to com) We read you, go ahead Commander.
 PICARD / Understood. (urgent, to Rager) Set a course.
 GEORDI / (working console) I've lost helm control... (to com) La Forge to Enterprise. Captain, we won't be able to move this ship out of the way when you get here... you're going to have to destroy it in order to escape.
 PICARD / (to Data) How long will it take us to reach them?
 DATA / With impulse engines operating at sixty percent power, it will take one minute forty seconds.
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge to Transporter Room Three. Stand by to beam two from the Jenolen as soon as we're in range.
 WORF / Photon torpedoes loaded.
 DATA / We are within transporter range.
 PICARD / (quickly) Bridge to Transporter Room. Energize. (a quick beat, then to Worf) Fire torpedoes.
 GEORDI / So, this alien space 'baby'-- which was about the size of a four-story building -- really thought the Enterprise was its mother.
 GEORDI / No, really. It was 'suckling' power directly from the ship's fusion reactors... so Doctor Brahms and I changed the power frequency from twenty-one centimeters to point-oh-two centimeters...
 GEORDI / That's right.
 GEORDI / (smiles) I have a better idea.
 PICARD / Call it... an extended loan. Since you lost your ship while saving ours, it seemed only fair.
 RIKER / (re: shuttle) It's not much to look at...
 GEORDI / It's a little slow, but it'll get you to the Norpin colony... if that's really where you want to go.
 PICARD / (holds out hand) Bon voyage, Mister Scott.
 GEORDI / Yeah.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46154.2. The Enterprise has entered the Amargosa Diaspora, an unusually dense globular cluster. We are faced with the daunting task of charting this vast region.
 RIKER is lying in bed, just starting to wake up. He / lies there a moment, groggy, staring into middle distance... then finally sits up. Every move is a struggle. He swings his legs over the bed... rubs his hands over his face... yawns... he just can't get going...
 GEORDI and DATA are working at a console; LIEUTENANT / SHIPLEY and VARIOUS ND'S also present. A console monitor displays a MAP of the AMARGOSA DIASPORA.
 GEORDI / (re: map) Lieutenant Shipley -- let's get a triangulation on these sector points... (TECH)
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Sorry I'm late... I overslept again... (beat) What have you got?
 GEORDI / The cluster's a lot more dense than we thought. It's going to take three days just to map one tenth of it.
 RIKER / Three days?
 GEORDI / I think we've found a way to speed this up. We've been testing a method of channeling warp energy to the main deflector grid. It enhances the long-range sensors...
 DATA / The modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imaging resolution by twenty-five percent or more.
 RIKER / Sounds like that would take a lot of warp energy...
 GEORDI / We'd channel it through the EPS mains on Deck Thirteen... near Cargo Bay Four.
 RIKER / It's worth a try.
 GEORDI / (to Data) Data, let's get those subspace field taps on-line...
 DATA / (to Riker) Commander -- I would like to remind you about my poetry reading this afternoon.
 RIKER / Wouldn't miss it for the world.
 GEORDI / I can hardly wait to see what he came up with...
 DATA / (reading) "Then we sat on the sand for some time and observed How the oceans that cover this world were perturbed By the tides from the orbiting moon overhead 'How relaxing the sound of the waves is,' you said. (beat) "I began to expound upon tidal effects When you told me to stop, looking somewhat perplexed So I did not explain why the sunset turned red And we watched the occurrence in silence instead."
 RIKER / (softly, to Troi) I don't understand this... I can barely keep my eyes open...
 DATA / (to audience) That poem was written in anapestic tetrameter. For my ninth poem, we move to the iambic septameter mode. (beat) Throughout the ages, from Keats to Jorkemo, poets have composed odes to the individuals who have had a profound effect on their lives. In keeping with that tradition, I have written my next poem in honor of my cat. I call it "Ode to Spot."
 DATA / (reading) "Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses Contribute to your hunting skill and natural defenses."
 DATA / (continuing) "I find myself intrigued by your sub-vocal oscillations A singular development of cat communication That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection... "
 DATA / (continuing) "A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotions."
 DATA / (to Riker) You have prematurely anticipated my denouement, Commander. However, I appreciate the sentiment. (beat) I will continue.
 DATA / "Oh Spot, the complex level of behavior you display Connotes a fairly well-developed cognitive array And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend... "
 RIKER / I don't have any problem getting to sleep... and I think I'm sleeping all night... but when I wake up, I feel exhausted...
 BEVERLY / How long has this been going on?
 RIKER / The last two, three nights...
 RIKER / (re: tricorder) Do you have to hold that thing so close?
 RIKER / I'm sorry... I've been on edge all day.
 BEVERLY / Other than some muscle tension in your neck, I don't see anything wrong with you physically... (beat) Have you been having bad dreams?
 RIKER / Not that I can remember...
 BEVERLY / This may be the result of a lack of REM sleep...
 RIKER / What do you recommend?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Drink this before you go to bed.
 RIKER / (re: PADD) What is it?
 BEVERLY / A recipe for a warm milk toddy.
 RIKER / (playful) Warm milk toddy... you're kidding.
 BEVERLY / (right back at him) The heat activates amino acids in the lactose -- which acts as a natural sedative. (beat) Besides, this is a recipe of the Captain's Aunt Adelle. It's delicious.
 RIKER / At this point, I'll give anything a try. (beat) Thanks.
 GEORDI / (off console) Everything's in place... deflector grid couplers... subspace field taps... (beat) Let's do it. Lieutenant Shipley -- initiate warp power transfer...
 GEORDI / Come on... work...
 DATA / (to Geordi) Geordi -- active scanner output has increased by twenty-six percent.
 GEORDI / (to Shipley) Inform Astrophysics that the new La Forge sensor array is on-line and awaiting major scientific discoveries.
 DATA / Geordi... may I make a personal inquiry? It concerns my poetry reading.
 GEORDI / Sure, Data... what is it?
 DATA / I noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during my presentation. Was my poetry uninteresting?
 GEORDI / Well... it was very well constructed... a real tribute to form... (beat) I especially liked your Haiku poem...
 DATA / My Haiku was only three lines long.
 GEORDI / Yeah... it was great... very... brisk...
 DATA / Brisk... (beat) Geordi, are you saying that the shorter my poems, the better?
 GEORDI / No... well... sort of... (beat) To be honest, Data... some of your longer poems were a little dry.
 GEORDI / Maybe some of your poems were a little... formal.
 DATA / I have found poetry more challenging than other artistic endeavors. Unlike painting and musical composition, it demands a more articulated emotional content.
 GEORDI / Next time, don't worry so much about rhyme and meter. Some of the world's greatests poets didn't pay attention to rules...
 GEORDI / (re: alarm) That's the power grid warning...
 DATA / (off display) I am reading a massive EPS explosion.
 GEORDI / Where?
 DATA / I am attempting to localize it... (works) It is Cargo Bay Four.
 GEORDI / (reacts) I've got three people down there! (taps communicator) Damage control, medical team, to Cargo Bay Four! (to Data) Let's go...
 DATA / (off tricorder) The field imbalance has subsided. I believe it is safe to enter.
 WORF / (to all) There may still be a residual discharge. Stand clear.
 GEORDI / We analyzed the power conduits -- there's no evidence of an EPS explosion.
 RIKER / Sensors seemed to think there was...
 GEORDI / I think my modification to the sensor array may have caused a pattern recognition failure.
 RIKER / Just a sensor glitch?
 GEORDI / That's my guess.
 RIKER / Perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensor network. Make sure we haven't overlooked anything.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 RIKER / Maybe we should pick this up in the morning, Mister La Forge -- get a fresh start. (beat) And would you do me a favor? Stop by my quarters at oh-seven hundred hours. I've been having trouble waking up.
 GEORDI / Sure. Goodnight.
 RIKER / Goodnight.
 RIKER / (calls out) Who is it?
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Commander La Forge.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Good morning, sir.
 RIKER / (confused) Morning? I just went to bed...
 GEORDI / Sir -- it's oh seven hundred hours.
 WORF / I would like my hair trimmed.
 WORF / (ominous) Not like last time.
 GEORDI / (re: circuitry) Just before the grid alarm sounded, we were running warp power through this junction... somehow, it must've tripped the internal scanners...
 RIKER / And they showed it as an EPS explosion...
 GEORDI / The question is, why? I've made modifications to the sensors before... and nothing like this ever happened.
 RIKER / We can't waste time chasing down sensor ghosts. Keep the array off-line until you have a chance to take a closer look.
 GEORDI / (yawning) Aye sir...
 RIKER / (re: his yawn) I know the feeling... the past few nights, it seems the second my head hits the pillow, it's time to get up again.
 GEORDI / We could all use some shore leave after this survey.
 RIKER / Definitely. (beat) Keep me informed.
 GEORDI / (to Data) Data, will you give me a hand? I've got to run a structural integrity scan. I want to make sure the conduit wasn't weakened by the --
 GEORDI / Ow...
 DATA / What is it?
 GEORDI / (continuing) This is the second time today my VISOR's cut out...
 DATA / Are you alright, Geordi?
 GEORDI / I don't know... I just had a weird feeling... (beat) I think I'd better get to Sickbay...
 DATA / I will run the integrity scan.
 GEORDI / Thanks...
 BEVERLY / This is curious... (beat) There's a slight bacterial infection around your neural inputs... it was probably interrupting the data stream.
 GEORDI / (reacts) Infection... from what?
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) It doesn't match any bacterial strains on record...
 BEVERLY / I'm going to sterilize the area... but I'll need to run a resonance tissue scan to look for signs of additional infection...
 BEVERLY / Come over here...
 BEVERLY / You'll need to hold still...
 GEORDI / How's the scan going, Data?
 DATA / I have just started the scan. I thought you were going to Sickbay.
 GEORDI / I've been there for the past hour and a half.
 DATA / That is not possible. (thinks a beat) My internal chronometer indicates it has been exactly one minute, fifteen seconds since you left the room.
 GEORDI / I'm telling you, Data, I've been gone for over an hour.
 DATA / (to computer) Computer -- what time is it?
 DATA / You are correct. Ninety-two minutes, seventeen seconds have passed since you left the room.
 GEORDI / What have you been doing all this time?
 DATA / (thinks) I have no memory of events during that period. (beat) When we are finished here, I will perform a self-diagnostic.
 GEORDI / First we pick up a false EPS explosion... then my VISOR cuts out twice... now you lose an hour... all in the Cargo Bay... (taps communicator) La Forge to Engineering -- I want a diagnostic team to Cargo Bay Two immediately.
 RIKER / (to Rager) Ensign Rager -- cartography needs a better position to study cluster FGC-thirteen. (beat) Bring us about, heading one twenty three mark four.
 RIKER / First time navigating through a globular cluster, Ensign?
 RIKER / You've got to compensate for gravimetric interference before you...
 RIKER / No... I don't know... (indicates chair) Maintain your original course, Ensign...
 GEORDI / (re: console) Don't tell me...
 GEORDI / This can't be right... (calls to Data) Data, can you come take a look at this?
 GEORDI / (continuing) I think we've got another sensor glitch.
 DATA / The sensors are functioning normally... (beat) They are detecting a subspace particle emission originating from within this room.
 GEORDI / (reacts) Within this room... that's not possible...
 DATA / (off tricorder) The emission is emanating from this direction...
 DATA / Geordi...
 DATA / (to Picard, re: bulkhead) The structure of the bulkhead is being altered on a subatomic level. The metal itself is in a state of quasi-molecular flux.
 PICARD / What's causing it?
 GEORDI / This is where it gets pretty wild, Captain... (beat) Behind this panel, there's a junction we were using to transfer warp power to the sensor array. We're picking up a subspace particle stream emanating from that junction...
 DATA / It appears to be composed of spatially-inverted tetryon particles. (beat) We believe they are emanating from a tertiary subspace manifold.
 PICARD / (surprised) I thought tetryons were unstable in normal space...
 GEORDI / We don't understand it either, sir. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / Something from that deep in subspace shouldn't be able to exist in our universe... (indicates bulkhead) But here it is.
 PICARD / (re: wall) Does this pose a danger to the ship?
 GEORDI / Not unless it spreads... if it does, we could beam the bulkhead into space and erect a forcefield in its place.
 PICARD / Keep that option ready. For now, proceed with the analysis.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 RIKER / When I sat down at the console, it triggered a response... like I was trapped... I had to get out of there...
 TROI / Was it something about the console itself?
 RIKER / No... it seemed disconnected somehow... maybe it's something I dreamed...
 TROI / Wil... you're the third person today who's come to me with something like this... an intense emotional response provoked by an object...
 RIKER / Did anyone know why they had that reaction?
 TROI / No... they couldn't explain it any more than you could... (beat) At this point, I'm not willing to say it's coincidence.
 RIKER / Maybe we should all get together.
 TROI / Talking about it might help you understand the response... (beat) I'm going to find out if anyone else on the ship has been having experiences like this...
 TROI / (to Riker) Wil... you said you had an unusual reaction when you sat down at the console. What was it like?
 RIKER / It's hard to describe... it was vague... like the way you recall a dream... (beat) I remember the sensation of being trapped... and something about a smooth surface...
 TROI / (to all) Can anyone else describe what they felt?
 WORF / I had a similar response... to a pair of scissors.
 TROI / Have you had any dreams about scissors recently?
 WORF / I may have... I do not have a distinct memory of it...
 GEORDI / When my VISOR cut out in the Cargo Bay, I had a weird feeling too... something about a smooth surface... (beat) Smooth... and cold... I think it was cold...
 WORF / It was elevated... a platform...
 GEORDI / Right... a bench...
 GEORDI / Or a table...
 TROI / It sounds like you've all had a similar experience... (beat) Do you remember anything more about it besides the table?
 RIKER / Maybe there's a way we can help ourselves remember more...
 TROI / (to all) You all remember a table... let's start with that... (to computer) Computer -- show me a table...
 TROI / (to all) Can you remember anything specific about the table? You mentioned it was cold, and smooth... (beat) Do you remember what shape it was?
 GEORDI / Yeah... a rectangular shape...
 TROI / (to computer) Computer -- create a rectangular conference table.
 GEORDI / (to himself) It's too high... (to computer) Computer... decrease table height by... twenty-five percent...
 WORF / (re: table) No... the table was smaller... and it was inclined...
 WORF / (to computer) Computer -- decrease the table's surface area by... twenty percent... (beat) And incline the top... fifteen degrees...
 RIKER / It wasn't made of wood... it was smoother... more metallic...
 TROI / (to computer) Computer -- make this a metal table.
 GEORDI / (re: table) That's starting to look right...
 TROI / Was there anything else in the room? Furniture... chairs... a door... other people...
 RIKER / Dark, right... you couldn't see beyond the table...
 TROI / (to computer) Computer -- lower the surrounding light level.
 GEORDI / There was a light right in my face... a bright light... (beat) Computer -- give me a bright light... right above the table...
 GEORDI / (struggles) I couldn't tell.. it was above me... an overhead lamp...
 GEORDI / (annoyed) I don't know... (beat) It seemed like it was at least... two, three meters above...
 GEORDI / (to computer) Brighter...
 GEORDI / (to computer) Brighter.
 TROI / (to Riker) Wil... you said you were uneasy when you sat down at the Conn position...
 RIKER / Yeah... I felt trapped by the console... (beat) But it wasn't like this... there was something else here...
 TROI / A restraint of some kind?
 RIKER / Yes... a restraint... it came down over my legs... (beat) No, no... my chest... it came across my chest...
 TROI / It was holding you down...
 RIKER / (nods) Yes... it was part of the table...
 RIKER / Here... right here...
 TROI / (to computer) Computer -- create a restraining arm... attached to the right side of the table, at the mid-point...
 TROI / (re: restraint) Was it like that?
 RIKER / (to computer) Computer -- put controls on the restraint... a control panel... lights...
 WORF / There was something attached to it... (beat) A tool of some sort... scissor-like...
 WORF / (to computer) Computer -- produce a pair of scissors... attached to the armature...
 WORF / (re: scissors) The handle is wrong... (to himself) ... It wasn't scissors... (to computer) Computer -- make the handle a single grip... ten centimeters long... solid metal...
 WORF / (to computer) Make one blade longer... and curved inward...
 WORF / (continuing) Give the second blade a... jagged edge...
 PICARD / Tetryons... the same particles in the Cargo Bay...
 DATA / (to Picard) I have completed my self-diagnostic, and confirmed that I was not aboard the Enterprise for ninety minutes, seventeen seconds yesterday afternoon.
 PICARD / Explanation?
 DATA / Whenever I am on the ship, the warp field leaves an electromagnetic signature on my internal servo fluid system. Yesterday, between twelve fifty-four and fourteen twenty-six hours that signature is missing.
 PICARD / (to computer) Computer -- are there any crewmembers missing from the Enterprise?
 PICARD / Identify them.
 PICARD / When did they leave?
 RIKER / How did they leave?
 PICARD / (taps communicator) Picard to Bridge.
 PICARD / (to com) Raise shields and maintain a Level Four security alert -- I want to know if anyone goes on or off this ship.
 PICARD / (to Data, Geordi) Mister La Forge, Mister Data -- I believe if we find the source of those tetryon emissions, we may also find our missing crewmembers.
 GEORDI / We'll get on it, sir.
 MEDICAL N.D. (O.S.) / Doctor Crusher -- you'd better take a look at this...
 BEVERLY / My God...
 RIKER / What is it?
 BEVERLY / (to Riker) Commander... it looks as though your arm has been severed and reattached.
 RIKER / What?
 BEVERLY / The skeletal structure in your radius and ulna is offset by point zero two microns... (beat) Your arm has been amputated... then surgically reattached.
 GEORDI / (to Shipley) Any progress, Lieutenant?
 GEORDI / (to Data, re: bulkhead) Data -- the tetryon emissions have intensified. They seem to be focusing in this direction...
 GEORDI / (continuing, re: rupture) ... coalescing here... they're reading as a point of subspace energy.
 DATA / (re: rupture) It appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture.
 GEORDI / The way the tetryon emissions are modulating... it's like somebody is controlling the flow of energy...
 GEORDI / Data... some of the signals from the modifications I made to the sensor array dipped pretty deep into subspace... (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (beat) Maybe they caught somebody's attention...
 DATA / At the rate the rupture is expanding, we are in danger of a hull breach.
 GEORDI / Let's try surrounding it with a subspace containment field...
 RIKER / Other than the tetryon emissions in Cargo Bay Four, none of the internal sensors recorded anything unusual over the past three days.
 PICARD / Initiate a metallurgical analysis of the ship's hull -- subspace field incursions might have left a trace.
 WORF / (off console) Captain -- sensors indicate that Lieutenant Hagler has returned to the Enterprise. He is in his quarters, Deck Seven, Section Nineteen.
 BEVERLY / (to computer) Computer -- emergency entry, Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher.
 BEVERLY / (hits communicator, urgent) Crusher to Sickbay -- get a plasma infusion unit to Deck Seven, Section Nineteen!
 BEVERLY / (re: Hagler) His blood is transforming into some sort of... liquid polymer...
 GEORDI / We've set up a containment field in Cargo Bay Four. But the rupture just keeps expanding. I'd say we've got another five or six hours before it breaches the hull.
 PICARD / Can we still beam the affected sections into space?
 DATA / No sir. The spatial rupture is creating severe nucleonic interference. It is impossible to obtain a positive lock on the bulkheads.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Has your analysis suggested any way to seal the rupture?
 GEORDI / We think we could close the rupture by neutralizing the tetryon emissions with a coherent graviton pulse. But we'd have to do it at the source.
 RIKER / How do we find the source?
 GEORDI / That's a good question. The emissions are coming from a tertiary subspace domain. But subspace has an infinite number of domains... (beat) It's like a huge honeycomb with an endless number of cells. We need to isolate the exact cell the emissions are coming from...
 PICARD / (to Geordi) If someone homed in on subspace signals created by our modified sensor array... can we do the same thing to them -- track the tetryon emissions to their universe?
 DATA / Tetryon particles have a random momentum. Our sensors are unable to track them.
 WORF / Perhaps we could make a homing device -- something our sensors could track.
 GEORDI / Good idea. But there's no way to get that device to the source.
 RIKER / Yes, there is. (beat) Give it to me.
 RIKER / It's pretty clear I've been taken each of the past few nights... if I'm right, there's every chance it'll happen again tonight.
 GEORDI / (onto the idea) If you had a homing device, we could track it to your location in subspace... then, as soon as they send you back to the ship... we could transmit the graviton pulse and neutralize the tetryon emissions...
 TROI / If they send him back. Ensign Rager still hasn't been returned...
 RIKER / They're going to take me whether I want to go or not.
 PICARD / (to Riker) We'll wait as long as we can for you to be returned, Number One. But as soon the spatial rupture threatens the ship... we'll have to transmit that graviton pulse.
 RIKER / Understood.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Perhaps we can give you an advantage... a way of keeping you conscious after they take you...
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Doctor -- can you develop a counter-agent to the neuro-sedative they've been giving the crew?
 BEVERLY / I could try a neuro-stimulant -- but the dosage would have to be pretty high to counter the effects. It might be risky.
 RIKER / It's a risk I'm willing to take.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Make it so. (to Geordi) Mister La Forge -- begin work on a homing device.
 BEVERLY / It should be enough to ward off their neuro-sedative for about twelve hours.
 RIKER / I hope that's enough.
 BEVERLY / It'll have to be. I can't risk giving you a higher dosage.
 GEORDI / I've locked the tricorder into continuous scan. That way, it'll keep recording whether you open it or not. (beat) Maybe you can bring back some information about their universe.
 GEORDI / (re: device) When you see this indicator light up, it means we've locked onto the signal.
 RIKER / Understood.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Report.
 GEORDI / (off console) I still can't locate the homing signal... (beat, working) We've covered the entire upper-subspace energy band. We're extending the scan to adjacent energy levels...
 PICARD / (taps communicator) Picard to Data. Your status?
 DATA / (to com) The rupture has expanded another four point two percent. Without further reinforcement, containment field integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes.
 PICARD / Can you divert more power to the containment field?
 GEORDI / I can try to augment the field with auxiliary power, but it won't be much...
 PICARD / Make it so.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / Captain -- I've located the homing signal. Locking onto it now... (beat) It's coming from a subspace energy level of sixteen point-two K-E-V...
 PICARD / Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Data. How much time?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / At the present rate, containment failure will occur in approximately nine minutes.
 DATA / (to com) Captain -- the containment field is beginning to fluctuate. Failure anticipated in three minutes, eleven seconds.
 PICARD / We can't afford to wait any longer... (beat) Begin the graviton pulse.
 GEORDI / (works) Initiating pulse... now.
 DATA / (to com) Data to Engineering. The graviton pulse is having an effect. The tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent...
 DATA / (to com) Captain -- additional subharmonics have appeared. They are reinforcing the tetryon emissions... (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (reads console) They appear to be counter-acting the graviton pulse... (beat) The rupture is beginning to expand again.
 GEORDI / Looks like somebody's fighting back...
 PICARD / Can you strengthen the graviton pulse?
 GEORDI / (nods) I'll try setting up a random frequency shift. If we can keep them from guessing our pulse modulation... they might not be able to compensate...
 DATA / (off console) Tetryon emissions continue to increase. (beat) The rupture is still expanding. Hull breach is imminent.
 GEORDI / (off console, frustrated) They're reacting faster than we can shift frequencies...
 GEORDI / (to Shipley) Shipley -- program the emitters for full spectrum pulse compression. I want to channel all of the graviton energy into a single burst... (beat) Let's see if they can handle that...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / The rupture is beginning to close.
 GEORDI / (to Shipley) Recharge the emitters! Let's hit them again!
 GEORDI / (impatient) Come on...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / The rupture is ninety-six percent closed.
 GEORDI / We're almost there. One more burst should do it...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46119.2. The tetryon emissions in Cargo Bay Four have ceased, and there have been no further indications of alien intrusions. All Enterprise crewmembers are safe and accounted for. But we are still left with some unanswered questions...
 DATA / Based on the information gathered by Commander Riker's tricorder, we have determined that the molecular structure of the alien life forms is solanogen-based.
 GEORDI / We think that's why they couldn't come through into our space, as easily as they could take us into theirs... (beat) They needed to learn how to remodulate their cellular energy states in order to survive in our universe.
 DATA / The tricorder readings indicate they created a small pocket of our universe in their lab to keep those who were abducted alive.
 RIKER / Like putting a fish in a bucket of water...
 GEORDI / They were probably trying to do the same thing in Cargo Bay Four -- create a pocket of their universe in ours.
 PICARD / What can we do to prevent this from happening again?
 GEORDI / It looks like they found us initially by discovering my modified sensor signal. We should warn all Starfleet ships not to make the same mistake.
 PICARD / (to Data, Geordi) Have you any idea what came through the rupture, before you were able to shut it down?
 DATA / No sir. We were unable to track it once it left the Cargo Bay.
 GEORDI / Maybe it was a probe of some kind...
 DATA / Perhaps they are simply curious. Explorers, like ourselves.
 RIKER / Ensign Rager and I were lucky to escape... and Lieutenant Hagler's dead... (beat) I have a feeling that whoever sent that thing... was more than simply curious.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46192.3. We have arrived at Starbase one-one-two and are loading relief supplies destined for Tagra Four, an ecologically devastated planet in the Argolis Cluster. We have also taken on a rather unusual passenger.
 PICARD / Welcome to the Enterprise. We're delighted to have you aboard.
 PICARD / Congratulations. I understand you were selected from among hundreds of applicants for this internship.
 BEVERLY / Your transcript is very impressive... (to Picard) She's done honors work in neurobiology, plasma dynamics, and eco-regeneration. I'd call that pretty well-rounded.
 BEVERLY / I've arranged to have you work in all the major departments while you're here. I'm willing to bet that by the time it's over you'll have a pretty good idea what field you're interested in.
 PICARD / (smiles) Or at least what fields you're not interested in.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER ENTERS. / 
 RIKER / We're bringing up the last of the cargo, sir. We should be ready to leave within the hour.
 PICARD / Commander, would you escort Ms. Rogers to her quarters? I have to discuss the Tagran's medical needs with Doctor Crusher.
 PICARD / You've won yourself a rare opportunity. Avail yourself of it.
 RIKER / It'll take a few days before you know your way around. If you ever need help just use one of the companels...
 RIKER / (surprised) That's right.
 RIKER / You're a quick study.
 RIKER / This is it.
 RIKER / All yours.
 RIKER / (smiles) For honor students, only the best.
 RIKER / The zoo?
 RIKER / (smiles) Depends how they get along.
 RIKER / We'll try and keep you so busy you won't have time to. (he smiles) I'd better be going; I have to get back to the Cargo Bay.
 BEVERLY / See these readouts? This is your heart rate, your blood pressure... all your vital signs.
 BEVERLY / You're in good shape. (wry) You might just live to be my age.
 BEVERLY / All these tricorders have to be tested before they get put in the supply containers we're taking to Tagra.
 BEVERLY / (nods) If they're not, put that unit aside and we'll run a diagnostic on it.
 BEVERLY / So I understand you were accepted to the Academy... I have a son there.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) Not as often as I'd like.
 BEVERLY / My husband died a number of years ago. Wes was our only child.
 BEVERLY / Jack died when he was five.
 BEVERLY / I understand your adopted parents are in Starfleet.
 BEVERLY / On my way. (to Amanda) I have to go. When you've finished with the tricorders, Nurse Ogawa can help you take them down to the Shuttlebay for loading.
 GEORDI / Thanks for your help. We need every spare hand we can get; this is one of the biggest relief efforts we've ever mounted.
 GEORDI / We can't use the transporters because of all the ionization in the Tagran atmosphere.
 GEORDI / (a little surprised) How'd you know that?
 GEORDI / Then you know that a thousand barystatic filters put out a lot of ionization...
 GEORDI / They've managed to pollute their atmosphere pretty badly.
 GEORDI / (simply) You're right.
 GEORDI'S VOICE / All the filters can do is keep things from getting worse. They shoot negative ions into the planet's stratosphere --
 GEORDI'S VOICE / (continuing) -- where they come into contact with airborne pollutants and transfer their charge. The filters have positively charged intake vents that the pollutants become attracted to; that sets up a kind of ionic current in the atmosphere.
 GEORDI / (calling from across the room) Commander, are you all right?
 RIKER / Yeah... I didn't even see it coming...
 TROI / Commander Riker told me you liked dogs...
 TROI / This is Henry.
 TROI / (shrugging) Don't ask me.
 TROI / Ensign Janklow is going to the Gantol excavations for three weeks. He's been trying to find someone to take care of Henry.
 TROI / (smiles) Okay. But be warned -- he has an appetite for boots.
 TROI / Doctor Crusher tells me you're considering a career in zoology.
 TROI / There's nothing wrong with keeping your options open.
 TROI / Amanda... whatever you choose, I'm sure you'll be good at it.
 TROI / Who knows? Maybe you will.
 GEORDI / -- this is the main control area. We can access just about any primary circuit from these panels. (indicating) That's a Jeffries tube over there --
 GEORDI / (smiles) You've done your homework.
 DATA / Imagination is not necessary; the scale is readily quantifiable. (glancing at console) We are presently generating twelve point seven-five billion gigawatts per second.
 DATA / The temperature in the reaction chamber has increased by forty-seven percent.
 GEORDI / (working) The injector couplings are frozen -- I can't slow the reaction...
 DATA / Temperature increase is at one hundred six percent... and rising.
 GEORDI / (to com) La Forge To Bridge!
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard, here.
 GEORDI / We're heading for a core breach! We're going to have to try and vent the plasma!
 DATA / (working) Plasma inductors are not responding.
 GEORDI / We're going to lose containment...
 GEORDI / (to Data) Bring down the isolation door - we have to eject the warp core.
 GEORDI / (to others) Everybody out! Move it!
 DATA / Temperature in the reaction chamber is back to normal.
 BEVERLY / She's a little shaken up, but she'll be all right.
 RIKER / You said she was adopted... could she be an alien?
 BEVERLY / She's human... and there's nothing unusual about her, not that my instruments can detect.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Commander, have you been able to determine the cause of the warp breach?
 GEORDI / No, sir. Everything was normal and then... it's like the laws of physics suddenly went out the window.
 PICARD / (dismayed) Q...
 PICARD / Are you responsible for the incident in Engineering?
 PICARD / That being?
 TROI / Amanda... is a Q... ?
 BEVERLY / How is that possible? Her parents... her biological parents... were human.
 BEVERLY / I'm sure that's beyond your comprehension, Q.
 TROI / What happened to Amanda's parents?
 RIKER / (sarcastic) You, an expert on humanity... ?
 GEORDI / Are you saying you caused the core breach -- just to test her?
 TROI / What if she hadn't been able to stop it?
 BEVERLY / Now that you know, what do you intend to do?
 PICARD / Somehow I find it hard to believe that you'd come here to do us a favor...
 BEVERLY / And once you've taught her... you'll go away?
 BEVERLY / (irate) Wait a minute... you can't just come in here and take her away from everything she's known...
 BEVERLY / She has plans for herself... she wants a career, a family --
 BEVERLY / That "miserable existence" is all she's known for eighteen years. You have no right to take it away from her.
 PICARD / What is it you really want, Q? Why bring Amanda here... to the Enterprise?
 PICARD / Trust you -- !
 PICARD / I don't trust you and I certainly wouldn't expect Amanda to.
 PICARD / She may not want that future. The decision is hers.
 PICARD / If Amanda is a Q... she'll need to understand what that means. (firm) I'll introduce you, but we cannot continue to fight like this in front of Amanda. For her sake, we'll have to appear to be...
 PICARD / Civil.
 PICARD / We need time to explain this to her.
 PICARD / Mister Data... I want you to access any available records on Amanda Rogers.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / I want to know more about her biological parents... about their death. I find it odd that any Q could die in an accident.
 DATA / It does not seem consistent with what we know of them.
 PICARD / I'm convinced Q isn't telling us everything. See what you can find out.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / I can understand that. (beat) The person I mentioned... from the Q Continuum... would like to meet you. If you want to...
 PICARD / Amanda, this is Q. (beat) He is... (searching) ... an acquaintance of ours. We've known him for years.
 PICARD / I think what Q means to ask is... have you deliberately used your abilities... ?
 PICARD / (warning) Q --
 PICARD / (stepping forward) She doesn't want to --
 PICARD / You agreed she has the right to decide her own future... yet the first chance you get you try to abduct her.
 PICARD / What's going on, Q? What's your real purpose in being here?
 PICARD / If you intend to protect that investment, I suggest you approach her differently.
 PICARD / If I'm not mistaken, she just did.
 BEVERLY / You can still do those things...
 BEVERLY / But you have to.
 BEVERLY / I know how you feel. It would be so much easier if none of this had happened... if it would just go away. (beat) But it's not going to go away.
 BEVERLY / You need someone to help you. And the person who can help you -- is Q.
 BEVERLY / But he's the only one who can help you understand who you are. There are hard choices you're going to have to make about your future... and you can't make them by ignoring the truth.
 BEVERLY / You've got a deal. The first free hour you have, report to me in the medical lab. I have an experiment I need help with.
 BEVERLY / Twenty milliliters...
 BEVERLY / That's it. (hands her a PADD) Just be sure and record the rate of mitosis in each dish.
 BEVERLY / You seem a little distracted.
 BEVERLY / No... I don't think I can.
 BEVERLY / You're stronger than you think, Amanda...
 BEVERLY / (slight laugh) I have no idea --
 BEVERLY / I... I'm not sure. I'd probably want to cure people... people who were hopelessly ill.
 BEVERLY / Oh, Amanda, I don't know... I don't think I could decide about something like that until I was faced with it...
 BEVERLY / Go on with your work. I'll be back to check on you later.
 PICARD / Number One... Doctor Crusher has some live vaccine bacilli for delivery to Tagra... they'll need to be shipped in a stasis field. Will you make the arrangements?
 RIKER / I'll get right on it.
 DATA / Captain, there is a message from Tagra Four.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Perhaps my Chief Engineer could assist you... ?
 PICARD / Send us your design specifications -- I'm sure we can do something.
 DATA / Captain... may I see you for a moment?
 PICARD / What is it, Mister Data?
 DATA / I have some information regarding Amanda Rogers' parents.
 DATA / Records indicate that they died in Topeka, Kansas. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / Their home was destroyed during a tornado.
 PICARD / A tornado? Why wasn't it dissipated by the Weather Modification Net?
 DATA / Unknown, sir. The bodies were found in the rubble after the storm had passed.
 PICARD / (a beat as he ponders) See if you can find out any details. I'd like to know more about that storm.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 RIKER / (ignoring him; to Amanda) I'm looking for Doctor Crusher. I don't know what nutrients she wants to ship with the bacilli.
 RIKER / Thanks.
 RIKER / (smiles) Just tell her I'll be in Shuttlebay Two.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 BEVERLY / (surprised) You've finished already?
 BEVERLY / How did you do it so quickly?
 BEVERLY / That explains this data. (puts the Padd down, addresses Q) I needed to know the rates of mitosis. By artificially accelerating them you made the experiment useless. Now I'll have to do it over again.
 BEVERLY / (firm) Why did you interfere with what she was doing?
 BEVERLY / She has asked not to be treated differently.
 BEVERLY / I don't interfere with what you're trying to teach Amanda --
 BEVERLY / (right over him) I don't think it's too much to ask for you to do the same --
 BEVERLY / -- and you stay out of mine.
 DATA / Captain...
 PICARD / Yes, Mister Data?
 DATA / I have more information regarding the tornado that killed Amanda Rogers' parents.
 PICARD / What is it?
 DATA / It was unusually compact, yet extremely powerful -- its recorded wind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size.
 PICARD / Download the files to my Ready Room. I'll study them in there.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / The trick is to come up with a field modulater that doesn't require shutting down their reactor...
 DATA / If we use (TECH), we can devise a mechanism that integrates into the existing system while it is in operation.
 BEVERLY / Hello, Amanda. Are you ready?
 TROI / Is there something else you'd like to order, Amanda?
 TROI / I see. (beat) How are you feeling about all this now? It must be overwhelming.
 RIKER'S VOICE / Hello, ladies...
 TROI / Hello, Wil...
 RIKER / Thanks, but I'm meeting someone.
 BEVERLY / (to Amanda) How are the lessons going? Is Q being patient with you?
 RIKER / (evenly) What's this all about?
 RIKER / I think you should take us back to Ten Forward.
 RIKER / It's very pleasant. But that's not the point...
 RIKER / No... (beat) You can't just snatch people away and put them in your fantasies... and expect them to respond.
 RIKER / I think you're a lovely young woman. But -- none of this is real.
 RIKER / I know that... but -- you can't make someone... love you.
 RIKER / Amanda...
 RIKER / You're so beautiful...
 RIKER / Yes... more than anything...
 RIKER / (solicitous) Amanda...
 PICARD / Yes. I want to ask you about Amanda's biological parents. When they decided to remain on Earth, what was the reaction in the Continuum?
 PICARD / Were they pressured to come back? Were they threatened with punishment if they didn't?
 PICARD / The circumstance of their death was a bit odd... a tornado that escaped the Weather Modification Net... and then touched down in only one spot -- Amanda's home.
 PICARD / Tornadoes develop from existing storm fronts... and there were no storm fronts in Kansas that day. Witnesses reported that the funnel materialized spontaneously... directly over Amanda's home... destroyed it... and then disappeared.
 PICARD / Were Amanda's parents executed... by the Q Continuum?
 PICARD / Then I think Amanda has the right to know that before she makes a choice about her future.
 PICARD / Are you that despicable, Q?
 PICARD / And... what have you concluded? Does she live... or does she die?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 46193.8. We have arrived at Tagra Four and have begun delivering supplies. In the meantime, I am faced with a crisis of a different nature.
 PICARD / I have no reason to believe Q is lying. He has orders from the Continuum... if Amanda doesn't prove herself to be fully Q... he must kill her.
 TROI / We have to tell her...
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure we should... it seems almost cruel.
 TROI / Maybe she can protect herself... after all, she has a great deal of power.
 BEVERLY / So did her parents, and it didn't save them.
 PICARD / I'm inclined to agree that Amanda deserves to know the truth of the situation. We don't have the right to withhold such crucial information. (beat) But it won't be easy telling her...
 RIKER / What's your impression of the field modulator, Mister Lote?
 GEORDI / We're all loaded. We can head for the surface whenever you're ready.
 RIKER / Why don't we get going... ?
 PICARD / They're not convinced you're fully Q.
 PICARD / They were responsible for the death of your parents...
 PICARD / Amanda's question deserves an answer, Q. You've made yourself judge, jury, and -- if necessary -- executioner. By what right do you appoint yourself to this position?
 PICARD / I recall how you used your superior morality when we first encountered you. You put us on trial for the crimes of humanity.
 PICARD / Your arrogant pretense to being the moral guardians of the universe strikes me as a bit pale today. You have shown no evidence that you are guided by a superior moral code -- by any code whatsoever. You may be nearly omnipotent -- I won't deny your parlor tricks are impressive -- but morality? No, I don't see it. I don't acknowledge it. I would put human morality against the Q's any day.
 PICARD / Perhaps that's the fascination we humans hold for you... ? That by our puny example we give you a glimmer of the one thing that eludes your omnipotence -- a moral center.
 PICARD / If so, I can think of no crueler irony than for you to destroy a young woman whose only crime... is being too human.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Picard -- there is an emergency message from Commander Riker.
 PICARD / On my way.
 RIKER / Captain, the damage to the reactor was greater than the Tagrans led us to believe. The field modulator is installed and operational, but it's not going to be enough... the reactor's gone into overload...
 PICARD / Can you correct the problem?
 RIKER / La Forge is trying to stabilize the unit now. We'll stay as long as possible... there are thousands of people in the area, and if that reactor goes...
 PICARD / Is this your doing, Q -- ?
 PICARD / Mister Worf, see if there's anything we can do to cut through the interference and beam them out of there.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Captain, La Forge is trying a neutrino infusion. There's a chance it'll smother the reaction...
 WORF / Sir, there is too much ionization in the atmosphere, transporters are useless.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / It didn't work, sir. Meltdown is imminent.
 GEORDI / This is impossible...
 GEORDI / I don't know what's happening, sir -- but the reaction is stabilizing on its own.
 DATA / Sir... I am reading a massive energy fluctuation in the planet's atmosphere.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / Atmospheric contaminants have dropped to less than one part per trillion. (glancing at Picard) The ecosystem has been restored to its natural state.
 PICARD / Amanda... ?
 BEVERLY / (smiling) You're a Q... you can do anything you want.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46235.7 Ensign Ro, Keiko O'Brien, Guinan and I are returning to the Enterprise after a fascinating visit to the planet Marlonia.
 PICARD, GUINAN, KEIKO and RO are in the back of the / shuttle, relaxing. The atmosphere is very informal. Picard is still energized by his recent trip and is showing Guinan some odd pieces of pottery from a small box.
 PICARD / ... and I found these pieces in the tertiary level of the dig. They're typical of second century Marlonian cookware.
 PICARD / Now, see these markings... they're very similar to some early Taguan designs... but the patterns are more intricate... closer to Buranian than Taguan.
 PICARD / It was a very rewarding experience. (holds up shards) Look at these fragments... they're in nearly perfect condition... and they're over seven hundred years old.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Enterprise to Shuttlecraft Fermi...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We have just received a distress signal from the Starfleet science team on Ligos Seven.
 PICARD / Any indication of the problem?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / No, sir. The call was cut off mid-transmission.
 PICARD / Lay in a course and prepare to engage at Warp eight once we're aboard.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Hard about, full impulse.
 RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations, various / SUPERNUMERARIES.
 RIKER / (to Worf) What's happening, Mister Worf?
 WORF / The shuttle's been enveloped by an energy field, sir. (MORE)
 WORF (Cont'd) / Their engines and life support have failed.
 RIKER / (to Conn officer) Increase to full impulse. (to com) Bridge to Transporter Room Three. Prepare to beam the shuttle crew aboard once we're in range.
 PICARD / Transfer auxiliary power to the inertial dampers...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / O'Brien, do you have them?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / The shuttle's coming apart, Chief. You've got to do it now.
 BEVERLY, medical tricorder in hand, finishes her / examination of Young Picard. Troi is with her. In the b.g., Young Ro, Young Guinan and Young Keiko sit on biobeds while an N.D. conducts tests with a tricorder. NOTE: "child" versions now wear smaller, replicated clothes, with normal sized insignias. They are still examining the fit of their new clothes.
 BEVERLY / (to Riker) According to the bio-scans, their DNA structures are now consistent with those of pre-adolescents. But as far as I can tell, only their bodies have changed.
 TROI / (off PADD) Their individual intelligence and behavioral responses are all exactly the same as they were before the accident.
 RIKER / The shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out. Data's coordinating the salvage effort right now. (beat) Sir.
 BEVERLY / What about the energy field the shuttle passed through?
 RIKER / We've been trying to scan it, but it's putting out a lot of interference. It's going to take some time.
 BEVERLY / Captain... there are some additional tests I'd like to run...
 WORF / (quickly) The probe. Aye, sir.
 DATA / Almost, sir. It is being stored in Shuttlebay Two.
 BEVERLY / Captain, may I see you privately for a few moments?
 BEVERLY / Not yet. I'm still waiting for some test results.
 BEVERLY / We'll be ready.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc. (he looks up) I think we need to talk.
 BEVERLY / I'd rather not have to take that step.
 BEVERLY / That's true... for now. This could be the first stage of a condition which may begin to affect your mind as well.
 BEVERLY / Not yet. (beat) What I do know is that the Captain of this ship has just gone through an extreme physical transformation... the ultimate effects of which I can't even begin to guess.
 BEVERLY / You're still Jean-Luc Picard... what do you think you should do?
 RIKER / Understood, sir.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's Log: Supplemental. The Enterprise has reached the Ligos system, and we have begun to search for the missing Federation science team. Doctor Crusher reports no progress on finding a cure for the members of the shuttle crew.
 TROI / I came to see how you're doing.
 TROI / What's wrong?
 TROI / I would say the people who know you, who've worked with you for years, will be able to make the adjustment eventually. (beat) But... there are some cultures that would not accept a twelve-year-old captain as a negotiating partner or a credible emissary.
 TROI / You're still a captain... I'm sure there are other assignments you could be given.
 TROI / You could return to the Academy... get another degree... brush up on your Latin.
 TROI / Then perhaps you could use this time to explore another interest... archeology for instance?
 TROI / Not permanently... just a sabbatical. You could spend ten years crawling through caves and digging up artifacts... and still have enough time to become the youngest admiral in Starfleet.
 TROI / In a way, you're very lucky. You have a chance do what most people can only dream about... have a second childhood without the pain of growing up.
 BEVERLY / This is Captain Picard's rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure from a tissue sample I took this morning. It's the same as a sample I took before the accident -- except it's missing several key viroxic sequences.
 RIKER / I'm afraid it's been a long time since I took genetics, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / RVN is one of the key factors in our development during puberty. Unlike DNA, which never changes, RVN takes on additional viroxic sequences during adolescence. Those sequences determine how we develop physically. Without them...
 RIKER / We would never mature into adults.
 BEVERLY / Exactly. Somehow, those key sequences were eliminated in the Captain and the others during transport.
 RIKER / So what can we do?
 BEVERLY / There are a couple of options.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) These are the plants Keiko was carrying on the shuttle. Whatever turned the crew into children turned these into seedlings.
 BEVERLY / We accelerated the growth on one of them, and it developed into a perfectly normal adult plant.
 RIKER / I don't suppose that would work on people.
 BEVERLY / No... but it does tell us that if we do nothing, they'll probably grow up as they did before.
 RIKER / That's one option...
 BEVERLY / I do have adult RVN patterns on all four of them. I might be able to send them back through the Transporter pattern buffer and replace the missing sequences... but we can't even attempt that until we know why this happened in the first place. (beat) If they were, somehow, to lose more viroxic sequences...
 RIKER / (grim) They'd come back even younger.
 GEORDI / I've got the sensor report on the shuttle break-up.
 GEORDI / It looks like the break-up began near the starboard bulkhead.
 GEORDI / My VISOR's picking up torsional stress damage... some micro-fractures... (beat) Wait a minute... what's this?
 GEORDI / Yeah... but watch.
 GEORDI / It's not tritanium anymore... somehow the molecular structure of the alloy's been changed -- broken down into its constituent elements...
 GEORDI / Let's get a sample down to Engineering. I want to run a metallurgical analysis.
 GEORDI / We think the shuttle was caught in a molecular reversion field, which caused the structure of the ship to deteriorate. When the field penetrated the hull, it also began to affect the shuttle crew.
 BEVERLY / (finally understanding) If the Transporter only registered part of their RVN patterns... that would explain why the key sequences are missing.
 GEORDI / Exactly. And without those key sequences, the Transporter reconstructed them as children.
 RIKER / (to Beverly) If they're right, will you be able to use the Transporter to reverse the effects?
 BEVERLY / I think so. As long as there's no reversion field to mask the patterns, we should be able to do it. (to O'Brien) Chief, can we adjust the molecular imaging scanners to accept --
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Commander Riker.
 RIKER / (to com) Go ahead.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We're entering orbit around Ligos Seven, sir.
 RIKER / On my way. (to others) We'll discuss this later.
 RIKER / (to Conn) Standard orbit, Ensign. (to Data) Any sign of the science team?
 DATA / We have been scanning the area since entering the system, but our readings are being disrupted.
 RIKER / Cause?
 DATA / Extreme fluctuations in the E.M. field.
 DATA / However, there is no evidence of relevant stellar or seismic activity which would cause the interference.
 RIKER / Any response to our hails, Mister Worf?
 WORF / No, sir. I have been attempting to--- (suddenly sees something on console) Commander, two ships decloaking fore and aft. (beat) Klingon birds of prey... B'rel class.
 RIKER / Maximum shields. Take us out of orbit, Ensign. Mister Worf, prepare to return fire...
 RIKER / Damage report.
 WORF / (reading console) We've lost primary life-support. Switching to secondary systems.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Lock phasers on target bearing to port.
 WORF / Phasers locked.
 RIKER / Fire.
 DATA / Minor damage to one ship. Its shields are holding.
 WORF / Starboard power coupling is down... warp engines off-line.
 RIKER / Shields?
 WORF / Down to thirteen percent.
 WORF / Casualties reported on decks twenty-six and twenty-seven...
 DATA / Sensors and secondary generators off-line... life support down to sixty-seven percent...
 RIKER / (to Com) Engineering, status report.
 GEORDI / Their last shots took out auxiliary power and emergency back-ups. It'll take at least an hour to get warp power back on-line.
 WORF / We've lost shields. Heavy casualties on decks thirty-five through forty.
 DATA / (reacts; off console) I am detecting Transporter signatures in three cargo bays. (beat) We are being boarded.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Initiate intruder alert. All security teams to proceed to --
 RIKER / (urgent, to com) Computer, deactivate all command functions. Authorization, Riker-Omega-Three...
 RIKER / I'm in command of this vessel. Who are you and on whose authority do you --
 RIKER / I hope your profit margin is pretty high on this little adventure, Lurin... because you're risking war with the Federation.
 RIKER / So that's what this is all about. What did you do with the science team that was on the surface?
 RIKER / You made them slave laborers.
 RIKER / You don't really think I'm going to help you.
 RIKER / (tight) One thousand, fourteen.
 RIKER / What's going on?
 RIKER / (awkward) So... son. How are you?
 RIKER / And what about your friends... Keiko and Guinan and Ro?
 RIKER / What's wrong?
 RIKER / I know. The Ferengi made Daddy turn off the main computer.
 RIKER / I don't know if they'll let me do that, Jean-Luc, but I'll ask.
 RIKER / That's right.
 RIKER / Then I suppose that's your loss. We consider our families to be one of our strengths.
 RIKER / Even you aren't that cruel.
 RIKER / All right... all right... just don't harm my son.
 RIKER / (to com) Computer, release command control to this station. Authorization, Riker-Omega-Three.
 RIKER / (quickly) Okay, Morta. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processing cores cross linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat and fourteen kiloquad interface modules. The core elements are based on FTL nanoprocessor units arranged into twenty-five bilateral kelilactirals with twenty of those units being slaved to the central heisenfram terminal. (beat) You do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is, don't you?
 RIKER / No, of course not. (points to something on console) Now this is the isopalavial interface which controls the main firomactal drive unit. (slaps Morta's hand away) Don't touch that, you'll blow up the entire firomactal drive.
 RIKER / That is the firomactal drive unit...
 RIKER'S VOICE / (continuing) ... it controls the central ramistat core and also keeps the ontarian manifold within forty thousand KRG.
 RIKER / ... so one more time. The ramistat kiloquad capacity is a function of the square root of the intermix ratio times the sum of the plasma injector quotient.
 RIKER / There's one more.
 BEVERLY / I'm loading the adult patterns into the buffer...
 BEVERLY / How do you feel, Captain?
 PICARD / I feel fine. Everything just seems... smaller.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46271.5. The Enterprise has entered orbit of Deinonychus Seven. But our scheduled rendezvous with the supply ship Biko has been delayed for another forty-eight hours.
 PICARD is sitting in a chair, playing a quiet MELODY / on his FLUTE (as seen in "The Inner Light"). Over the com system, two other instruments can be heard -- a CLARINET and a CELLO. Picard is playing along with the music form a pleasant harmony.
 PICARD (V.O.) / (continuing) In the meantime, many members of the crew are taking advantage of the delay to pursue their own projects... myself included.
 PICARD / (to computer) Computer -- stop playback.
 PICARD / (continuing) Change the clarinet to an oboe. Continue recording.
 PICARD / (to computer) Pause program.
 PICARD / Come.
 GEORDI and DATA ENTER. Geordi is enthusiastic about / something.
 GEORDI / Captain -- we'd like permission to take the Engineering computer off-line for a couple of hours. (beat) We've been working on a new interface that'll allow Data to act as an emergency back-up in case of a ship-wide systems failure.
 DATA / In theory, my neural network should be able to sustain key systems until primary control is restored.
 PICARD / It sounds like an intriguing experiment. I'll be very interested to see the results. (beat) Permission granted.
 GEORDI / It's possible we may even be able to run secondary systems through Data. Weapons control... sensor arrays...
 PICARD / Yes. I get the idea, Mister La Forge. Thank you. Please proceed.
 PICARD / (to computer) Computer -- record again from the first measure.
 PICARD / Computer -- pause program.
 PICARD / Come.
 BEVERLY ENTERS. She looks determined about something. / 
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, I need to talk with you about "Something for Breakfast."
 BEVERLY / (prompting) The play.
 PICARD / Ah... yes... a very intriguing drama. But I really don't have the time it would take to learn a part. And anyway, I'm not much of an actor...
 BEVERLY / That's no problem. You wouldn't be playing one of the leads.
 PICARD / Oh.
 BEVERLY / It's a very small part. Only two lines in the whole play.
 PICARD / Really.
 BEVERLY / You play the butler.
 PICARD / Let me read the play again... and I'll let you know.
 BEVERLY / You'll be wonderful, Jean-Luc. Rehearsal's at one thirty this afternoon.
 PICARD / Computer -- continue recording.
 PICARD / Enter.
 WORF ENTERS, stops at the desk. / 
 WORF / Captain, I am sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to consult you regarding the duty roster.
 PICARD / Proceed.
 WORF / I was hoping we could take advantage of the Biko's delay by staging shipwide security drills. I have planned a tentative schedule...
 PICARD / Very impressive, Mister Worf. But we'll be taking on new personnel at Starbase One-Eighteen in a few weeks. Surely the drills can wait until then.
 WORF / In that case, I will use the time to perform maintenance checks on the forward phaser array.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... is there some reason you're trying to give yourself more work?
 WORF / No sir. I simply wished to use the extra time to...
 PICARD / (cutting in) ... Enjoy yourself. You have some free time. Use it.
 WORF / Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / (to computer) Computer, once more from the top.
 WORF / The Captain saw fit to release me from my duties.
 WORF / I can go.
 WORF / (to Alexander) Where are we?
 WORF / What is our function here?
 WORF / We are in charge of law enforcement?
 WORF / You wrote this Holodeck program yourself?
 WORF / (to himself) I must talk with Mister Barclay...
 DATA / Geordi... I have noticed that you have not shaved in several days. Are you attempting to grow another beard?
 GEORDI / As a matter of fact, I am... (re: beard) What do you think?
 DATA / As is the case with many natural growth processes, it is difficult to envision the end product based on an intermediate stage.
 GEORDI / You're right -- give it a few more days.
 GEORDI / Okay... I'll need to access your auxiliary inputs...
 DATA / One moment.
 GEORDI / I have to admit, Data... I never get used to seeing you like this...
 DATA / I do not understand. You are constantly working on similar electronic systems, yet their appearances do not disturb you.
 GEORDI / Yeah, well... you're not just another electronic system.
 DATA / Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you just another biological organism.
 GEORDI / That should do it. Are you ready?
 DATA / Yes. (beat) I am establishing computer link-up...
 DATA / Interface complete.
 GEORDI / Alright... let's see what you can do...
 WORF / So I am here to apprehend him?
 WORF / (to Eli) You are under arrest.
 WORF / You will come with me.
 WORF / What is wrong?
 WORF / Oh.
 WORF / (to Alexander) Where are they going?
 WORF / (to Eli) You are under arrest --
 WORF / (to Eli) You have been accused of committing a homicide.
 WORF / I am beginning to see the appeal of this program...
 WORF / You are a murderer... and a thief.
 TROI / (to Eli, a threat) I suggest you find a new line of work.
 DATA / I am now attempting to access the long range sensor array...
 GEORDI / Forward sensor array coming online... we're getting a clear scan...
 DATA / I will perform a routine maintenance check on the starboard inertial damping system...
 GEORDI / Dampers on-line... maintanence check in progress... Data, I think we're on to something here... (beat) Let's see what you can do with secondary systems. Try gravitational control...
 DATA / Initiating gravitational --
 GEORDI / Data, what's wrong?
 DATA / There appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net. (beat) I am disconnecting my interface to the computer.
 DATA / Interface deactivated.
 GEORDI / You alright?
 DATA / I have experienced a brief power surge in my positronic subprocessor. (beat) But I am fine.
 GEORDI / Maybe the interface coding is less stable than we thought... (beat) Looks like we've got a few hours of systems analysis before we can try this again.
 GEORDI / Let's check the interface programming...
 WORF / (to Alexander) What are his rights in this century? Will there be a trial... or shall I execute him?
 WORF / To what "old man" do you refer?
 WORF / If your father comes, we will be ready for him.
 TROI / He's right.
 TROI / You're no match for the Hollanders.
 WORF / I am sure the three of us can handle any problems.
 TROI / Hold on. I was just passing through town... saw a little trouble... thought I'd lend a hand... (beat) But I'm not one of your deputies, Sheriff.
 WORF / Counselor... I would appreciate your support in this matter.
 TROI / Durango... (off his look) I'm called Durango.
 WORF / Oh... well... Counselor Durango... perhaps you would consider becoming a temporary deputy?
 TROI / For a price.... (beat) Five hundred dollars.
 WORF / Alexander -- we require large amounts of currency.
 WORF / Deanna... how do you know so much about this period in Earth's history?
 TROI / My father used to read me stories about the Ancient West when I was a little girl. (beat) I must admit... I've always wanted to play the part of the "Mysterious Stranger."
 WORF / Thank you. Ms... ?
 TROI / Sounds delicious.
 WORF / I will not have time this evening. I have a prisoner.
 TROI / (jibing Worf) I'll watch him for you, Sheriff. You two go have a good time.
 WORF / That is very considerate of you. But I would be negligent in my duties if I did not stay. (beat) I am sorry... Ms. Annie.
 WORF / (confused) Who... where?
 PICARD / Computer -- activate Picard Mozart trio, Program One. (beat) Play back tracks one, two and three. Tempo allegro.
 PICARD / (over the din) Computer -- stop playback!
 PICARD / (to computer) Computer -- identify musical composition.
 Beverly is using the space to rehearse the play. RIKER and TWO CREWMEMBERS make up the cast. They are / sitting in a semi-circle, listening to Beverly's direction. Everyone is holding a PADD.
 BEVERLY / Let's read through Act Two. From the beginning...
 RIKER / (reading) "Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature An endothermic quadraped, carnivorous... "
 BEVERLY / Hold it... Wil, what are you reading?
 RIKER / My lines. Why?
 BEVERLY / That's not the right dialogue...
 BEVERLY / (reading) Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses Contribute to your hunting skill and... "
 RIKER / Wait a second... I recognize this... It's Data's poetry.
 BEVERLY / The play's gone. I just keep getting more poetry...
 GEORDI / Well.. the PADDs are functioning normally... (beat) It seems to be a problem with the information retrieval net. For some reason, when you tried to bring up your play, the computer accessed Data's literary files.
 DATA / Geordi, perhaps this problem is related to our interface experiment.
 GEORDI / We'd better run a Level Two diagnostic on the computer. See if the problem has spread to any other systems...
 DATA / And I will perform a self-diagnostic.
 GEORDI / Good idea.
 BEVERLY / You'll let me know if you find the play?
 GEORDI / Yeah... Don't worry, it's in here somewhere.
 DATA_FRANK / (to Alexander) Where's my boy?
 DATA_FRANK / No...
 DATA_FRANK / He's more valuable to us alive.
 DATA / (to replicator) Feline supplement, one hundred twenty-seven.
 DATA / Spot, I have formulated a new mixture of foods specifically tailored to your highly selective tastes.
 DATA / Puzzling. I find it extremely difficult to predict what you will find acceptable. (beat) Perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again.
 DATA / Spot, you are disrupting my ability to work.
 DATA / (Texan accent) You lil' varmint.
 TROI / The most important thing about the quick draw is, you've got to hold your arm loose... like this...
 TROI / Now... you try it.
 WORF / Silence.
 TROI / Worf... Alexander has been gone for over half an hour. Shouldn't he be back by now?
 WORF / Yes... I will go find him. (re: Eli) Watch the prisoner.
 TROI / So, Mister Hollander... I understand you've lived a life of violent crime. (beat) Would you like to discuss your feelings about it?
 WORF / I am looking for my deputy. Perhaps you have seen him.
 WORF / Klingon Firewine.
 DATA_FRANK / (to Worf) Howdy, Sheriff.
 WORF / Commander ... what are you doing here?
 DATA_FRANK / The name is Frank Hollander.
 WORF / (realizing) Oh... I see...
 DATA_FRANK / What are you smiling at?
 WORF / Nothing. Nothing at all... "Mister Hollander." (beat) What is it you want?
 DATA FRANK / My boy.
 WORF / That is not possible. Your son is to stand trial for murder.
 DATA_FRANK / Well then... maybe we can work it out. Is there something you want... in exchange for my boy?
 WORF / You have nothing I want.
 DATA_FRANK / What about... your deputy?
 WORF / What about him?
 WORF / Where is he?
 WORF / I do not negotiate with criminals. (beat) Your son will stand trial.
 DATA_FRANK / Not so fast...
 WORF / Commander... what are you doing?
 DATA_FRANK / I ain't in the mood for games, Sheriff.
 WORF / (uncertain) Data... ?
 WORF / (to computer) Computer -- freeze program.
 DATA_FRANK / Your move, Sheriff.
 DATA_FRANK / (a threat) I wouldn't walk out that door, Sheriff...
 TROI / Worf, what's going on?
 WORF / The Holodeck safeguards are not functioning. Alexander is in danger.
 TROI / (re: wound) My God -- you've been shot.
 TROI / (to computer) Computer -- end program. (taps communicator) Troi to Captain Picard. (beat) Troi to Security.
 WORF / There is a new character in the program -- Hollander's father. He looks like Commander Data...
 TROI / (reacts) Data?
 WORF / But it is not Data... I cannot explain. (beat) I believe he has taken Alexander.
 DATA_ELI (O.S.) / Now ain't that a shame... the poor Sheriff's been injured...
 DATA_ELI / What's wrong... was my pa a little too rough on you?
 TROI / Data... ?
 DATA_ELI / What?
 TROI / (quietly, to Worf) Why would the computer create Holodeck characters that look like Data?
 WORF / (to Data_Eli) Where have they taken my son?
 WORF / (demands) Where is he?
 DATA_ELI / Temper, temper, Sheriff. Pa wouldn't be too pleased if I came back all bruised...
 TROI / Worf, wait...
 TROI / We've got to remember... the Holodeck safeguards may be off, but this is still a program... (beat) If we can get to the end of this story... the way it was designed to play out... the program should automatically terminate.
 WORF / You are right... (beat) I will begin by speaking to the people of this town. Perhaps someone witnessed Alexander's abduction.
 GEORDI / We think our interface experiment may have caused one of the computer's core subroutines to be altered.
 DATA / When the interface malfunction occurred, subroutine C-forty-seven was replaced by elements of my personal programming.
 RIKER / What does C-forty-seven control?
 GEORDI / Library computer access... replicator selection... recreational programming... No critical systems.
 DATA / (to Picard) That would explain why your music composition program began playing "The Slavonic Dances." I have been analyzing the collected works of Anton Dvorak.
 GEORDI / (nods) The same with Doctor Crusher's play... and with the food replicators...
 RIKER / (explains) The replicators on Decks Four through Nine have started producing nothing but cat food.
 PICARD / Cat food?
 DATA / I have been formulating nutritional supplements for Spot.
 PICARD / When can you have the problem corrected?
 DATA / We are currently attempting to isolate the corrupted circuit pathways. (beat) I reckon the process should take less then two hours.
 PICARD / What did you say?
 DATA / I said the process would take less than two hours.
 RIKER / No -- you said "I reckon... "
 DATA / According to my memory log, I did not use those words. (Texan accent) Ya'll must be mistaken.
 GEORDI / There, Data, You did it again.
 DATA / (Texan accent) Did whut?
 PICARD / Mister La Forge -- perhaps you should take Mister Data to Engineering. See if you can find the problem.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 DATA_ELI / Can I help you with somethin?
 WORF / I spoke to several witnesses. One saw Alexander being abducted as he was leaving the bank... by Hollander's men.
 WORF / We will begin a systematic search of the town...
 TROI / Worf... we've got another problem. I saw Eli shuffling his cards. He was doing it the way Data does when he plays poker... (beat) He doesn't just look like Data... he has Data's abilities. And his father probably does, as well...
 DATA_FRANK / Howdy, Sheriff. (beat) I came to see my boy.
 WORF / Remove your weapon.
 DATA_FRANK / (re: gun) Take a good look at that gun, Sheriff... you might see it again real soon.
 DATA_FRANK / Eli?
 DATA_ELI / Pa!
 DATA_FRANK / How have they been treating you, son?
 DATA_ELI / Real bad, Pa. They ain't fed me since I got here... and the Sheriff's been roughin me up somethin fierce.
 DATA_FRANK / Don't you worry. The Sheriff will pay for this.
 DATA_FRANK / (re: Troi) Who's the stranger?
 DATA_ELI / Don't know... she ain't said her name. But she's in cahoots with the Sheriff... and she's mighty mean with a Winchester.
 DATA_FRANK / Sit tight, boy. I'll have you home in time for supper.
 DATA_FRANK / I'll give you one more opportunity to avoid an ugly situation, Sheriff. Release my boy.
 WORF / I have... reconsidered your offer. I will release your son... in exchange for my deputy.
 DATA_FRANK / I thought you might have a change of heart... (beat) Meet me in two hours. You be in front of the saloon... I'll be in front of the livery station.
 WORF / Agreed.
 DATA_FRANK / (to Worf, re; Troi) Strangers ain't invited.
 TROI / In every Western I've ever read, the villains break their word. We can't trust him.
 WORF / But we have made an honorable agreement.
 TROI / They're not concerned with honor, Worf. This is the Ancient West. There's a gunfighter out there who can shoot with the speed and accuracy of an android... (beat) And in two hours, he's going to try to kill you.
 DATA / (to Riker, Texan accent) Howdy, Commander.
 RIKER / Mister La Forge... what have you found?
 DATA / (Texan accent) Well... we figure parts of my memory structure... (normal voice) ... have been replaced with information from the computer's recreational data-base.
 GEORDI / Specifically, files relating to the nineteenth century American West.
 RIKER / That explains the accent...
 DATA / (Texan accent) That's right, partner.
 RIKER / Is this another result of the interface experiment?
 GEORDI / I'm afraid so. But we've initiated a progressive memory purge to restore Data's programming to its original state. (beat) He should be back to normal in a few hours.
 RIKER / What about the computer's recreational data-base?
 GEORDI / We've started a memory purge there, as well. It'll take another hour... maybe two.
 DATA / (Texan accent) You just sit tight, Commander. We'll have it fixed up in time for supper.
 RIKER / Good.
 WORF (O.S.) / I will be positioned here, at the Eastern end of the street...
 WORF (O.S.) / Frank Hollander says he will approach from this end...
 WORF / (re: "x") Once he gets to this point, he will be within range.
 TROI / Understood. (beat) What about Alexander?
 WORF / There is a rain barrel in front of the saloon. It should be enough to stop the bullets.
 WORF / Excellent.
 WORF / (to Annie) Thank you, Ms. Annie. I am... in your debt.
 TROI / How long will the field last?
 WORF / It is highly unstable. No more than fifteen seconds.
 TROI / Let's hope that's enough.
 DATA_FRANK / Eli -- down!
 WORF / (calls out) Alexander!
 DATA_BANDITO (O.S.) / Senor Frank!
 TROI / (to Datas) Don't even think about it.
 DATA_FRANK / Go ahead and shoot me.
 WORF / (to Data_Frank) Do not show your face in this town again.
 WORF / Are you alright?
 WORF / (to computer) Computer -- end program.
 TROI / I don't understand this. The story should be over... what's left?
 DATA_ANNIE (O.S.) / Sheriff... Sheriff!
 DATA_ANNIE / You're as handy with a shootin'-iron as you are with a lady's heart!
 WORF / (to computer) Computer -- end program!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46278.3. Both Commander Data and the ship's computer have been restored to normal operation. Our rendezvous with the supply ship Biko has proceeded as planned.
 WORF / The town of Deadwood may face danger again, Alexander. If they do... they'll need a Sheriff... and a deputy.
 WORF / Commander... is it your intention to continue growing your beard?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure, Worf. Why?
 WORF / I am just asking.
 BEVERLY / Seven-card stud, one-eyed jacks are wild. Frankly, I like your beard, Geordi.
 GEORDI / Thanks, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / The king is high... your bet, Wil.
 BEVERLY / Of course, I'm always a little suspicious of men with beards.
 WORF / For what reason?
 BEVERLY / I don't know... it's as though they're trying to hide something.
 RIKER / Hide -- ? Doctor, that's ridiculous. Beards are a proud and ancient tradition.
 GEORDI / Some of the most esteemed men in history had beards.
 BEVERLY / I know... but after the razor was invented... I think beards became mostly a fashion statement.
 WORF / I am not concerned with fashion. To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol of courage.
 RIKER / I think it suggests a certain... strength.
 BEVERLY / Sure. After all, women can't grow one.
 GEORDI / Doctor, I get the feeling you think beards are nothing more than an affectation.
 BEVERLY / I do. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that... women wear makeup and nail polish for the same reason. (beat) I just think you men should admit it.
 RIKER / My beard isn't an affectation.
 BEVERLY / Oh? Then why not shave it off?
 RIKER / I could lose it in a minute. (beat) I've just gotten used to it.
 BEVERLY / Okay... what do you say we up the stakes a little? If I win this hand... you all shave off your beards.
 GEORDI / What if one of us wins? What do you give up?
 BEVERLY / (shrugs) I'm open to suggestions...
 RIKER / I've always wondered what you'd look like as a brunette...
 BEVERLY / I tried it once when I was thirteen. I couldn't wait to change it back.
 RIKER / That makes me even more curious...
 BEVERLY / Fine. If one of you wins -- I become a brunette. Are we on?
 GEORDI / We'll take that bet.
 RIKER / (are you sure?) Geordi...
 BEVERLY / Sounds like you have the hand to beat, Commander. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / (tossing out chips) I'm in for two hundred.
 GEORDI / I'll see that and raise two hundred.
 BEVERLY / Call.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / This is the Captain. We have arrived at the Tyran system. All senior staff to the Bridge.
 BEVERLY / Wait --
 RIKER / Sorry, Doctor, you heard the Captain. Duty calls.
 RIKER / I'm sure we can try this another time.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, stardate 46307.2. We have just come into orbit of Tyrus-Seven-A to monitor progress on the Tyran particle fountain, a radically new mining technology.
 PICARD (V.O.) / So far the project has been fraught with problems, and is well behind schedule. Mister La Forge has been assigned to evaluate the situation.
 GEORDI is standing with the project leader, DOCTOR / FARALLON. She's an attractive humanoid alien woman about the same age as Geordi. They're discussing an Okudagram of the particle fountain displayed on a wall monitor. From the tone of Geordi's voice, it's clear this isn't the first disagreement they've had.
 GEORDI / (patiently) Doctor Farallon. The original design called for the particle fountain to lift five-hundred kilograms per minute from the surface -- so far it hasn't come close to that.
 GEORDI / Yeah... and overload the field generators in the process.
 GEORDI / Doctor... forgive me... but maybe we should concentrate on getting this phase of the project completed... before we start talking about re-designing it...
 GEORDI / (acknowledging) Starfleet is considering whether to use a particle fountain on Carema Three... they want to know how feasible it is.
 GEORDI / Not really... I'll make my report to Captain Picard... he'll make the official recommendation to Starfleet... and they'll decide.
 GEORDI / I guess the question we have to ask... is if this technology is any more efficient than conventional mining techniques.
 GEORDI / I agree that potentially it's very exciting...
 DATA sits at the Aft Science station, studying the / monitor with concern. WORF is at Tactical.
 DATA / Enterprise to Commander La Forge. I am reading significant power fluctuations from the station core. Please report.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here... there's been a malfunction in one of the power grids...
 GEORDI / (to COM) ... we're losing particle stream confinement.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Do you require assistance?
 GEORDI / Stand by.
 GEORDI / I think we're going to have to shut it down.
 GEORDI / We have less than five minutes before we lose confinement. When that happens, the particle stream will flood the entire station, and then we'll have to shut it down anyway.
 GEORDI / How do we do that? (gesturing to a console) The defective grid is two hundred meters down conduit A-Four. We'd have to disassemble four bulkheads to get to it...
 GEORDI / What is it?
 DATA / Enterprise to La Forge... what is your situation?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Unchanged for the moment... but we're working on it...
 GEORDI / If this doesn't work pretty soon, I recommend you shut down...
 GEORDI / (off console) The confinement field is at full strength... particle flux steady... all power levels normal.
 DATA / Commander La Forge, please report.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / We're fine, Data. The power grid has been fully restored.
 DATA / How were you able to accomplish the repair so quickly?
 GEORDI / You know... I'm not exactly sure.
 DATA / Energize.
 DATA / Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor. I am Lieutenant Commander Data.
 DATA / And I have studied your design for the particle fountain, Doctor. I find the concept to be highly innovative.
 DATA / I am curious how you were able to repair the power grid so quickly.
 GEORDI / We can set up in Engineering.
 DATA / Actually, that is no longer the case. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / I recently converted my main interlink sequencer to asynchronous operation, which removed that performance constraint.
 GEORDI / Doctor, this way please...
 DATA / The interlink sequencer is now bi-directional. It compensates for...
 GEORDI / (impressed) Boridium power converter... axionic chip network... very sophisticated. (glancing at Data) In terms of sheer computational speed, this little guy could almost compete with you, Data.
 DATA / "Exocomps... ?"
 DATA / The correct procedure would be to adjust the converter.
 DATA / A mode stabilizer.
 GEORDI / A mode stabilizer. Very nice.
 DATA / You have incorporated a micro-replication system into the device... in order to fashion tools.
 DATA / So... in a sense, they are "learning."
 GEORDI / Well, it's impressive technology, no doubt about it. Once it's out of the experimental stage there'll be plenty of applications --
 GEORDI / At sixteen hundred hours.
 PICARD / The Enterprise is scheduled to leave the Tyran System tomorrow. If I'm to change that plan, I'll need a good reason.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 PICARD / I understand one of these devices successfully repaired the faulty power grid...
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, what are your thoughts?
 GEORDI / I guess the only risk... is falling even further behind.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / The exocomps are highly sophisticated devices, sir. If they perform to expectations, their potential to advance this project is considerable.
 PICARD / I'm inclined to agree. I don't think forty-eight hours is too much time to risk -- particularly when the gains might be substantial. (beat) You may proceed, Doctor.
 DATA / Thank you, Doctor. I would welcome the opportunity.
 DATA / I agree, Doctor.
 DATA / I have successfully completed fourteen separate tasks with this exocomp in the past hour. I estimate it would have taken two people nine hours to accomplish the same tasks. I would characterize the unit's performance as excellent.
 DATA / I am confident that they will. Commander La Forge is an excellent --
 DATA / It is not accepting my commands.
 DATA / Doctor --
 GEORDI / Let's see what our computer has to say...
 DATA / The interface circuitry which links the exocomp to the control padd has been completely burned out.
 GEORDI / That's strange... is there any evidence of secondary power surges?
 DATA / No.
 GEORDI / But what's going on there... ? Data, increase magnification in section Gamma-Four.
 DATA / Interesting... the number of circuit pathways within the exocomp has increased by six-hundred thirty-two percent.
 GEORDI / What is it?
 DATA / Doctor... the new pathways do not appear to be interfering with the original circuitry --
 GEORDI / That leaves you with only two of them... it's going to slow you down...
 GEORDI / I just wanted to say that we'll be happy to add an extra shift to take up the slack...
 GEORDI / It's okay... you've got a lot on your shoulders.
 GEORDI / I feel sorry for her. This project has had nothing but problems. (beat) Why did that plasma conduit explode?
 DATA / Apparently there was a micro-fracture in the conduit wall. The fault did not register on our instruments.
 GEORDI / (offhand, joking) I guess it's a good thing the exocomp malfunctioned... almost seems like it knew just when to leave.
 DATA / Geordi, are you implying that the exocomp was exhibiting a form of self-preservation?
 GEORDI / (surprised) Of course not.
 GEORDI / On my way.
 DATA / Computer... perform a level one diagnostic on the exocomp's command module.
 DATA / How can that be... if the interface circuitry is burned out?
 DATA / Curious...
 DATA / Computer, access the exocomp's sensor logs and confirm that there was a failure of the interface circuitry within the last twelve hours.
 DATA / How... and when... was it repaired?
 DATA / Why would the exocomp burn out its own interface circuitry... and then repair it two hours later?
 GEORDI / There you are... I thought you'd be hard at work by now.
 GEORDI / I came to tell you I've assigned two engineering teams to work on the particle fountain.
 GEORDI / I really admire the work you've done. And I'm sorry if the exocomps aren't working out...
 GEORDI / I'll bet you were the kind of little girl who was always climbing one branch higher than the other kids...
 GEORDI / ... and I bet you never fell.
 GEORDI / (grinning) Well, if it comes down to sheer determination -- you'll get that particle fountain built.
 BEVERLY and WORF are dressed in loose workout uniforms. / Beverly is sitting on a sickbed; there is a bruise on her forearm. An ND NURSE administers to her with a TECH device. WORF stands near the bed, lecturing Beverly patiently. Beverly seems more excited than hurt.
 WORF / Doctor, if you wish to master the bat'telh sword, you must learn to strike and avoid in the same motion.
 BEVERLY / I almost got in under your guard, Worf.
 WORF / Almost.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) OK... I'll try to keep that in mind for my next lesson.
 BEVERLY / Thanks.
 DATA / Doctor, are you injured?
 BEVERLY / Just my pride, Data. (beat) What can I do for you?
 DATA / I would like to ask you a question. What is your definition of life?
 BEVERLY / That's a big question, Data. Why are you asking?
 DATA / I am searching for a definition which will allow me to test an hypothesis.
 BEVERLY / Well, the broadest scientific definition might be... that life is what enables plants and animals to consume food... derive energy from it, grow, adapt themselves to their surroundings... and reproduce.
 DATA / And you would suggest that anything which exhibits those characteristics would be considered alive?
 BEVERLY / In general, yes.
 DATA / What about fire?
 BEVERLY / Fire?
 DATA / Yes. It consumes fuel to produce energy... it grows... it creates offspring... by your definition, is it alive?
 BEVERLY / Fire is a chemical reaction. You could make the same argument for growing crystals... but obviously, we don't consider them alive.
 DATA / And what about me? I do not grow... I do not reproduce... and yet I am considered to be alive.
 BEVERLY / That's true. But then you're unique.
 DATA / I wonder if that is so...
 BEVERLY / Data, if I may ask... just what is it you're getting at?
 DATA / (beat) I am curious... as to what transpired between one moment when I was nothing more than an assemblage of parts in Doctor Soong's laboratory... and the next moment when I became "alive." What was it that endowed me with life?
 BEVERLY / I remember Wesley asking me a similar question when he was little. I tried desperately to give him an answer... but everything I said sounded inadequate.
 BEVERLY / Then I realized that scientists and philosophers had been grappling with the same question for centuries... without coming to any conclusion.
 DATA / Are you saying that the question can never be answered?
 BEVERLY / No... I think I'm saying that we struggle all our lives to answer it... and it's the struggle that's important. That's what helps us define our place in the universe.
 DATA / I think I understand, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / I don't feel like I've helped you very much...
 DATA / On the contrary, Doctor -- you have helped a great deal. Thank you.
 GEORDI / Okay. I've split the engineering teams among all the shifts. If nothing else goes wrong, that should be enough to help you finish on time.
 GEORDI / (beat, joking) Do you think they'll toe the line... ?
 DATA / Doctor, please... I must ask you to stop using the exocomps.
 DATA / No. It is not that.
 DATA / I have reason to believe that the exocomps are alive.
 PICARD / Doctor, I appreciate the time constraints you're under. But recognizing new life -- whatever its form -- is the principal mission of this vessel. (beat) Mister Data, what makes you think the exocomps could be alive?
 DATA / Sir, when the exocomp left the access tunnel prior to the explosion, I believe it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction.
 DATA / I believe so. When you attempted to override the exocomp and send it back into the tunnel, it responded by deliberately burning out its control interface.
 BEVERLY / Deliberately?
 DATA / The computer diagnostic showed that the exocomp disabled its own interface.
 DATA / However, two hours later, when the exocomp was aboard the Enterprise and no longer in danger... it repaired itself.
 DATA / I believe that the exocomp was protecting itself. And if that is true, it has demonstrated an awareness of its environment -- and an ability to adapt to that environment.
 TROI / (gently) Doctor, why is it so difficult for you to accept the fact that the exocomp could be alive? (re: Data) After all, you're talking to a living machine right now.
 DATA / There is a big difference between a humanoid and a virus, Doctor. But both are alive.
 PICARD / If the possibility exists... no matter how slight... that the exocomps are lifeforms, then we must examine that possibility.
 DATA / Thank you, sir. And until we have a definitive answer, I believe that it is inappropriate to exploit the exocomps as laborers.
 BEVERLY / If they are intelligent life forms, we have no right to force them to work for us.
 BEVERLY / Tricorders aren't alive...
 PICARD / Clearly these are difficult issues to resolve. We must proceed carefully. The first task is to test Mister Data's hypothesis.
 GEORDI / Data, you're claiming that this exocomp may be alive because it demonstrated a survival instinct, right?
 DATA / Yes.
 GEORDI / So why don't we just threaten its survival again and see what happens?
 GEORDI / We're almost ready, Doctor. You can start programming it.
 GEORDI / What we've done is to recreate a situation similar to the one the exocomp encountered in the plasma conduit.
 DATA / We have created a small conduit breach in this tube. The exocomp would normally require several minutes to complete this type of repair. However, once it enters the tube, it will find that a plasma cascade failure is in progress.
 PICARD / I assume that is only a simulation...
 GEORDI / Yes, sir. We're running a transient overload signal that will simulate a failure in exactly one minute.
 PICARD / Very well. Proceed.
 GEORDI / I'm beginning the test sequence now.
 GEORDI / One minute.
 GEORDI / Fifty seconds...
 GEORDI / ... thirty seconds...
 GEORDI / ... ten seconds...
 GEORDI / ...five... four... three... two... one... (beat) That's it. If this had been for real, the tube would've exploded... with the exocomp inside.
 GEORDI / Go ahead and bring it back, Doctor.
 DATA / Thank you for your help, Doctor.
 PICARD / You may rest assured that I consider this time well spent.
 DATA / As do I, sir. Thank you.
 BEVERLY / Commander Riker said you were still down here. (beat) He also said the exocomp failed the test.
 DATA / That is true.
 DATA / I have completed thirty-four additional trials, and the results have been the same in each of them. (beat) Perhaps I was wrong in suspecting the exocomp was alive.
 BEVERLY / (beat) This was important to you, wasn't it?
 DATA / You said earlier that I am unique. If so, that means I am alone in the universe. As I investigated the exocomps, I realized that I might be encountering a progenitor of myself. Suddenly the possibility existed that I was no longer alone. (beat) For that reason, it was --
 DATA / The exocomp has returned...
 BEVERLY / Isn't that what it's supposed to do?
 DATA / In the previous thirty-four trials, I brought it back once the simulated failure occurred. This time, we were talking, and I neglected to do that.
 BEVERLY / I distracted you. I'm sorry.
 DATA / Do not apologize, Doctor. I believe we have discovered something significant.
 BEVERLY / What?
 DATA / The exocomp has replicated a different tool... that is not the molecular fuser it had when it entered the Jeffries tube.
 DATA / Doctor... the exocomp not only completed the repairs... it also deactivated the overload signal.
 BEVERLY / I thought that was just a simulation.
 DATA / It was. And the exocomp must have realized that. It saw there was no real danger... and completed the repairs...
 BEVERLY / ... and then replicated the correct tool to eliminate the false overload signal.
 DATA / I see no other possible explanation.
 BEVERLY / The exocomp didn't fail the test -- it saw right through it.
 GEORDI / It looks like there's still some difficulty with the phase selectors...
 PICARD / For the sake of the project, I hope you're right.
 GEORDI / (checks console) Maybe it's another power grid malfunction?
 GEORDI / (urgently) Captain, a radiation field is going to flood this chamber. If we don't get everybody out of here immediately...
 PICARD / Understood. Doctor, we are evacuating this station.
 PICARD / That is an order, Doctor. Assemble all personnel on the Transporter pad, now!
 PICARD / Picard to Enterprise...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (heavy static) ... ard to Ent...
 RIKER / Riker here, sir.
 WORF / The radiation field is increasing, sir. We are losing communications.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / (heavily static) Ent... pare for trans...
 RIKER / Red alert.
 RIKER / Riker to Transporter Room Two. Prepare for emergency transport.
 GEORDI / The radiation is setting up a field ionization effect, sir. We've got less than a minute to beam out.
 PICARD / Is this everybody?
 GEORDI / (quickly, to Picard) I'll get him, sir.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge!
 PICARD / Stand by to transport.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge... Mister La Forge!
 PICARD / Geordi, are you all right?
 GEORDI / I'm okay... I only caught the edge of it...
 GEORDI / He's dead, sir.
 RIKER / Chief, do you have them?
 RIKER / Is everyone all right?
 RIKER / Kelso, can you get them off?
 DATA / (off console) Commander, the particle fountain is continuing to surge. At the present rate, the radiation within the station core will reach fatal levels in twenty-three minutes.
 GEORDI / Captain, if I can access the field emitters, we should be able to establish a force field... see if you can link your console to my command system sub-routine.
 PICARD / All right...
 PICARD / Link established.
 GEORDI / Okay, here goes...
 PICARD / I'm reading power fluctuations... the field's not stable...
 GEORDI / Yeah... the radiation levels are too high... the emitters are beginning to deteriorate...
 PICARD / How long can we expect this force field to last?
 GEORDI / Not very long...
 PICARD / We have to keep it up long enough to give Commander Riker the time he needs to get to us...
 GEORDI / Maybe we can help him out... see if you can access the emergency shut-down routine... I'll try to activate the ionic dampers.
 DATA / A force field was activated on the station a few moments ago. It is possible that Commander La Forge has established a low-intensity deflector field.
 RIKER / It won't last long in that radiation...
 DATA / No, sir. My readings indicate that it will fail in approximately twenty-two minutes.
 RIKER / All right, we've got twenty-two minutes. I want some options.
 WORF / Can we send a shuttlecraft to evacuate them?
 RIKER / Then we'll have to find a way to shut down the particle fountain.
 RIKER / (continuing) What if we detonated a low-yield photon torpedo within the particle stream? Wouldn't that shut it down?
 RIKER / How long would it take to set up?
 DATA / I estimate that it would take a minimum of sixty-five minutes to properly configure the torpedo.
 RIKER / We don't have that much time.
 DATA / Commander. I must object to this plan.
 RIKER / Data, we've been through this already. We tested the exocomp... and it failed.
 DATA / Sir, Doctor Crusher and I discovered that the exocomp did not fail the test. It is still my belief that we are dealing with a new life form --
 RIKER / (urgently) Data, you know how much I value your judgment. But I can't risk the Captain and Geordi on the basis of your "belief". (to Farallon) Doctor... prepare the exocomps.
 DATA / Commander, if I am correct, the exocomps will not allow themselves to be destroyed. They have a sense of survival, and will shut down before they will comply with the order.
 RIKER / Do it.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, target two hundred meters below the apex of the particle stream and feed the coordinates to Transporter Room Two.
 WORF / Aye, sir. (works console) Coordinates received.
 RIKER / Mister Kelso... Energize.
 RIKER / Mister Kelso?
 RIKER / (quickly) Run a diagnostic immediately. Try bypassing the --
 DATA / Commander, that will not be necessary. The Transporter is not malfunctioning. I have locked out the controls.
 RIKER / Mister Data, I gave you a direct order. Release the Transporter lock-out. Now.
 DATA / I cannot do that, sir.
 RIKER / If you don't, I'll relieve you of duty.
 DATA / That is your prerogative, sir. Under Starfleet regulations, direct insubordination is a court martial offense. (beat) But I cannot release the Transporter.
 RIKER / Data, those are two of your friends out there. They've saved your life more times than I can remember. I can't believe you'd be willing to sacrifice them like this.
 DATA / Commander, please do not think I have made an arbitrary decision. I have considered the ramifications of my actions carefully. And I do not believe it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another.
 RIKER / But you don't know that the exocomps are life forms...
 DATA / It is true that I am acting on a personal belief. But I do not see how I can do otherwise.
 RIKER / You're risking a lot on the basis of a belief...
 DATA / I have observed that humans often base their judgments on nothing more than what is referred to as "intuition" or "instinct." Because I am a machine, I lack that particular ability. However... it is possible that I may have an insight into other machines that humans lack.
 RIKER / If there were a way to save the Captain and Geordi without destroying the exocomps, I'd jump at it. But I'm running out of time... and this is the only solution I've got.
 DATA / Then let me offer an alternative. If you transport me to the station, I will try to complete a manual shut down of the particle stream.
 RIKER / The radiation levels are too high, even for you. Your positronic net would be ionized within minutes. I can't let you sacrifice yourself.
 DATA / If I give up my life to save my fellow officers, that is my choice. The exocomps no longer have that choice.
 RIKER / Then... what if we re-connect their command pathways and give them a choice?
 DATA / A choice, sir?
 RIKER / Data, you've assumed the exocomps will shut themselves down before undertaking this mission... at least, we can ask them if they're willing to proceed.
 DATA / That seems reasonable, sir... if they choose to go, I would be willing to release the Transporter lock-out.
 RIKER / Fair enough...
 DATA / If the exocomps do not shut down after I have programmed them, we may assume that they are willing to go.
 RIKER / What does that mean? Are they willing to go or not?
 DATA / They seem to be re-programming the commands I entered...
 RIKER / Re-programming them... ?
 DATA / Clearly, they are not willing to be transported into the stream for detonation... however, they may have an alternate solution.
 DATA / Not at all... but they do have superior experience, Doctor... during their service, they have interfaced with every part of the station core... something none of us has done, including yourself. They may have another way to control the particle surge.
 RIKER / Kelso -- energize.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge...
 GEORDI / What are they up to?
 GEORDI / Those look like power-taps of some kind...
 PICARD / That's exactly what they are... the exocomps are siphoning off power from the core...
 GEORDI / They're trying to distort the particle stream frequency. That might open up a window that the Enterprise can use to beam us out...
 GEORDI / If they can modulate the radiation field... it'll work. But they'll have to get the sub-harmonic frequencies to resonance...
 GEORDI / The particle stream frequency is fluctuating... they're having trouble controlling the feedback... it may be more power than they can handle...
 PICARD / Can we help them? Is there any way we can moderate the power transfer?
 GEORDI / We've done all we can, sir... it's up to them now.
 GEORDI / This is incredible... they're balancing the power absorption rates... (beat) It's working... the particle stream is beginning to distort... (beat) Almost at resonance... (beat) They've got it.
 PICARD / Drop the force field.
 RIKER / Energize --
 DATA / (to Kelso) Can you lock on to the exocomps?
 GEORDI / One of them had to continue disrupting the particle stream... absorbing that much power would prevent a signal lock...
 DATA / It was the only way to save the other two.
 DATA / Thank you, Doctor. (beat) I wish your work on the particle fountain had been more successful... perhaps the exocomps will be able to help you to re-construct it.
 PICARD / I'll look forward to it.
 PICARD / Something more, Mister Data?
 DATA / Yes, sir. I thought you might be curious why I would be willing to risk your life for several small machines.
 PICARD / I think I understand the predicament you were in. It cannot have been an easy choice.
 DATA / No, sir. It was not. Several years ago, when my status as a living being was in question, you fought to protect my rights -- and for that, I will always be grateful. (beat) The exocomps had no such advocate, sir. If I had not acted in their behalf, they would have been destroyed. I could not allow that to happen.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 46357.4 We have rendezvoused with the starship Cairo near the Cardassian border for an urgent meeting with Vice-Admiral Nechayev.
 PICARD is just removing a cup of tea from the / replicator. The door CHIMES.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER and ADMIRAL NECHAYEV ENTER. Nechayev is a tall / graceful woman in her late fifties, with a dark complexion. She charges into the room, her every movement emphasizing urgency.
 RIKER / (to Nechayev) Admiral, may I present Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard, Admiral.
 PICARD / (warm, to Nechayev) May I offer you some tea or --
 RIKER / Are the Cardassians really ready for war?
 TROI / Will we?
 RIKER / Where is Captain Picard?
 DATA / He is the commanding officer of the Cairo.
 RIKER / I've heard of him. But I don't think any of us have ever --
 RIKER / Admiral...
 RIKER / With all due respect... it isn't necessary to give Captain Jellico command of the Enterprise in order to conduct a negotiation.
 BEVERLY and WORF are running down a dark tunnel. They / are each wearing black jumpsuits, with backpacks and they're both smudged and dirty. They round a corner and stop. Worf looks back down the tunnel while Beverly quickly pulls a DEVICE out of her pack and sets it on the ground. Worf FIRES a blast down the tunnel into the darkness as Beverly activates the unit and a FORCEFIELD FLASHES into effect, covering the width of the tunnel.
 PICARD'S VOICE / (o.c.) Freeze program.
 PICARD / You were at least five seconds slower this time.
 WORF / You increased the difficulty level, sir.
 PICARD / It'll be a lot more difficult where we're going.
 BEVERLY / Which is where, exactly?
 PICARD / I'm sorry, but I can't tell you that yet.
 WORF / Captain... it would be helpful to know something about our mission.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... I have my orders. I'm sure you understand.
 PICARD / (re: device) Now... this deflector isn't set properly. You have to position the emitter array so that it blocks the entire passageway or it's useless.
 BEVERLY / Sorry. I guess I was paying too much attention to getting away from that last Cardassian. Or maybe it was the phaser blasts... or the falling rocks...
 PICARD / I know this is difficult. But for now, all I can do is ask you to trust me.
 BEVERLY / All right. Let's do it again.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, time Doctor Crusher and me through the first tunnel. (with a smile) We'll pick up those five seconds this time.
 RIKER / Welcome aboard the Enterprise, sir. I'm Commander --
 RIKER / (a little taken aback) Thank you, sir. So am I.
 RIKER / Well... yes, sir.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / We're on a standard three shift rotation.
 RIKER / Uh... Wil, sir.
 RIKER / We've assigned you to cabin seven three five. That's up on deck --
 RIKER / (to group) Attention to orders.
 PICARD / (to group) To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise. Stardate 46358. You are hereby requested and required to relinquish command of your vessel to Captain Edward Jellico, Commanding Officer, USS Cairo as of this date. Signed, Vice-Admiral Alynna Nechayev, Starfleet Command.
 PICARD / (to com) Computer, transfer all command codes to Captain Edward Jellico. Voice authorization: Picard-delta-five.
 PICARD / I stand relieved.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) I wonder how permanent this is going to be.
 RIKER / I don't know... but they don't usually go through the ceremony if it's just a temporary assignment.
 TROI / Sore?
 BEVERLY / Sore doesn't begin to describe it.
 BEVERLY / I know. I wish I could talk about it.
 PICARD / Most of the secondary systems were replaced during our last overhaul. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / I don't think they'll give you any problems. But you might want to check on the port lateral --
 PICARD / (quiet) It's going well. But I would prefer more current intelligence on the exact lay-out of the installation. The most recent information is over two years old.
 PICARD / (wry) She didn't give me a choice.
 PICARD / That would be extremely helpful.
 RIKER / (to each of them) Captain... Captain...
 RIKER / I actually wanted to talk to you about delta a little later, sir. Right now, gamma shift is still slated to be on duty when we arrive and I'll be sure to tell Lieutenant McDowell about the probe.
 RIKER / Well, there is no delta shift yet, sir. I spoke to the department heads about changing from three to four shifts, and it's going to create some significant personnel problems for us.
 RIKER / No, sir. I wanted to talk to you about this when we had a chance so that --
 RIKER / Yes, sir. (beat) If you'll excuse me, sir. (to Picard) Captain.
 PICARD / And one of the finest officers I've ever served with.
 DATA / The transfer interface is not designed for that configuration. It will take seven hours to make the changes.
 RIKER / Sir... you may not be aware that our normal interface already routes auxiliary power through three separate relays.
 RIKER / I'll get right on it, sir.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 DATA / We will arrive in fifty-two hours, thirty-one minutes, sir.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / Really?
 GEORDI / (listens) I don't hear anything.
 GEORDI / I'll check it, sir.
 GEORDI / The coil efficiency is well within specifications, Captain.
 GEORDI / (shocked) Fifteen percent?
 DATA / That is an attainable goal. But it will require realigning the warp coil and taking the secondary distribution grid off-line.
 GEORDI / Taking that grid off-line will shut down the astrophysics lab, exobiology, geological research --
 DATA / I believe that is also an attainable goal. If we utilize the entire Engineering department, there should be sufficient manpower available to complete the task.
 GEORDI / Sure, if they work around the clock for the next two days.
 GEORDI / (tight) Yes, sir.
 TROI / May I speak with you, Captain?
 TROI / (looks) Definitely an elephant.
 TROI / I'd be happy to. (beat) But first, I'd like to talk about the way the change in command is affecting the crew.
 TROI / I wouldn't call it resistance. More like... uncertainty. Most of them have served under Captain Picard for several years. They knew him, knew what he expected. Now they're being asked to adjust to a new captain and a new way of doing things. They're uncertain how to react.
 TROI / And to you. Perhaps everyone just needs some time... time for you to get to know and trust the crew... and time for them to understand how you want things done.
 TROI / Of course, sir.
 GEORDI / (frustrated) Commander, he's asking me to completely reroute half the power systems on the ship, change every duty roster, realign the warp coils in two days, and now he's transferred a third of my department to Security.
 RIKER / If it makes you feel any better, you're not alone. Captain Jellico is making major changes in every department on the ship.
 GEORDI / I don't mind making changes and I don't mind hard work. But he's not giving me the time to do the work. Someone's got to make him listen to reason.
 RIKER / He's not going to listen to me. I think he's made that abundantly clear.
 GEORDI / Then can I make a suggestion? Talk to Captain Picard. Maybe he can do something.
 GEORDI / We just need a little time, Commander, that's all.
 RIKER / (beat) All right.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Are you all right, sir?
 PICARD / Oh, yes. (smiles) The last time I had to train like this was for the Academy marathon, but I'm managing.
 PICARD / What can I do for you?
 RIKER / It's... nothing urgent. I'm sorry to bother you. Good night, sir.
 PICARD / My orders are to maintain radio silence until we've completed the mission.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Jellico. We've arrived at the shuttle departure coordinates.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir. I wasn't aware that you wanted to be informed...
 PICARD / Captain... I just want you to know that Commander Riker is--
 PICARD / It's not simply my opinion. He's been decorated five times by Starfleet Command and offered his own ship on more than one occasion. I think if you give him a chance, you'll find he's an outstanding officer.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 WORF / (to com) Shuttlecraft Feynman to Enterprise. We have cleared the shuttlebay.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged, Feynman. Good luck.
 PICARD / (to com) Thank you, Enterprise.
 PICARD / Now that we're on our way... I can finally tell you about our mission.
 PICARD / Starfleet Intelligence believes the Cardassians are developing... metagenic weapons.
 BEVERLY / (quiet, grim) Oh my God.
 WORF / I am not familiar with... metagenics.
 BEVERLY / They're genetically engineered viruses which are designed to destroy entire eco-systems. The metagenic toxins are released into the atmosphere of a planet and immediately begin mutating. They seek out and destroy every form of DNA they encounter. (beat) In a few days, everything is dead.
 PICARD / Within a month, the metagenic agent itself breaks down and dissipates completely... leaving every city, road, and piece of equipment perfectly intact.
 WORF / Leaving the planet safe to be conquered. (beat) Wouldn't using such a weapon pose as great a risk to the attacker as it does to the target?
 BEVERLY / That's why metagenics and other biological weapons were outlawed years ago. Even the Romulans abide by those agreements.
 PICARD / Starfleet Intelligence believes that the Cardassians are developing a new delivery system -- one which would protect them from any accidental exposure to the toxin. (beat) They believe the Cardassians are testing a way of launching dormant metagenic material on a subspace carrier wave.
 BEVERLY / So they could activate the toxin after launch... that would protect them from accidental exposure.
 PICARD / (nods) And because the subspace wave would appear to be simple background radiation... no one would realize what was happening until it was too late.
 PICARD / For several weeks, bursts of thetaband subspace emissions have been detected coming from Celtris Three. Those emissions may indicate a metagenic delivery system in operation.
 WORF / What do we know about Celtris Three?
 PICARD / Very little. It was thought to be uninhabited until these emissions were detected. Starfleet believes there is a secret research lab located somewhere beneath the surface. (beat) Our orders are to penetrate the Celtris Three installation and determine whether or not the Cardassians are actually building a metagenic weapon.
 BEVERLY / And if they are?
 PICARD / Then we destroy it. At all costs.
 PICARD / When I was on the Stargazer, we conducted extensive tests using theta-band carrier waves. One of the reasons I was selected for this mission is my familiarity with the methods used to generate them. Mister Worf, you're along for obvious reasons. Doctor, your job will be to locate and destroy any bio-toxins we find.
 WORF / Celtris Three is in Cardassian space. How will we get there undetected?
 PICARD / I know where we can arrange some... discreet transportation. (beat) Set course for Torman Five.
 PICARD / We're not accusing you of anything.
 PICARD / We're looking for Daimon Solok.
 PICARD / I have a... business proposition to discuss.
 PICARD / Good. Please tell... Daimon Solok that we're interested in arranging some transportation... to Celtris Three.
 PICARD / Yes. I understand that Solok runs... "cargo" there from time to time.
 PICARD / Well, if Solok were going to Celtris for what I'm sure are... legitimate reasons... we would be interested in quietly booking passage for the journey.
 BEVERLY / (seductive) You know... I've heard that Solok is... quite a man...
 BEVERLY / That's why we came here... because only Solok could help us... but I guess there are some things even Solok can't do.
 BEVERLY / (softly) It's too bad... if he had been able to help, I would've been very... very...
 BEVERLY / (whispers in his ear) Grateful.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's Log: Supplemental. We have rendezvoused with the Cardassian ship Reklar to begin diplomatic talks designed to ease tensions along the border.
 RIKER / Gul Lemec has arrived. He's waiting for you in the Observation Lounge.
 TROI / Captain... I think there's been a slight miscommunication. (beat) Did you want to meet with Gul Lemec in here?
 TROI / (puzzled) I see...
 TROI / You're trying to establish a dominant role for yourself by making him wait for you.
 TROI / I see. (beat) The trouble with wolves is that sometimes the fight for dominance ends with one of them dead.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Be certain your tricorder makes a precise map of our route. It will be easy to get lost in here.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) I'm picking up some type of subspace signals, but I can't get a lock on them.
 PICARD / That's characteristic of thetaband emissions. You need to compress the detection band-width to get a directional fix.
 PICARD / The emission source is five hundred meters east of here... and about seven hundred meters below.
 PICARD / It's all right. (re: ceiling) They're called lynars... a kind of Celtran bat. They're harmless.
 WORF / (looking up) Bats...
 BEVERLY / You're not afraid of bats, are you, Worf?
 WORF / Of course not.
 BEVERLY / The bottom's a little over five hundred meters.
 PICARD / There doesn't appear to be any other way down.
 PICARD / This is sheer granite. We'll have to use fusing pitons.
 BEVERLY / We could try to find another way down.
 PICARD / Unfortunately, that could take several hours.
 WORF / (quiet) You're not afraid of heights, are you, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / (ironic) Of course not.
 PICARD / (over above action) Now, remember to control your descent... and don't tangle the lines.
 BEVERLY / Don't tangle the lines... I'll remember.
 PICARD / Ready?
 DATA / Captain on the Bridge.
 TROI / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Well, I'll say this for him... he's very sure of himself.
 TROI / (quiet) No... he's not.
 PICARD / The installation should be about... three hundred meters... (points down one of the tunnels) This way.
 BEVERLY / I don't suppose we're going to find another way to get back up there...
 WORF / Doubtful.
 BEVERLY / That's what I thought.
 PICARD / We need to get through here. This lava tube runs southwest for seventy meters before running into another chamber. (looks inside) The tube opens up a little more beyond this entrance. If we can widen the opening, we should be able to crawl through.
 WORF / A phaser set to level sixteen should suffice.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 PICARD / Very good, Mister Worf.
 TROI / Captain, please... we should listen to them.
 RIKER / Gul Lemec, I'm sure you know that those systems are still subject to negotiation by the terms of the treaty.
 RIKER / The Federation won't start a war.
 PICARD / (to others) Just a few more meters...
 PICARD / (urgent) Beverly, get out of there!
 PICARD / Beverly!
 WORF / Doctor Crusher!
 WORF / No, sir.
 WORF'S VOICE / (o.c.) I have her.
 PICARD / Are you all right?
 BEVERLY / (coughing) I think so. (beat) Next time, you bring up the rear.
 PICARD / We're nearly there. Do you feel like you can continue?
 PICARD / (off tricorder, sotto) This looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation. (beat) I'm picking up three proximity sensors around it.
 WORF / The sensor echo has been established. The false image will only last a few minutes.
 WORF / The hatch is magnetically sealed. But I believe I can bypass it.
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) I can't scan the other side of the hatch... it's been shielded.
 PICARD / We have no choice. (beat, then quiet, to Beverly) Remember: aim low and fire in short, controlled bursts.
 WORF / Ready.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Now.
 PICARD / (quick realization) It's a trap. Come on.
 WORF / Captain!
 WORF / The Captain...
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) There are five more heading this way from another tunnel. Come on.
 DATA / Captain on the Bridge.
 RIKER / (indicates monitor) I'm not sure. We're picking up a lot of coded messages from a Cardassian planet near the border.
 RIKER / Celtris Three.
 RIKER / There're some residual traces... it looks like there were emissions up until a few minutes ago.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / What do you want?
 PICARD / All right... so you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here. Why?
 PICARD / La Barre, France...
 PICARD / Yvette Gessard...
 PICARD / Special operations on Celtris Three.
 PICARD / To seek and destroy a metagenic weapon.
 PICARD / Two.
 PICARD / Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher. Lieutenant Worf.
 PICARD / I don't know.
 PICARD / Picard, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / La Barre, France...
 RIKER / Is he alive?
 RIKER / Is there any truth to what he's saying?
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 TROI / If Captain Picard has been captured... the Cardassians will not hesitate to use any means available to obtain information from him... including torture.
 TROI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I demand to see a neutral representative... as required by the Federation-Cardassian peace treaty.
 PICARD / I can't imagine what information I have that would be meaningful to you.
 PICARD / I know that the burial vaults of the First Hebitian civilization are said to be magnificent.
 PICARD / What happened to them?
 PICARD / That war cost you hundreds of thousands of lives... depleted your food supplies... left your population weakened and miserable... and yet you risk war again.
 PICARD / And yet there seems to be enough to maintain a well-outfitted -- and well fed -- military...
 PICARD / The Federation would be happy to help you feed your people -- without the need for warfare.
 PICARD / Not charity... a cooperative effort --
 PICARD / (carefully) What I would like... is to be returned to my ship.
 PICARD / (after a beat) And the price for that opportunity?
 PICARD / You've injected me with drugs. You must know that I have already answered truthfully every question put to me.
 PICARD / Then it seems you have more knowledge about the situation than I do.
 PICARD / Torture is expressly forbidden by the terms of the Seldonis Four convention governing treatment of prisoners of war.
 PICARD / I have told you what I know.
 PICARD / (guarded) I see four lights.
 PICARD / There are four lights.
 PICARD / I... know... nothing... about Minos Korva.
 PICARD / There are four lights.
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's Log: Supplemental. I have returned from the rendezvous point in the Lyshan system with Doctor Crusher and Lieutenant Worf. Captain Picard's fate is still unknown.
 WORF is on a biobed, having his shoulder wound tended / by an N.D. NURSE. BEVERLY is on another bed, being checked over by another NURSE. Jellico and Riker are listening to Beverly, who is exhausted and depressed.
 BEVERLY / There was no chance to go back for the Captain. We barely made it back to the Ferengi cargo ship ourselves.
 BEVERLY / (bitter) I don't feel so smart.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. (beat) Request permission to begin planning a rescue operation.
 RIKER / Shouldn't we assume he is alive until we know otherwise? We can't just abandon him.
 RIKER / (tight) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Special operations on Celtris Three.
 RIKER / Under the terms of the Selonis Convention, Captain Picard must --
 RIKER / And what about Captain Picard?
 RIKER / I'm not suggesting that we trade entire star systems for one man's life... but we can at least acknowledge the fact that he was acting under Federation orders... that he is a prisoner of war.
 RIKER / It would give him the protections of the Seldonis Convention --
 RIKER / (hot) I can't believe you're going to sacrifice the Captain's life for a negotiating tactic.
 TROI / Wil, Captain... I think we're all concerned about --
 RIKER / As First Officer it's my responsibility to point out what may be mistakes in the actions of the commanding officer. Sir.
 RIKER / (to Jellico) Sir.
 DATA / Thank you, sir. (beat) But I do not believe that I am more qualified than Commander Riker.
 GEORDI ENTERS, carrying a PADD. He notes Data's / uniform, but doesn't comment on it.
 GEORDI / (to Jellico) I have the report on Doctor Crusher's tricorder readings from Celtris Three.
 GEORDI / Nothing.
 GEORDI / There's nothing out of the ordinary on any of the tricorder logs. Just normal scans of the caverns on Celtris Three and a few tactical scans of armed Cardassians.
 DATA / It is possible that the Cardassians were interested in specifically capturing Captain Picard.
 GEORDI / What makes you say that?
 DATA / The metagenic weapon which they were supposedly developing used a theta-band subspace delivery system. Captain Picard is one of only three Starfleet Captains with extensive experience in testing theta-band devices. The other two are no longer in Starfleet.
 GEORDI / Maybe they're more interested in something he did in the past... something that happened while he was Captain of the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / They might have assumed Captain Picard would know those defense plans.
 DATA / If our theory is correct, it would mean the Cardassians are preparing for an attack somewhere in this sector.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 DATA / If Captain Picard is aware of our defense plans for this sector, we could be at a serious tactical disadvantage.
 DATA / In that case, he may be tortured for information that he does not have.
 PICARD / Your daughter... is lovely...
 PICARD / I'm surprised... that you'd let her come in here...
 PICARD / To let a child be exposed to this... to someone who is injured and suffering... to see that you inflict that suffering...
 PICARD / Be careful, Madred. When children learn to devalue others... they can devalue anyone. Even their parents.
 PICARD / Now, perhaps. What will happen when she's fifteen? Twenty? Are you prepared for the time when she might look at you and see you for what you are -- and despise you for it?
 PICARD / I know that once you were a peaceful people, that you had a rich spiritual life --
 PICARD / Since the military took over hundreds of thousands more have died --
 PICARD / Her belly may be full... but her spirit will be empty.
 PICARD / Be careful... you're showing weakness...
 PICARD / What lights?
 WORF / (off console) The Reklar has gone to warp... they are returning to Cardassian space.
 GEORDI / Captain, I think we've got something.
 GEORDI / It looks like there was some minor hull degradation along their warp nacelles. The distribution pattern indicates a recent exposure to a molecular dispersion field.
 GEORDI / They're found in certain types of quasars... proto-stellar nebulae... some dark matter clouds...
 GEORDI / (works) The McAllister C-Five Nebula is located just over the border... approximately seven light years from Federation space.
 GEORDI / It's possible... but they couldn't stay in there very long. The particle flux in the nebula would begin to degrade a ship's hull after about seventy- two hours.
 GEORDI / Minos Korva is only eleven light years from the Nebula... and the Cardassians tried to annex it during the war...
 DATA / Aye, sir. (to Con Officer) Set course three five zero mark two one five and engage at warp eight point five.
 PICARD / ... le pont d'Avignon... on y danse... on y danse... sur le pont d'Avignon...
 PICARD / On y danse surtout...
 PICARD / (still drifting up) At home... Sunday dinner... we would sing, afterward...
 PICARD / There is a refuge in the mind... a place where even you can't intrude...
 PICARD / What female are you referring to?
 PICARD / What have you done with her?
 PICARD / What about Lieutenant Worf?
 PICARD / Doctor Crusher has no information about any of Starfleet's plans. She is a medical officer.
 BEVERLY / I thought the nebula was in Cardassian territory.
 BEVERLY / I was just part of an undercover mission into Cardassian territory... I felt it was justified in order to destroy a weapon that was potentially catastrophic. (beat) But you're talking about a first strike. An act of war. I can't believe that Starfleet would condone it.
 GEORDI / What if you're wrong, Captain? What if the Cardassians are in that nebula for scientific research?
 BEVERLY / You're still gambling with hundreds of lives.
 TROI / But there are two million colonists on Minos Korva. If we wait until the Cardassians attack... tens of thousands of innocent people could be killed.
 DATA / In another seventeen hours, their hull degradation will reach dangerous levels. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / They will have to leave before that.
 BEVERLY / (bitter) Have Sickbay ready for the casualties you're about to send me.
 PICARD / I see...
 PICARD / No... I'm sure you didn't. (beat) How rewarding it must be now to repay others for all those years of misery.
 PICARD / Torture has never been a reliable means of extracting information... it is ultimately self-defeating as a means of control... and so one wonders why it is still practiced. (beat) The only possible reason must be... pleasure.
 PICARD / Madred, when I look at you now, I won't see a powerful Cardassian officer... but a small boy weeping because he was powerless to protect himself.
 PICARD / (pressing) In spite of what you have done to me... I find you a pitiable man --
 PICARD / You called me "Picard"...
 PICARD / There are four lights.
 PICARD'S VOICE / (with difficulty) You are four years old... weak and helpless... you cannot harm me...
 PICARD'S VOICE / (singing in some desperation) Sur le pont... d'Avignon... on y danse... on y danse...
 WORF / Each container holds a hundred anti-matter mines with magnetic targeting capabilites. When the mines are ejected from the containers, they will attach themselves to the hulls of the Cardassian ships.
 WORF / We are modifying the receiver assemblies on each unit.
 GEORDI / Almost done, sir. I've shielded the engine nacelles and the transporter system so they won't be affected by the nebula's particle flux.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / (surprised) I was on that run for a while.
 GEORDI / (smiles) Oh, yeah... set a course directly for Titan... hold it until you're just brushing the atmosphere... then throw the helm hard over and whip around the moon at point seven c.
 GEORDI / Well... this trip into the nebula's going to need someone who can do Titan's Turn in their sleep. (indicates panel) The mines will have to be laid within two kilometers of the Cardassian ships. But the particle flux from the nebula will blind all the sensors except for the proximity-detector. You're going to need quite a pilot to bring that off.
 GEORDI / No sir, it's not. The man you want... is Commander Riker.
 GEORDI / He's the best there is.
 RIKER / Come in.
 RIKER / (cool) Not at all.
 RIKER / That's right.
 RIKER / Jazz.
 RIKER / Is there something I can do for you, Captain?
 RIKER / Yes, sir. And I understand you've been talking to every shuttle pilot on board.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / As long as the ranks are down, Captain, let me say that I don't like you, either. You're arrogant and closed-minded. You have to control everything and everyone. You don't provide an atmosphere of trust, you don't inspire the crew to want to go out of their way for you, and you get everybody wound up so tight there's no joy in anything. I don't think you're a particularly good Captain.
 RIKER / (hard) Then ask.
 RIKER / Yes.
 RIKER / You're welcome.
 WORF / (off console) The shuttle is about to enter the nebula.
 DATA / Yellow Alert. Raise shields and charge all defensive systems.
 WORF / All defensive systems are powered and ready. (beat) The shuttle has entered the nebula.
 GEORDI / We've lost primary navigation... switching to secondary systems...
 RIKER / Inertial dampers compensating...
 GEORDI / Sensors inoperative.
 RIKER / Right on schedule.
 GEORDI / The proximity detector is working... we should pick up their ships at a distance of... five hundred meters.
 RIKER / (sarcastic) Don't make this too easy...
 RIKER / Hang on!
 GEORDI / Do I want to know how close that was?
 RIKER / No. (beat) Get ready to deploy the mines.
 WORF / (off console) Captain -- the shuttlecraft is emerging from the nebula.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir. The mines are laid.
 WORF / Standing by.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 52   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - ON LIGHT FIXTURE - PICARD'S POV / 
 PICARD / ...still... felt good...
 PICARD / ...don't... believe you...
 PICARD / I... want to see... neutral representative...
 PICARD / What... must I... do... ?
 PICARD / There are four lights.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 PICARD / I relieve you, sir.
 PICARD / You have the Bridge, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I don't know where to begin, Counselor. It was... quite an experience.
 TROI / I read your report.
 PICARD / One thing I didn't put in my report... at the very end, he offered me a choice... between a life of comfort... or more torture... all I had to do was say there were five lights.
 TROI / You didn't say it...
 PICARD / No... but I was going to. I was ready to tell him anything he wanted... anything at all. But more than that, I was beginning to believe there were five lights.
 DATA_HOLMES / (to the gentleman) -- it was then that I began to suspect that your brother did not die by his own hand... that he was in fact... murdered.
 GEORDI_WATSON / But Holmes, the vial of poison found in his hand?
 DATA_HOLMES / That was the first clue, Watson. The vial contained strychnine, which as you well know induces violent muscular spasms. It is difficult to imagine that someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could have held on to so delicate a container without shattering it.
 GEORDI_WATSON / You mean... ?
 DATA_HOLMES / Exactly! The vial was placed in his hand after he died.
 GEORDI_WATSON / Then what did kill him?
 DATA_HOLMES / The cigar, of course.
 DATA_HOLMES / Upon closer inspection of the room where your brother was found, I discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet. Analysis of the ash revealed that the cigar was laced with strychnine.
 DATA_HOLMES / With practice, handwriting can be forged.
 DATA_HOLMES / It takes a trained eye to notice certain... discrepancies.
 DATA_HOLMES / For example, whether someone is...
 DATA_HOLMES / Right or left handed!
 DATA_HOLMES / Your brother was right handed! The alleged suicide note was written by a left handed individual such as yourself!
 GEORDI / Uh... Data? It's in his right hand.
 DATA / (as Data) Curious... There seems to be a problem in the Holodeck's spatial orientation systems.
 GEORDI / (smiles) Freeze program.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Barclay...
 GEORDI / Reg, something went wrong with the Holodeck program again.
 GEORDI / Thanks. Come on, Data, we better get back to Engineering.
 GEORDI / Computer, end program and save.
 GEORDI / Whoa, Reg --
 DATA / Sherlock Holmes program Three-A has demonstrated some very curious anomalies.
 GEORDI / Thanks, Reg. See you later.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46424.1. The Enterprise has arrived at the Detrian system to observe a unique celestial event -- the collision of two planets.
 DATA / Since both planets are gas giants, neither possesses a solid surface. Their atmospheres, however, will come into contact in approximately seventeen hours and nine minutes.
 GEORDI / If their collision causes a self-sustaining fusion reaction... this is what we might see.
 GEORDI / (continuing) The birth of a new star.
 GEORDI / (indicating) The Enterprise will hold position until the gravitational instability subsides and we can move in for a closer look. I want triple redundancy on the sensor arrays. We'll probably never get another chance to see something like this and I don't want to miss anything.
 GEORDI / What?
 PICARD / Professor... it's good to see you again.
 PICARD / I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you. We spent some time investigating how you became self-aware. Frankly, it is still a mystery.
 PICARD / We wrestled with that problem for some time... unfortunately without success. We turned our findings over to Starfleet's most experienced theoretical scientists.
 PICARD / They have not arrived at a solution, either.
 PICARD / I am concerned by the fact that you claim to have experienced the passage of time while you were stored in computer memory... I assure you we had no idea that might be the case.
 PICARD / I understand your frustration --
 PICARD / That's impossible. You cannot exist outside this room.
 PICARD / Computer, exit.
 PICARD / Even though an object appears solid here on the Holodeck...
 PICARD / It has no substance in the outside world.
 PICARD / No, Professor. You are a computer simulation.
 DATA / Possible, but highly unlikely. Your consciousness is computer generated; it is not capable of manipulating physical reality in the required manner.
 PICARD / You must believe me, Professor. If you step outside that door, you will cease to exist.
 DATA / (activates combadge) Data to Security... send two officers to Holodeck Three.
 PICARD / How is this possible?
 DATA / This contradicts everything we know about Holodeck physics.
 PICARD / Professor, if you'll come with me... I'd like our Doctor to examine you.
 BEVERLY is scanning Moriarty with a TRICORDER; he is / seated on the biobed. She seems surprised by the readings she's getting, looks over to Picard, Data and Geordi. The Security Men hang back by the door.
 BEVERLY / From what I can tell... he's real... he's human.
 BEVERLY / His DNA is a little unusual... but all the major systems are there and functioning normally.
 PICARD / Doctor... the Holodeck is capable of creating anatomically correct organisms, down to the cellular level...
 BEVERLY / Right... that's one way we train first year medical students.
 PICARD / Is there any difference between the biological readings of those simulations -- and Professor Moriarty?
 BEVERLY / Yes. The quantum signatures are quite different. They wouldn't read that way on simulations.
 GEORDI / (looking with his VISOR) As far as I can see... there's no evidence that the molecules in his body are losing cohesion. They seem to be as immutable as ordinary matter.
 PICARD / Well, Professor... my crew will continue to investigate, but for the moment you seem to have accomplished a miracle. (beat) The question is... now that you're here... what do we do with you?
 PICARD / Professor... I think there's something you should be made aware of...
 PICARD / Not adrift, Professor. The Enterprise is a Starship, capable of travelling through space.
 PICARD / We can give you books that will help...
 PICARD / I hope you'll plan on staying aboard for a while... we'd still like to understand more about what's happened to you.
 PICARD / I feel it necessary to warn you that criminal behavior is no more acceptable in the twenty-fourth century than it was in the nineteenth. And much harder to get away with.
 PICARD / If that's so, you'll find that there are opportunities available to you that you could never have imagined.
 PICARD / What is it?
 PICARD / Professor... you must believe me when I tell you that we don't know how or why you are able to exist off the Holodeck.
 PICARD / According to the laws of physics, it's impossible. We would have no idea how to do it again.
 PICARD / Even if we had reason to believe that would be successful... I'm not sure I could sanction it. Please understand, Professor... you are in essence a new life form -- one which we didn't intend to create and don't fully understand. The moral and ethical implications of deliberately creating another like you... are overwhelming.
 PICARD / I assure you we will make every effort to make you as comfortable as we can --
 TROI / I understand his frustration. We created him... and we created her to be the woman he loves. Surely we have some responsibility to them.
 BEVERLY / That's very romantic, but until we know just what it was that walked off that Holodeck, I don't think we should be trying it again.
 DATA / There is also no way of knowing if the Professor's ability to exist off the Holodeck is permanent. Perhaps it is unwise to consider creating a second individual while that uncertainty exists.
 PICARD / Agreed. We don't have enough information about this entire phenomenon to act in a responsible way. (beat) We'll hold off on the Professor's request until we know more.
 PICARD / Continue your investigations. In the meantime... I'll have to deal with Moriarity.
 PICARD / I feel I must postpone action... until we learn more.
 PICARD / Forgive me, Professor, but I wonder why you're in such a hurry... is this woman your partner in some illegal venture?
 PICARD / You must love her very much...
 PICARD / Then I would think her safety would be important to you.
 PICARD / Give us a little time to determine what has happened here. That way we can minimize the risk in bringing her to you. (beat) You wouldn't want to lose her... just because we moved too quickly.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / Picard here.
 RIKER / Could you join us on the Bridge?
 PICARD / On my way.
 RIKER / (to Picard) There they are, sir.
 PICARD / How long until they begin to coalesce?
 DATA / Within the next five hours.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, launch four Class-A probes toward the planets.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Worf?
 WORF / I do not understand, sir. Controls are not responding...
 DATA / Sir -- command functions are being rerouted.
 PICARD / (puzzled) For what reason?
 DATA / Unknown, sir.
 PICARD / Computer, route all command functions to the Bridge.
 PICARD / Reinitialize them on my authorization.
 PICARD / Explain.
 PICARD / What's happened? Who's transferred the voice authorization?
 PICARD / Professor -- you've put us in a very dangerous situation.
 PICARD / Those two planets will collide in less than five hours and explode to form a new star. If we don't have navigational control we won't be able to maintain a safe distance -- and this vessel will be destroyed.
 PICARD / Everything you've done to this point suggests that you want to live as much as we do.
 PICARD / (firm) We're studying ways to bring her off the Holodeck safely. But five hours is not enough time.
 PICARD / Mister Data... investigate the possibility of doing what Professor Moriarty has asked.
 PICARD / In the meantime, there are a few things we have to discuss.
 GEORDI / So how are we supposed to do the same thing for the Countess?
 DATA / I believe we are being asked to develop an entirely new science.
 GEORDI / Yeah... in less than five hours. Piece of cake.
 DATA / Perhaps we should consider the Transporter system. It uses many of the same principles as the Holodeck. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / Both, for example, are capable of converting energy into matter.
 GEORDI / Except the Transporter reconstitutes energy into permanent form; Holodeck matter doesn't have any cohesion unless it's inside the grid.
 GEORDI / Nothing would happen. A Holodeck object is just a simulation -- there's nothing there to provide a pattern lock for the Transporter.
 DATA / However, if it were possible to lock onto the object... it might rematerialize with the molecular cohesion of conventional matter.
 GEORDI / That's a big "if"... the Transporter just isn't going to recognize simulated matter.
 PICARD / Professor Moriarty has agreed not to interfere with routine ship operations. As long as he feels we're acting in good faith, we aren't in any immediate danger. Any progress?
 GEORDI / We're talking about using the Transporter to beam the Countess off the Holodeck... But I don't quite see how it's going to work.
 PICARD / Keep at it -- I need to be able to tell him that we're making progress. Mister La Forge...
 PICARD / Do you have any idea how Moriarty was able to take control of the ship?
 GEORDI / (shakes his head) Somehow he managed to override the security lockouts and rewrite them. The guy's brilliant, in any century.
 PICARD / I want you to find a way to undo whatever he's done... so we can regain control of the ship.
 DATA / Set up the pattern enhancers around whatever object you wish to transport. I will proceed to the Transporter Room to begin modifications.
 DATA / Go ahead, Lieutenant.
 DATA / The modifications are complete. Stand by.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Activate pattern enhancers.
 DATA / Energizing... (he works) I am having difficulty establishing a pattern lock... (to the Chief) Boost the confinement beam.
 DATA / Pattern lock established...
 DATA / No. It lost its cohesion as soon as the Transporter cycle was complete.
 DATA / Agreed. However, we may be able to learn something from the attempt.
 DATA / Computer, display transport logs for the sequence just completed.
 DATA / Computer, what is being displayed here?
 DATA / That is the correct log... but no information is being presented.
 DATA / It is as if our attempt to transport the chair... never occurred.
 PICARD / You wanted to see me?
 GEORDI / Yes, Captain... I think I may have found a way to reinstate your voice authorization. Give it a try.
 PICARD / Computer, route all command functions to this location.
 PICARD / Reinitialize them on my authorization.
 PICARD / Picard Epsilon-seven-nine-three.
 GEORDI / That should do it. (works console) Wait a minute... it didn't work. The computer didn't release the command pathways...
 DATA / Geordi.
 GEORDI / (confused by Data's action) What did you do that for?
 DATA / Captain, I have determined how Moriarty was able to leave the Holodeck. He never did. Neither did we. (gesturing around them) None of this is real. It is a simulation. We are still on the Holodeck.
 GEORDI / We're still on the Holodeck... ?
 PICARD / How do you know that?
 DATA / Through deduction. Lieutenant Barclay and I tried to transport a simulated object off the Holodeck -- something that has never been attempted. But since the transporter itself was just a simulation, the computer had no real data from which to create a transport log.
 GEORDI / It could just be a problem with the Transporter...
 DATA / But then I saw you working the PADD with your left hand. Commander La Forge is right-handed. A similar malfunction occurred in the Sherlock Holmes program I was running before Moriarty first appeared.
 PICARD / Data, if what you're saying is true... then this is not Geordi La Forge. Are you certain?
 PICARD / Computer, discontinue program.
 PICARD / Computer, exit.
 DATA / It appears that Moriarty has programmed the Holodeck to accept only his commands.
 PICARD / (activates combadge) Picard to Bridge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker, here.
 PICARD / What is my present location, Number One?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE. / (beat) Engineering... (off his odd request) Is something wrong, sir?
 PICARD / No. Thank you, Picard out. (to the others) Our combadges must be locked into the simulation; if that had been the real Commander Riker, he would have given our location as Holodeck Three.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, will you excuse us please?
 PICARD / Data... who is real here?
 DATA / You and I are real, as is Lieutenant Barclay. We entered the Holodeck together when we first went to see Moriarty.
 PICARD / Then... from that point on... we have been existing in a Holodeck simulation of the Enterprise -- created by Moriarty.
 DATA / I believe that to be the case, sir.
 PICARD / I just gave my command codes to the computer... thinking I was regaining control of the ship.
 DATA / You may have inadvertently given Professor Moriarty the means of gaining control of the real Enterprise.
 PICARD / Since he has never actually left the Holodeck... he'll probably demand that Commander Riker find a way for him to do so. (beat) How long until the planetary collision?
 DATA / Less than three hours.
 PICARD / As long as Moriarty has control of the ship -- we are vulnerable. (beat) Somehow, we have to find a way to give him what he wants.
 RIKER / Where is Captain Picard? What have you done with Lieutenant Barclay and Commander Data?
 RIKER / Release control of this ship.
 RIKER / What do you want?
 RIKER / I think you know that's impossible.
 RIKER / Oh?
 GEORDI / If they tried it, they must have thought they were on to something.
 GEORDI / Just because our Transporter is real doesn't mean it's going to work.
 WORF / Sir... warp core temperature is rising -- approaching critical levels...
 RIKER / (grim) Mister La Forge... start working on the problem.
 WORF / Core temperature is dropping...
 PICARD / Computer, resume program.
 PICARD / Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / No, thank you. (beat) I've come to prevail upon your intelligence and insight.
 PICARD / Credit where it is due, Madame. You are clearly a woman not only of breeding, but of wit and sagacity.
 PICARD / And do you suspect that is my intent?
 PICARD / What does a woman like you see in a man like Professor Moriarty?
 PICARD / He is also an arch criminal.
 PICARD / Then it is your desire to leave the Holodeck in order to be with him.
 PICARD / I can. We've learned that if we uncouple the Transporter's Heisenberg Compensators and allow them to rescramble randomly, we can beam a Holodeck object... or a person... off the grid -- with all the cohesion of conventional matter.
 PICARD / Wait... I came to you with this information because I believe you are someone who will listen to a reasonable proposition. Whose mind is open to compromise.
 PICARD / My ship is in danger... it is imperative that I regain navigational control. You must convince Moriarty to return voice commands to me... or we will not modify the Transporter.
 PICARD / Once I have voice command, I promise we will transport you from the Holodeck.
 PICARD / Please understand -- I am responsible for the lives of over a thousand people.
 RIKER / Any progress?
 GEORDI / I've got my people modifying the Transporter... but I don't see how running Holodeck matter through the pattern buffer will give it molecular cohesion.
 RIKER / Any luck getting back systems control?
 GEORDI / Moriarty has reinitialized the Captain's command codes and input his own. We can't get control without them.
 GEORDI / The gravity well is beginning to intensify.
 RIKER / Are we far enough away to keep from being pulled in?
 GEORDI / It's too soon to tell.
 RIKER / (to com) Riker to Lieutenant Worf...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf here, sir.
 RIKER / How are you doing?
 WORF / There are force fields blocking our access to the Holodeck. It will take time to disable them.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Keep trying.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (on monitor) I don't have time for games, Moriarty. This ship is falling into a gravity well. It'll be destroyed within twenty-five minutes... Holodeck and all.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Moriarty.
 RIKER / (on Transporter Room monitor) We're ready.
 RIKER / (on monitor) Step inside the transport area and activate the pattern enhancers.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Stand by... Energizing...
 RIKER / (with grim irony) Welcome aboard...
 RIKER / Countess... (to Moriarty) Forgive me if I skip the pleasantries... but given the circumstances...
 RIKER / Please.
 RIKER / What --
 RIKER / We had an agreement.
 RIKER / There's no time for this. Release the command codes and we'll talk.
 Riker is standing outside a SHUTTLECRAFT, talking to Moriarty and the Countess through its open door. RIKER / Everything has been programmed to operate on voice command. Just tell the computer where you want to go.
 RIKER / You do have a destination? The shuttle's range is limited.
 RIKER / I suggest you head for Meles Two. It's the nearest inhabited planet, and the people are friendly. Where you go from there is your business.
 RIKER / Every second we waste puts us in that much more danger.
 RIKER / Open shuttlebay doors.
 PICARD / (off-screen) Computer...
 PICARD / Store program Picard delta one in active memory and discontinue simulation.
 PICARD / It worked... they believed they were off the Holodeck.
 DATA / Did Moriarty release the voice commands, Captain?
 PICARD / We'll soon find out. Computer... discontinue the Holodeck simulation created by Professor Moriarty.
 PICARD / (activates combadge) Picard to Bridge.
 RIKER / Captain! Are you all right?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes, Number One. What is your status?
 RIKER / We regained full control of the ship a few minutes ago.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / And the planetary collision?
 RIKER / Six minutes away... we're pulling back to a safe distance.
 PICARD / We'll join you shortly.
 WORF / Captain --
 PICARD / We're all right, Mister Worf.
 RIKER / How did you do it, sir?
 PICARD / We were able to program the Holodeck inside the Holodeck, and use the same ruse on Moriarty that he used on us.
 DATA / When he attempted to contact the real Bridge, he was in fact talking to a simulation.
 TROI / You mean he never realized that he hadn't left the Holodeck?
 PICARD / (gesturing to the cube) The simulation is continuing even now, inside that cube.
 BEVERLY / A miniature Holodeck?
 DATA / In a way, Doctor. However, it has no physicality. The program is continuing... but only within the computer circuitry.
 PICARD / They'll live out their lives... and never know the difference.
 TROI / (smiles) So in a sense... you did give Moriarty what he wanted.
 PICARD / In a sense. And... who knows -- our reality might not be all that different from theirs. All this... (gestures around him) ... might be nothing more than an elaborate simulation being run inside a little device... sitting on someone else's table...
 PICARD / Well... I believe we have a new born star to study. (standing; indicating the cube) Mister Barclay... you'll see that is kept in a safe place?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46461.3. The Enterprise has entered the Ipai Sector, where we are scheduled to deliver supplies to a remote communication relay station near the Klingon border.
 PICARD, RIKER, WORF, N.D.'S. Worf reacts to his / console.
 WORF / Station forty-seven is still not responding to our hails, Captain.
 RIKER / Should be two people aboard. Lieutenants Aquiel Uhnari... and Keith Rocha.
 PICARD / Life signs?
 WORF / It is difficult to scan through the concentrated subspace signals.
 RIKER / (on the move) Mister Worf...
 WORF / What is that noise?
 GEORDI / (over the din) They must've left the audio monitoring system on! We're hearing a few thousand subspace messages! I'll try to shut it off!
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Commander...
 GEORDI / It's coming from inside this service duct... could be a loose cover plate...
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Here's your loose cover plate...
 GEORDI / Hey there, pooch...
 WORF / The shuttlecraft is gone. There is no one aboard.
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / Commander...
 RIKER / (re: the stain) What is it?
 BEVERLY / Cellular residue... I think it's the remains of one of our Lieutenants.
 BEVERLY / All of the blood traces I found match Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
 BEVERLY / For now I'll assume these are her remains... but I'll need to take the deckplate back to Sickbay to make sure.
 RIKER / It would take a powerful weapon to do this...
 BEVERLY / I'll have a better idea after I've analyzed the deckplate.
 RIKER / If that is Lieutenant Uhnari... Where's Rocha?
 BEVERLY / The station's shuttle is gone. Maybe he took it.
 RIKER / Before Uhnari died... or after?
 WORF / (to Riker) We're ready, Commander.
 RIKER / Any luck downloading the station logs?
 GEORDI / Not yet. I can't get past the security lock-outs. (beat) But I think I know why...
 GEORDI / All encrypted subspace messages are sent through this channel. Look at the signal notation...
 RIKER / It's out of sequence.
 GEORDI / (nods) I'd say somebody tried to by-pass the access protocol and break into the coded messages. It caused the security lock-outs to freeze up.
 RIKER / Are there any messages missing?
 GEORDI / I won't know until I can get into the files.
 GEORDI / I'm going to try accessing the logs from another console.
 RIKER / (re: dog) Looks like you've made a friend.
 GEORDI / Yeah...
 RIKER / We're going back to the ship. Let me know as soon as you have something.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 RIKER / (taps combadge) Riker to Enterprise. Four to beam back.
 GEORDI / Come on, girl...
 GEORDI / All right... what do you say we try repolarizing the interface...
 GEORDI / (re: headband) This doesn't look like yours...
 GEORDI / (re: bone) Is this what you're looking for?
 GEORDI / Computer, run station logs in sequence.
 GEORDI / Computer, access visual output.
 GEORDI / Computer... access correspondence files... Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
 GEORDI / Come on, Lieutenant... stick with me...
 BEVERLY / The cellular residue is completely fused with the metal of the deckplate. (beat) We're trying to micro-vaporize the metal... so I can get a clean DNA sample.
 PICARD / Do you have any idea what killed her?
 BEVERLY / Well... this is just a guess, but from the molecular deposition on the plating I'd say it was a highlevel phaser blast.
 RIKER / Could it have been a Klingon disruptor?
 BEVERLY / Possibly.
 RIKER / Geordi found evidence that the encrypted messages might have been tampered with. (with import) We're pretty close to Klingon space...
 PICARD / There hasn't been a Klingon raid against the Federation in over seven years. (beat) I don't want to risk a diplomatic incident until we have more evidence.
 BEVERLY / And there's still the question of what happened to Lieutenant Rocha...
 PICARD / (to Riker) Get Rocha's personnel file from Starfleet Command. And ask Starbase Two-Twelve to help search for that shuttle.
 RIKER / Aye sir.
 PICARD / (to Beverly) Keep me apprised.
 GEORDI / Alright... let's try this again...
 GEORDI / The phase inducers are aligned... this should be working... (beat) Come on, Lieutenant... I know you're in there somewhere...
 GEORDI / (to computer) Computer -- run a subsystem diagnostic, with a frequency range of ten to one hundred megahertz.
 GEORDI / (to replicator) Iced coffee.
 GEORDI / What is it, girl?
 GEORDI / There are at least three references to a Commander Morag -- a Klingon officer who patrols this section of the border. Apparently he would pass the station every few days and harass them.
 PICARD / Perhaps Morag was the one interested in obtaining the encrypted messages.
 GEORDI / Could be. She didn't say. (beat) I still have several days worth of logs left to watch. Maybe I'll learn more.
 PICARD / Very well. In the meantime, I'll talk to the Klingon Governor about Commander Morag.
 GEORDI / (to computer) Computer -- access Aquiel Uhnari's personal logs. (beat) Begin playback.
 GEORDI / Definitely not you.
 WORF / Commander... there are DNA traces here. They are Klingon.
 RIKER / So Klingons did board the station...
 WORF / I have only found DNA from one Klingon so far. I will continue to scan.
 GEORDI / (to himself) How could she read this stuff... ?
 RIKER / How's it going?
 GEORDI / I've managed to access all of Lieutenant Uhnari's logs. I'm looking for Rocha's now. Whatever happened to the encrypted messages had a cascade effect on the whole storage system, and I can't find any of his files.
 RIKER / Maybe Rocha didn't make the official logs... Uhnari might have been responsible for them.
 GEORDI / I don't think so. Aquiel was the junior officer.
 RIKER / "Aquiel"?
 GEORDI / Lieutenant Uhnari. (beat) I was up all night watching her personal logs... I guess I'm starting to feel like I know her.
 RIKER / What was she like?
 GEORDI / Well... she was Hahliian... she had one sister, named Shianna... she drank muskan seed punch... she had a sense of humor that I could only describe as... "unique." (beat) She loved to sing... and read... (beat) ... books of questionable taste.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Enterprise to Commander Riker.
 RIKER / Riker here.
 PICARD / The Klingon ship Qu'Vat has arrived with Governor Torak. Please report to the Observation Lounge.
 RIKER / On my way, sir.
 PICARD / Torak claims to be bringing evidence that the Klingons had no involvement in the murder of Lieutenant Uhnari.
 RIKER / Really. We just found evidence that there was at least one Klingon at the scene of the murder.
 PICARD / This should be an interesting meeting.
 WORF / Governor Torak, sir.
 PICARD / Governor. Welcome aboard...
 PICARD / Lieutenant... why didn't you contact Starfleet and report what happened aboard the Station?
 GEORDI / Forty-six hours.
 GEORDI / You've been gone forty-six hours.
 BEVERLY / We assumed you were dead. Your blood stains were found at the murder scene.
 WORF / Then the remains we found must be Lieutenant Rocha.
 BEVERLY / I can't confirm that. (beat) Until we can separate the cellular residue from the deckplate, I won't be able to get a clear DNA scan.
 RIKER / (to Aquiel) You said you tried to get to the weapons locker... is it possible that you did?
 RIKER / You're sure?
 GEORDI / Your logs said that a Commander Morag had been harassing you... did you ever let him or any other Klingon aboard the station?
 WORF / (to Picard) If that is true, then Morag or some other Klingon boarded the station after she left. (to Torak) We found Klingon DNA traces aboard the station.
 WORF / Have the courage to admit your mistakes. Or are you a lo'Be Vos?
 PICARD / Governor Torak... we are merely exploring all the possibilities. Lieutenant Uhnari's logs said Commander Morag was harassing the station --
 PICARD / If he was only doing his job, then I'm sure you won't mind if we speak with him.
 GEORDI / (to Aquiel) Lieutenant... I know a friend of yours who's very eager to see you.
 GEORDI / Come on...
 GEORDI / Maura... so that's her name.
 GEORDI / No... I'm not much for gothic fiction.
 GEORDI / Yeah... Maura got a little... restless.
 GEORDI / It's alright...
 GEORDI / (continuing) At least she's chewing them up in pairs.
 GEORDI / I'll arrange quarters for you. I'm sure you'd like some time alone...
 GEORDI / I know just the place.
 GEORDI / Yeah... it nearly made me sick.
 GEORDI / (in Hahliian) Batar al nalia. (But not on me)
 GEORDI / (shrugs) Nelo, nelo... (a little, a little)
 GEORDI / Thanks... I've always had a knack for languages... probably because my folks moved around so much...
 GEORDI / The one on the hill?
 GEORDI / Well... to be honest... when we thought you were dead... I had to review your logs... and your personal correspondence... for any possible clues about what happened.
 GEORDI / Most of it.
 GEORDI / You have to remember... we thought you'd been murdered. We needed information.
 GEORDI / I'd feel the same way.
 GEORDI / I'm not sure. The woman I saw on those logs is very complicated. (beat) I think there's more to you than meets the eye, Lieutenant.
 GEORDI / Your relationship with Rocha, for example. He'd only been there five days... but there was already a lot of friction... and you almost seemed to delight in doing things that would upset him. Why would you take on extra com traffic... when you knew it would make him angry?
 GEORDI / I don't know. Maybe both.
 GEORDI / Why do you think he attacked you?
 RIKER / Rocha's file is spotless. Two decorations for valor... three outstanding evaluations from his previous commanders... (beat) Doesn't sound like the same man Lieutenant Uhnari described.
 PICARD / What have you found out about Uhnari?
 RIKER / I checked into her record, too. (beat) Her last posting was on Deriben Five. I spoke with her commanding officer there. He said she's argumentative... quick to take offense. He told me that he transferred Uhnari to this relay station because she was hampering their efforts. (beat) To be honest, sir... I'm beginning to have doubts about her story.
 PICARD / Why?
 RIKER / I had Worf check the weapons locker on the relay station... there's a phaser missing.
 PICARD / You think she lied?
 RIKER / Lied... conveniently forgot... I'm not sure. I just think it's something we have to consider.
 PICARD / As of now, we don't have sufficient evidence one way or the other... I want you to examine her shuttle... perhaps there's something there which will shed some light on her story.
 RIKER / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / Hard to say. Maybe two or three more days...
 GEORDI / No.
 GEORDI / Aquiel... it's been a hard couple of days... I think you need some sleep.
 GEORDI / (quiet) Oumriel...
 BEVERLY / I've managed to isolate the cellular residue from the metal of the deckplate. We've begun a full spectrum tissue scan... (beat) But something destabilized the DNA to such an extent, that I can't get a clear scan of it.
 PICARD / Could a high level phaser blast have caused this kind of DNA disruption?
 BEVERLY / Possibly. But it would take a continuous burst of thirty to forty seconds to cause this kind of damage. (beat) I'm going to try to reform the DNA with a resonance frequency burst... see if I can reconstruct it to get an accurate scan.
 WORF / Commander...
 WORF / (re: phaser) It is set to kill.
 RIKER / (to Aquiel) We found a type two phaser in your shuttlecraft. It was taken from the weapons locker on the station.
 RIKER / The phaser was set to level ten. (beat) Standard procedure requires that all phasers are set to level one when they're in storage.
 WORF / That means someone deliberately changed the setting. (beat) And there is the matter of your conflict with Lieutenant Rocha.
 RIKER / Have you been able to remember anything at all about what happened after he attacked you?
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher tells me that in order to inflict the kind of molecular damage found in Rocha's remains... it would take a sustained phaser discharge of at least thirty to forty seconds. (beat) That doesn't sound like "self-defense" to me.
 GEORDI / Wait a minute. We haven't even established this phaser as the murder weapon yet. (beat) And even at level ten... I don't see how a phaser could do what the medical evidence says it did. A subspace disruptor like a Klingon weapon, maybe...
 RIKER / Look -- we're not here to make accusations... Just to find out what happened. (beat) Commander Morag is due to arrive in two hours. We'll see what he has to say.
 GEORDI / I'd like to go back to the station... and try accessing Rocha's personal logs again.
 RIKER / Good idea.
 RIKER / Geordi... wait a second.
 RIKER / This is off the record. I'm saying this as your friend, not your superior officer. (beat) It might be best if you weren't so... personally involved with Aquiel right now. There's a lot about her we don't know...
 GEORDI / There's a lot about her that I do know... (beat) If she's innocent... I'd like to help her prove it.
 RIKER / I think you're letting your personal feelings cloud your judgement.
 GEORDI / (hard) I'm not the one making judgements.
 GEORDI / Got it... (to computer) Computer -- display personal logs of Lieutenant Rocha. Stardates 46455 to 46461.
 GEORDI / Computer -- what happened to the log entries for Stardate 46460?
 GEORDI / (reacts) Who deleted them?
 GEORDI / Computer -- access internal records for Station forty-seven. Authorization La Forge Theta Nine Nine Two. (beat) Perform a command function trace on the instructions to delete the log entries.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Supplemental. The Qu'Vat has arrived with Commander Morag. We are preparing to question him regarding his involvement in the murder of Lieutenant Rocha.
 RIKER / (unruffled) We found your DNA on the consoles, and on the bulkheads... we know you were there.
 TROI / Concerned... ?
 RIKER / And that's all?
 DATA / Commander Morag, we have discovered that the encrypted message bank on the station has been tampered with. Our analysis indicates that twenty-seven priority Starfleet messages are missing.
 DATA / Your DNA was also found on the message control module.
 PICARD / Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha?
 PICARD / Governor, we would like Commander Morag to remain aboard the Enterprise until our investigation is complete.
 WORF / This way.
 GEORDI / Last night, after I dropped you off at your quarters... (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / you established a subspace link with this console... (beat) You deleted some of Rocha's personal file... didn't you?
 GEORDI / Why?
 GEORDI / Yeah -- it looks pretty bad. (beat) I find out you've erased a letter that contained a possible motivation for murder --
 GEORDI / Then explain this...
 GEORDI / Aquiel... this really complicates things...
 GEORDI / What are you doing?
 GEORDI / (continuing) Aquiel... running away isn't going to prove your innocence... facing the situation will.
 GEORDI / We'll get through this. I promise...
 GEORDI / Yes. I do.
 BEVERLY / Alright. Initiate the resonance frequency burst...
 BEVERLY / I'm starting to get a stable DNA scan... this is odd... (beat) The nucleotide sequences are starting to fluctuate... the DNA is becoming motile.
 BEVERLY / Let's try another frequency burst -- increase the resonance level by twenty percent --
 GEORDI / We've... got a lot of work to do...
 GEORDI / Me neither... (beat) But we've got over six hundred logs to go through...
 GEORDI / I was wondering what that was...
 GEORDI / (softly) Do both of us have to be... telepathic for it to work?
 GEORDI / Go ahead...
 BEVERLY / (re: hand) It's a perfect reproduction of my hand -- all the way down to the DNA structure.
 PICARD / (re: hand) You said it was formed from the organic matter found in the deckplate?
 BEVERLY / When I infused the matter with a resonance frequency burst, it activated the DNA. Then it touched my hand... and started to mimic my cellular structure...
 PICARD / (re: hand) Doctor... what exactly is this?
 BEVERLY / It's going to sound pretty farfetched...
 BEVERLY / Have you ever heard of coalescent organisms?
 RIKER / No...
 BEVERLY / Rare microscopic lifeforms which must absorb other organisms in order to survive. Now, that's not so unusual... but coalescents become the organism they've absorbed -- right down to the cellular level.
 WORF / Do you think that is what happened with your hand?
 BEVERLY / There have been reports that these organisms can exist on a larger scale. What happened to my hand seems to support that theory.
 RIKER / Are you saying that Lieutenant Rocha was killed by one of these -- organisms?
 BEVERLY / It's possible it happened before he reported for duty on the relay station.
 WORF / I do not understand.
 BEVERLY / I've checked the records. Just before he was posted to the relay station, Rocha served on an outpost in the Triona System... (beat) That's in a remote sector... maybe he was absorbed by a coalescent during that mission...
 RIKER / (onto the idea) Then... what came aboard the station, was actually an organism that looked and acted like Rocha...
 WORF / How often must they change bodies?
 BEVERLY / The microscopic organisms have a cycle of no more than five to ten seconds. We can only assume a larger, more complex coalescent would have a cycle of at least several days... or weeks.
 PICARD / If what you're saying is true... Rocha attacked Uhnari because he needed a new body...
 BEVERLY / Right.
 RIKER / But that means... Uhnari's now a coalescent.
 WORF / There was another person on the station -- Morag. It is possible he was the one who was... absorbed.
 PICARD / (to computer) Computer -- locate Commander Morag and Lieutenant Uhnari.
 WORF / (to computer) Where did she go?
 RIKER / (to Worf) You get Morag. I'm going to the station.
 GEORDI / I can see you...
 GEORDI / And I can... feel you...
 WORF / Do not move.
 WORF / Come with us.
 RIKER / (to Aquiel) Step away from him, Lieutenant... slowly.
 GEORDI / What is it, Commander?
 RIKER / That might not be Lieutenant Uhnari...
 GEORDI / What?
 RIKER / Step away. Now.
 BEVERLY (v.o.) / Chief Medical Officer's Log, supplemental. Commander Morag and Lieutenant Uhnari are being kept under close observation. So far, no sign of coalescent behavior has surfaced.
 RIKER / Uhnari and Morag will be transferred to a secure medical facility at Starbase Two-twelve. Maybe we'll know more by the time we get there.
 GEORDI / Yeah... maybe...
 RIKER / (beat) It might be Morag... there's no way to tell...
 GEORDI / (not believing it) Right...
 RIKER / Get some rest. This has been a tough couple of days...
 GEORDI / Thanks...
 GEORDI / (to computer) Computer -- display the Engineering duty roster for the next three days.
 GEORDI / (to dog) Come on now... stop it...
 GEORDI / Maura... ?
 GEORDI / Maybe the reason you don't remember what happened after Rocha attacked you... is that the coalescing process had begun... remember you felt like the memories had been drained right out of you? That's probably just what happened...
 GEORDI / Whatever happened, at least you got away.
 GEORDI / Well. What now?
 GEORDI / (trying to be casual) You know... I had a talk with Chief Pendleton in Communications. There's an opening for a level two specialist.
 GEORDI / (off-hand) I could put in a good word.
 TROI / Computer... lights.
 TROI / (louder) Computer, turn on the lights.
 TROI / (woozy) Who... are you?
 TROI / Where am I?
 TROI / Warbird?
 TROI / I was at the neuro-psychology seminar on Bokara-Six. The last thing I remember was returning to my quarters. I was... (unsure) ...attacked. I felt a... hypospray?
 TROI / My head... is still spinning...
 TROI / Why have you brought me here?
 TROI / Am I a prisoner?
 TROI / The Kaleb sector...
 TROI / Heading... one-oh-two mark four... (beat) She'll... take orders... from me?
 TROI / I'm not going anywhere... tell me what this is about.
 TROI / How do I know I won't be killed anyway?
 TROI / No.
 TROI / (carefully) The mission is one of utmost secrecy. I could not... risk... bringing guards.
 TROI / I... cannot reveal that.
 TROI / I am under orders.
 TROI / (beat) Several months.
 TROI / I don't know what you mean...
 TROI / I'm sure it is safe. Otherwise it would not have been loaded.
 TROI / That cargo is the property of the Tal Shiar. You will not touch it.
 TROI / Mine. And if you do not wish to undergo another "personal experience" with the Tal Shiar, I suggest you not question me again.
 TROI / Commander Toreth... you will now proceed on course bearing one-oh-two mark four to the Kaleb sector.
 TROI / Because those are your orders.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46519.1. We have arrived at Research Station seventy-five to take on a rather unique passenger... one whose homecoming will undoubtedly be difficult.
 RIKER, BEVERLY, and WORF on the move. Beverly carries / a medical tricorder; Riker and Worf do not look pleased at all.
 WORF / The man acted dishonorably. He is a traitor.
 BEVERLY / He risked his life to get here. It took him two weeks alone in a scout ship.
 WORF / That does not excuse his original actions.
 BEVERLY / Well, maybe he finally realized he made a mistake.
 RIKER / It took him twenty years too long.
 RIKER / (to Crewman) Energize.
 RIKER / (hard, formal) Ensign DeSeve. By order of Starfleet Command, you are hereby placed under arrest for treason.
 RIKER / After Doctor Crusher certifies you medically fit, you will be confined to quarters until a formal courts martial can be convened.
 RIKER / And get some civilian clothes. I don't want to see you in that uniform.
 RIKER / The Captain is a busy man.
 RIKER / I'll tell him.
 PICARD / At ease... and it's Captain, actually.
 PICARD / You said it was important that I see you.
 PICARD / What kind of cargo?
 PICARD / This is why you've returned... to bring this message?
 PICARD / In order to know whether Spock's message is being delivered accurately... I need to understand the messenger.
 PICARD / And yet you found something very appealing about it at one time.
 PICARD / But not any longer...
 PICARD / (to COM) Mister Riker. Set course for the Kaleb sector. Warp eight.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye-aye, sir.
 TROI / You may wait outside. Make certain we are not disturbed.
 TROI / They're all terrified of me.
 TROI / It's time you told me what this is all about.
 TROI / What's in it?
 TROI / He's alive... but in stasis. Who is it?
 TROI / M'ret... he's one of the highest ranking members of the Romulan government...
 TROI / Why is he doing this?
 TROI / You are part of Ambassador Spock's underground movement...
 TROI / You've given me the identity of a Tal Shiar officer... is there a real Major Rakal?
 TROI / But -- why me? You could have found a Romulan to play this role...
 TROI / Why?
 TROI / What is your plan?
 TROI / The Corvallens are mercenaries... Do they know what's in these containers?
 TROI / (beat) Very well.
 TROI / I'll go to my quarters. I think it would be best if I stayed away from the Commander.
 TROI / Commander.
 TROI / I've smelled better viinerine on prison ships.
 TROI / (hoping it's right) The Academy.
 TROI / I know of him.
 TROI / Yes.
 TROI / Which aspects are you referring to?
 TROI / Do you have a point to make, Commander? If so, it has escaped me.
 TROI / You've made your opinion of the Tal Shiar quite clear, Commander.
 TROI / We ensure the loyalty of the people. Do you believe the Empire would be better off without our protection?
 TROI / Clearly, your father was a traitor.
 TROI / I don't need your devotion, Commander. Just your obedience.
 TROI / Hail them.
 TROI / (sotto; to N'Vek) He's lying. They have no intention of keeping their word.
 TROI / How many were aboard that ship?
 TROI / This gives me the right.
 TROI / I have been given broad discretionary powers. Sub-Commander N'Vek acted on my authority... the authority of the Tal Shiar. I assure you -- this action will not be questioned.
 TROI / Do what you feel necessary. In the meantime, we must protect ourselves. (to Pilot) Activate the cloaking device.
 TROI / Hold position -- and wait.
 DATA / There is no sign of the freighter, Sir. We are the only ship in the area.
 PICARD / (puzzled) Ensign, verify our position.
 RIKER / Is there anything on long range sensors?
 DATA / (beat; works console) Sensors indicate no other ships within three light years.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Has this all been a hoax?
 PICARD / That's one possibility. (beat) Mister Worf, bring Ensign DeSeve to my Ready Room.
 PICARD / Well, Mister DeSeve. You promised me a freighter with an important cargo. The only thing here is empty space. Do you have an explanation?
 WORF / Sir, he has deceived us.
 PICARD / You said the message came directly from Ambassador Spock?
 PICARD / What does that mean?
 WORF / Was he Romulan?
 WORF / Captain, he could be leading us into a trap.
 PICARD / It would be risky to set a trap here, so close to Federation space... but the fact remains -- there is no freighter. (beat) Ensign DeSeve, did your contact tell you anything else that might be helpful?
 PICARD / Why didn't you mention this earlier?
 PICARD / Perhaps now would be a good time to start. Gentlemen, come with me.
 PICARD / Mister Data, initiate a phase three search pattern -- radius fifteen light years.
 DATA / Aye, Captain.
 PICARD / (gesturing to chair on his left) Ensign DeSeve, I want you to stay right here. In case you recall anything else that might have slipped your mind.
 TROI / Our plan? What about the people on that freighter? Why did you fire?
 TROI / Eighteen people lost their lives...
 TROI / I'm sorry... but I can't dismiss those lives so easily.
 TROI / You don't have a plan anymore.
 TROI / Yes...
 TROI / In a Romulan ship...
 TROI / We'll never get through the gravitic sensor nets.
 TROI / Do you really think this has a chance of succeeding?
 TROI / You will plot a course for the Draken System.
 TROI / Draken Four was the freighter's destination. (beat) I ordered it destroyed because I recognized the Captain -- a known Federation spy. Now, we must deliver the cargo ourselves.
 TROI / I do not intend to explain myself to you. Set a course.
 TROI / That is not a problem.
 TROI / We will be cloaked.
 TROI / The Tal Shiar has obtained access codes for the sensor nets. I will provide them if necessary.
 TROI / Your cowardice does not befit a Romulan soldier.
 TROI / (interrupting) One moment, Commander.
 TROI / We should hold our position until the Enterprise has left the area. We cannot risk detection.
 TROI / We haven't established their intentions.
 TROI / (imperiously) You will keep me informed of our progress.
 DATA / The debris is widely scattered, sir. It appears to be the remains of a ship... (beat) ... My analysis indicates that it was an Antares-class freighter.
 PICARD / Could they have had some sort of malfunction... a reactor core breach?
 DATA / I do not believe so. That would not be consistent with the debris pattern. However, sensors do indicate extremely high levels of residual antiprotons.
 RIKER / Romulan disruptor fire...
 DATA / That is correct. And based on the antiproton decay, I would estimate that the incident occurred within the last four-point-three hours.
 PICARD / Then... the Romulans could still be in the vicinity.
 RIKER / Red alert. Shields at maximum.
 PICARD / (to DeSeve) Whatever cargo was on that freighter, the Romulans didn't want it to reach us. Are you sure you don't know what it was?
 PICARD / All we seem to have here are questions. (beat) Mister Data, continue scanning the area.
 TROI / Somehow, we have to get a message to the Enterprise.
 TROI / This is the perfect opportunity. The Enterprise is nearby. If we can communicate with them, they might be able to help us.
 TROI / (beat) Is there anything you can do to the ship or the cloaking device that would let the Enterprise track us?
 TROI / What we want -- is to get the dissidents to safety. Now answer the question. Is there a way?
 TROI / Yes, you will.
 TROI / We're not playing it your way any more, N'Vek. I've been kidnapped... surgically altered... put in danger... I've gone along with all your plans. Now, you are going to listen to me. You figure out how to let the Enterprise track us, or I will go to Toreth and tell her I've discovered you're a traitor. I'll order you ejected into space. Do you understand me, Sub-Commander?
 TROI / Good. Do it.
 TROI / If that's the best we can do, we have to try it.
 TROI / It's a risk we'll have to take. You're the one who outlined the stakes to me, N'Vek. Are you getting squeamish now, just because things are getting a little more dangerous?
 DATA / (off console) Captain. Sensors are picking up a polarized magnetic distortion to our port side...
 PICARD / Analysis.
 DATA / (works console) The distortion is extremely weak, sir... It appears to be moving, slowly... it -- (beat; surprised) It is gone, sir.
 RIKER / Gone?
 DATA / The distortion no longer registers on our instruments.
 PICARD / Mister Data, could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship?
 DATA / Unknown. Our understanding of Romulan technology is still limited.
 DATA / (off console) The distortion has reappeared... bearing three-three-seven mark ten... (beat) It has disappeared again, sir.
 PICARD / Mister DeSeve, is it your opinion that we're picking up a cloaked Romulan ship?
 PICARD / (after a beat) Mister Data, continue your scan. (to conn) Helm, link navigational control to Mister Data's console. Plot an intercept course toward that distortion.
 PICARD / Where is it now, Mister Data... ?
 DATA / Dead ahead, sir. It is slowing-- (off console) It has disappeared once again, sir. (beat) It may have been coming to a halt.
 PICARD / Stop engines.
 RIKER / If it is a Romulan ship, will they hold position until we leave?
 TROI / What are you doing?
 TROI / (scrambling) Commander, we cannot risk an engagement here.
 TROI / What do you intend to do?
 DATA / (off console) Sir, the magnetic distortion has reappeared.
 PICARD / Bearing and speed?
 DATA / It appears to be moving toward us, closing slowly at one-hundred kph... its bearing indicates a possible collision course.
 RIKER / Time to impact?
 DATA / I am unable to make a precise measurement. However, I estimate impact within ninety seconds.
 RIKER / (to Picard) This doesn't make any sense. Why would they be trying to hit us? And if they were, why not hit us at full speed?
 DATA / Time to impact, approximately sixty seconds.
 PICARD / We don't have the luxury to speculate. (to McKnight) Back us away from that distortion, Ensign. One-half impulse.
 TROI / (firmly) Disregard that order.
 TROI / I do not authorize this attack. You will cease battle operations immediately.
 TROI / How typical of the military to resort to brute force when discretion is required.
 TROI / That's correct -- they can track us. (beat) And if we attack them -- your way -- they will return fire. But we will be vulnerable as we cloak and our shields drop. They will destroy us.
 TROI / You are not fit to command. (beat) Step down.
 TROI / Step down or I will have you removed.
 TROI / If any one of you defies the Tal Shiar, you will not bear the punishment alone. Your families... all of them, will be there beside you.
 TROI / I am now Commander of this ship. You will take orders from me and no one else.
 TROI / Remove Commander Toreth from her station. If she resists, shoot her.
 TROI / (to N'Vek) Remove her weapon.
 TROI / Now, Commander... watch and learn. In order to defeat your enemy, you must first understand them. The Federation wishes to avoid war at all cost. So I shall offer them a diplomatic solution... get them to lower their shields... and then destroy them.
 WORF / Captain, we are being hailed.
 PICARD / On-screen.
 TROI / I am Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar.
 PICARD / I am Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
 TROI / How can we be of help?
 PICARD / A Carvallen freighter was destroyed not far from here... we detected the residual effects of disruptor fire. Can you shed any light on this?
 TROI / A regrettable incident, Captain. The freighter was fired upon by the former Commander of this vessel. I have now taken control, and I assure you there will be no more attacks.
 PICARD / Still, there was a significant loss of life...
 TROI / Captain... we do not want this incident to be exaggerated. You and I can discuss it calmly... diffuse it before it becomes inflated.
 PICARD / Yes... I agree.
 TROI / I will come onto your ship. Please lower your shields and prepare to beam me aboard.
 PICARD / Very well. (to com) Mister Worf, lock onto Major Rakal. Transport on my command.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 TROI / Thank you, Captain.
 RIKER / What's she doing on that ship?
 PICARD / I don't know... but she needs our help to get back. Mister Worf, keep your lock on her no matter what happens.
 WORF / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / (after a beat) Lower the shields...
 TROI / Activate forward disruptor array and fire when ready.
 WORF / Captain, they have fired on us!
 PICARD / Shields up... stand by phasers. (to Worf) Damage report.
 WORF / (puzzled, off console) We sustained a direct hit... but there is negligible damage. The disruptor had almost no power.
 RIKER / They're in stasis... (to COM) Medical team to the Bridge.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Where's Deanna?
 PICARD / Mister Worf -- now.
 GEORDI / Counselor -- are you all right?
 TROI / (breathless) Yes...
 GEORDI / Let's get you to Sickbay...
 PICARD / Ensign, get us out of here -- warp nine.
 BEVERLY / I think that does it. How does it feel to have your own face back?
 TROI / Just right. Thank you.
 PICARD / The men you helped rescue are safe. Proconsul M'ret is deeply grateful for your help.
 TROI / The thanks should go to N'vek... He sacrificed himself to save them... and me...
 PICARD / Thanks to the two of you, the way has been paved for other rescue operations. (beat) You can be sure that N'vek's efforts... and his sacrifice... were not in vain.
 BEVERLY / (to Nurse) Get the stasis units in here and bring them on-line. (to another Nurse) Tell Doctor Selar to use ward three for the ambulatory cases, I'll take the --
 BEVERLY / Acknowledged. (to everyone) Back everyone.
 They all clear out the center of the room as RIKER, PICARD, WORF, and THREE N.D. CREWMEMBERS MATERIALIZE. / Worf is carrying Picard over one shoulder. Riker has a nasty-looking head wound and is pointing his phaser as if defending them. One N.D. is also injured and lying on the floor, while the other two are standing up with phasers drawn.
 BEVERLY / What happened?
 RIKER / The Lenarians attacked us outside the conference room.
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) He's in cardiac arrest. (to Nurse) Get the pulmonary support unit.
 BEVERLY / Internal hemorrhaging... the bioregulator in his artificial heart's been fused... damage to the spleen and liver... what kind of weapon did this?
 WORF / A compressed teryon beam.
 BEVERLY / (to Nurse) Forty cc's inoprovaline...
 BEVERLY / Activity in the isocortex is falling. Cortical stimulator.
 BEVERLY / Now.
 BEVERLY / Again.
 PICARD / What's going on, Q?
 PICARD / You are not God.
 PICARD / I don't know what game it is you're playing, but I am not going to participate.
 PICARD / Q, whatever you've done to --
 PICARD / How do I know this isn't another one of your tricks?
 PICARD / Is that what happened?
 PICARD / The conference...
 PICARD / No. I am not dead. I refuse to believe there is an afterlife which is run by you. (beat) The universe is not that badly designed.
 Picard slowly turns around and sees his father, MAURICE PICARD standing behind him. Maurice is in his / eighties, but seems healthy and vital.
 PICARD / (shocked) Father...
 PICARD / All right, Q... enough.
 PICARD / (hard) Q, stop this.
 PICARD / I hope you're enjoying this, Q.
 PICARD / I find it hard to believe that you're doing this for the benefit of my soul.
 PICARD / "Some time together?"... how much time?
 PICARD / So I'm in hell.
 PICARD / If I'm truly dead, then my only regret is dying... and finding you here.
 PICARD / Is that...
 PICARD / (quiet) It was a... mistake.
 PICARD / (finally admitting) I regret a great many things from those days...
 PICARD / No, it wasn't.
 PICARD / I was... a different person in those days... an arrogant, undisciplined, young man with far too much ego and far too little wisdom. (beat) I was more like you.
 PICARD / The only pity is that I had to be impaled through the back before I learned my lesson. (beat) I started that fight with the Nausicaans... I started it because I was young and cocky...
 PICARD / If I had been more responsible at that age... I wouldn't have needed this heart... and I wouldn't have died from a random energy surge thirty years later.
 PICARD / (quiet) Things would be different...
 We MOVE IN CLOSE on Picard's face and suddenly a WOMAN'S HAND SLAPS him across the face. / 
 PICARD / Cortan? Cortan Zweller?
 PICARD / Marta...
 PICARD / I'm... just a little disoriented...
 PICARD / I'll... catch up with you later.
 PICARD / No, no. I'm fine Marta -- Marty, really.
 PICARD / (irritated) Q...
 PICARD / What's the point of creating this... fantasy?
 PICARD / I don't look it.
 PICARD / I thought you said I was dead... now you tell me I'm alive?
 PICARD / Let's say for the moment that it's true... what purpose does it serve to bring me here?
 PICARD / Change. You mean change the past. Q, even if you have brought me back in time somehow... surely you must realize that any alteration in this timeline could have a profound impact on the future --
 PICARD / I won't do it. I won't alter history.
 PICARD / Starbase Earhart... we came here just after graduation... to wait for our first deep space assignments.
 PICARD / So then I won't die?
 PICARD / What if I don't avoid the fight... what if I don't make any changes?
 PICARD / Wonderful.
 PICARD / That woman's name was... Corlina. I was supposed to take her to dinner... on this night... (beat) But then she found out that... (embarrassed) I'd made a second date with another woman... named Penny. Corlina was... somewhat upset.
 PICARD / Computer, what time is it?
 PICARD / In fact, Penny should be... waiting for me... right now.
 PENNY / You're awfully quiet today. What happened to the dashing young Ensign from last night... the one with the winning smile and the smooth talk about my eyes?
 PICARD / Nothing. I'm just a little more... contemplative.
 PENNY / And what are you contemplating?
 PICARD / Penny, perhaps we could just... talk for a while. I don't know anything about you... where you come from... what your interests are... your last name...
 PENNY / (matter of fact) I come from Rigel, my last name is Muroc and I like men in uniform.
 PENNY / I think that's enough talk.
 PICARD / Penny... I don't think it would be fair... to you to pretend that I'm really interested in a... relationship right now...
 PENNY / Who said anything about a relationship?
 PENNY / What's wrong... Don't I look as attractive as I did last night?
 PICARD / What? No, not at all. You're a very... handsome woman.
 PENNY / Handsome... that's something you say to old ladies.
 PICARD / Penny. To me you are definitely not an old lady.
 PENNY / I wasn't after your pity.
 PICARD / I was a puerile adolescent who let himself be ruled by his hormones instead of his head.
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / (beat) She... decided to leave.
 PICARD / (quiet, urgent) No, don't play him.
 PICARD / It'll cause trouble.
 PICARD / He's a Nausicaan... they can be very ill-tempered when they lose.
 PICARD / (forcefully) Corey, listen to me. This is a bad idea. Don't play him.
 PICARD / Sorry to disappoint you.
 PICARD / He's going to lose. The Nausicaan is cheating.
 PICARD / If history repeats itself, Corey will figure it out later tonight and then he'll want revenge.
 PICARD / I did the first time. I found a way to rig the table so that Corey could win in a rematch.
 PICARD / It was a foolish mistake. The Nausicaan and his two friends didn't take the loss very well. They were outraged... they wanted a fight... (beat) And I gave them one.
 PICARD / It may have simply been extraordinary luck.
 PICARD / That won't solve anything.
 PICARD / What it will do is provoke him. And provoking a Nausicaan is not a good idea.
 PICARD / What if he's not alone... what if he brings some friends along next time?
 PICARD / Corey... there must be a better way to handle this...
 PICARD / We're not cadets anymore... we're officers. We have to start... setting a higher standard for ourselves.
 PICARD / No. I'm sorry Corey, but I won't do it.
 PICARD / I hope so.
 PICARD / What?
 PICARD / (dry) That would be more in character, wouldn't it?
 PICARD / (ironic) Maybe I'm just getting... a little older.
 PICARD / (ironic) It's going to take some getting used to.
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / No, you did not.
 PICARD / We were friends, nothing more.
 PICARD / My friendship with Marta is not something I regret.
 PICARD / (irritably) What do you want, Q?
 PICARD / (softly) Corey...
 PICARD / Sorry.
 PICARD / I'm not here to help you, I'm here to stop you from making a serious mistake.
 PICARD / Cheating the Nausicaan could have serious consequences for all of us. It's a risk we can't afford to take.
 PICARD / (hard) This isn't a joke, Corey.
 PICARD / I said you're not doing this.
 PICARD / No. (beat) But I will tell the gambling foreman that someone's been tampering with his Dom-Jot table.
 PICARD / I just couldn't make him understand.
 PICARD / Yes, but... he didn't take it very well.
 PICARD / I hope so. We were friends for many years after this. (off her look) Or at least... I hope we will be.
 PICARD / (puzzled) You keep smiling at me.
 PICARD / Do I really seem that different?
 PICARD / Really?
 PICARD / Actually... I have. For a long time.
 PICARD / I... don't know. (beat) At the moment... I can't imagine why I didn't...
 PICARD / I don't have anything to feel guilty about, Q.
 PICARD / You're the one who gave me the opportunity to change things...
 PICARD / I don't know. But I do know that things will be different.
 PICARD / Morning.
 PICARD / What's wrong?
 PICARD / I suppose so.
 PICARD / Marta... I don't regret what happened last night... and I hope you don't, either.
 PICARD / I hope last night has only brought us closer.
 PICARD / (smiles) Very well.
 PICARD / (remembering) ... One of you isn't going to make it through the next four years.
 PICARD / Perhaps we should just... pretend that this never happened and try to...
 PICARD / I don't want you to do anything that'll be uncomfortable...
 PICARD / (to Corey) I think you'll like serving aboard the Ajax... I understand Captain Narth is an excellent officer.
 PICARD / (lifts a glass) Well... here's to the class of 'twenty-seven.
 PICARD / I don't think we're interested.
 PICARD / (to Corey) Don't be a fool. (to Nausicaan) There are plenty of other people to play Dom-Jot. Go on about your business.
 PICARD / Corey, I'm sorry. He was drawing a weapon...
 WORF'S VOICE / Can I help you?
 WORF / Can I help you, Mister Picard?
 PICARD / Worf...
 WORF / (off PADD) This is not for me. You should take it to Commander La Forge in Engineering.
 PICARD / (to himself) What's happened... ?
 WORF / Is something wrong?
 PICARD / I'm not sure... (beat, then to Worf) Mister Worf, what's my rank and position?
 WORF / (puzzled) You are a Lieutenant junior grade... the assistant astrophysics officer.
 DATA / Are you feeling all right?
 PICARD / Who's the Captain of this ship?
 DATA / Captain Thomas Halloway. (beat) Perhaps I should escort you to Sickbay.
 PICARD / (quickly) No. I think I can find my way. Thank you, Commander.
 PICARD / Beverly, something's happened to me. I'm not sure --
 PICARD / Q, what have you done?
 PICARD / This is not the present I remember. You said nothing would change.
 GEORDI and an N.D. ENGINEER are working near the pool / table as Picard (still in blue uniform) ENTERS, still carrying his PADD. Everything and everyone is exactly as it should be except for Picard. He looks around the familiar scene... unsure how to respond to all this.
 GEORDI / (to Engineer) ... so tell Duffy that we'll need to adjust the main deflector later this afternoon. Oh, and have him look into that inducer problem.
 GEORDI / (moving to pool table) Hi, Jean-Luc. What's new in astrophysics? (beat) Do you need something?
 PICARD / (remembering PADD) I have the... spectral analysis for you.
 GEORDI / Thanks. (to Engineer) Lynch, try shunting the power through the lateral conduit.
 GEORDI / (frustrated, to himself) So where's the problem... ?
 PICARD / What's going on?
 GEORDI / (distracted) Oh, something's causing a power spike in the starboard warp coil. If I don't track it down soon, the Captain's going to have my head on a platter.
 PICARD / Have you tried flushing the transfer conduits with trioxina?
 GEORDI / (dismissive) No.
 PICARD / The conduits sometimes get blocked by neutrino emissions when the plasma --
 GEORDI / Hey... I know you're trying to make full Lieutenant this year... but I think we can handle this from here.
 PICARD / Am I interrupting?
 RIKER / Not at all. Have a seat.
 PICARD / (to Riker) I wonder if I could talk with you for a moment... about my future on the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc, isn't it?
 TROI / Maybe I should go.
 PICARD / No, please Counselor... I would very much like to hear your thoughts...
 PICARD / First of all... I'd like you to be straightforward with me. How do you evaluate me as an officer?
 TROI / Your performance reports have always been good. You're thorough... dedicated...
 RIKER / Reliable, steady... (beat, then, unable to come up with anything else) ...punctual.
 PICARD / I see. (beat) What would you say if I told you I thought I was capable of being more than that...
 RIKER / Maybe we should discuss this at your next evaluation...
 PICARD / I'd very much appreciate it if we could discuss it now.
 PICARD / I would like to try... to move beyond astrophysics... into engineering or security perhaps. Something which might even lead to a command.
 RIKER / Frankly, Lieutenant... I don't think that's realistic...
 PICARD / Why?
 TROI / I really don't think this is the place to be discussing --
 PICARD / Please. This is important to me. I know I can do more.
 TROI / Hasn't this been the problem all along? Throughout your career... you've had lofty goals... but you've never been willing to do what's necessary to attain them.
 PICARD / Would that be your evaluation as well, Commander?
 RIKER / (uncomfortable) I'd have to agree with the Counselor. You talk about wanting more... but when it comes to doing something about it, you hang back. If you want to get ahead, you have to take chances... stand out from the crowd... get noticed.
 PICARD / I see.
 RIKER / (trying to salve the wound) We don't want to lose you... you're a good officer.
 PICARD / Just not -- one who stands out.
 RIKER / Look... why don't I talk to Commander La Forge... maybe there's something in Engineering. (beat)
 PICARD / But... command?
 RIKER / Well... we'll see.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Senior officers please report to the Captain's Ready Room.
 RIKER / (to com) Acknowledged.
 TROI / (to Picard) I think we should talk about this later.
 PICARD / (quietly) All right, Q. Enough of this. You've made your point.
 PICARD / Q... ?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Lieutenant Picard. I'm still waiting for your final sensor usage log.
 PICARD / (to com, resigned) I'm on my way, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) Main Engineering.
 PICARD / Are you having a good laugh now, Q? Does it amuse you to think of me living out the rest of my life as a dreary man in a tedious job?
 PICARD / I can't live out my days as that person. That man is bereft of passion and imagination. That's not who I am.
 PICARD / You're right. You gave me the chance to change and I took that opportunity. But I freely admit now that it was a mistake.
 PICARD / Yes. (beat) Give me a chance to put things back to the way they were before.
 PICARD / I would rather die as the man I was... than live the life I just saw.
 PICARD / Please.
 PICARD / What did you say?
 PICARD / That's what I thought you said.
 BEVERLY / (off monitor) His vital signs are stabilizing... (beat) Captain... ? Jean-Luc... ?
 BEVERLY / You've been injured... but I think it's going to be all right.
 PICARD / ... I still don't know what to make of it all. Was it a dream? Or one of Q's elaborate tricks?
 RIKER / A lot of people who've been near death have talked about strange experiences... but they're not usually so detailed.
 PICARD / Part of me cannot accept the idea that Q would have given me a second chance... that he would demonstrate that much... compassion. (beat) But if it was Q... I owe him a debt of gratitude.
 RIKER / In what sense? It sounds like he put you through hell.
 PICARD / There were many things in my youth that I'm not proud of... they were loose threads... untidy parts of myself that I wanted to remove. (beat) But when I pulled on one of those threads... I unravelled the tapestry of my life.
 RIKER / (off Picard's look) I was just trying to imagine you as a hell-bent-for-leather young officer insulting a Nausicaan twice your size. I wish I'd gotten a chance to meet that Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / Well, to tell the truth... that wasn't the first time I'd had a run-in with a couple of surly Nausicaans...
 RIKER / Really?
 PICARD / Oh, yes... (beat) During my sophomore year I was assigned to do some training on Morikin Seven. Well, there was a Nausicaan outpost on one of the outlying asteroids...
 PICARD (v.o.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46578.4. The Enterprise has arrived at Station Deep Space Nine, where we will assist in the reconstruction of the Bajoran aqueduct systems damaged during the Cardassian occupation.
 PICARD and BEVERLY come out of an AIRLOCK and begin / walking down the street, past the storefronts and activity. Picard is carrying a briefcase; Beverly has a medical kit. Mid-conversation.
 BEVERLY / I should be finished with the water contaminant analysis in a few hours. Then I'm going to try one of the Holosuites. (beat) I hear they've got a relaxation program here from Alture Seven. First you get bathed in a protein bath... and then a cloud of chromal vapor carries you into a meditation chamber... You should try it.
 PICARD / I'm afraid I won't have the time. I'll be too busy discussing the finer points of water management with ten Bajoran bureaucrats. (beat) And they won't be carrying me on chromal vapor...
 WORF and GEORDI are moving away from the wall of / replicators, having just made identical plates of FOOD. As they head for a table...
 WORF / (re: food) What is this?
 GEORDI / Pasta al fiorella -- you'll love it.
 GEORDI / I'd like to take a look at those Ktarian antiques... I hear there's a twenty-first century plasma coil -- in perfect condition.
 WORF / First we eat... then we shop.
 DATA, RIKER, VARIOUS N.D.s at their positions. A small / WARNING ALARM sounds on Data's console.
 DATA / (off console) Commander -- I am reading a minor power drain in the Starboard EPS conduits.
 RIKER / What's causing it?
 DATA / (works) The problem is originating in Sickbay. There has been an unauthorized access into the computer's bio-imaging systems.
 RIKER / You'd better check it out.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 DATA / (to Bashir) Excuse me. Do you have authorization to work in this area?
 DATA / I am sorry. Use of Sickbay equipment is limited to the ship's medical personnel.
 DATA / Data.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / I would be happy to do so. However, I must ask you to stop your experiment.
 DATA / What type of device is it?
 DATA / It appears to employ beam inputs.
 DATA / I suggest we go to Engineering and begin with a full circuit pathway diagnostic.
 GEORDI / I'll have to talk to Chief O'Brien about the replicators. (MORE)
 GEORDI (CONT'D) / I don't know how you can keep eating it... (beat) It tastes like... liquid polymer.
 WORF / Delicious.
 GEORDI / I think I'll try the kiosk on the other side of the Promenade. It looked like they've got real food.
 WORF / Yes... I am Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / What of it?
 WORF / You have no information I could want.
 WORF / My father died twenty-five years ago at Khitomer.
 WORF / My father is dead.
 WORF / How is that possible?
 WORF / (hard) Tell me what you know.
 WORF / Where is this planet?
 WORF / A Klingon would rather die than be taken prisoner. I should kill you for spreading lies about my family. (adamant) My father was killed defending Khitomer.
 WORF / (to N.D.) Ensign Lopez.
 WORF / (snaps) This duty roster is unacceptable. The assignments must be listed in order of priority. Prepare it again.
 WORF / I will expect it no later than oh nine hundred hours. Understood?
 RIKER / Worf, I'll need that rendezvous schedule sent over to Commander Rudman on the Merrimac as soon as you --
 WORF / (cutting him off) I am aware of your request, Commander.
 RIKER / Lieutenant... are you alright?
 WORF / I am... fine, sir. (beat) I will send the schedule... Excuse me, sir...
 WORF / Enter.
 TROI / Did the table do something wrong?
 WORF / No...
 TROI / I'm glad you weren't that hard on Ensign Lopez.
 WORF / He made a mistake. The duty roster was inaccurate.
 TROI / (right back at him) Would you like to talk about what's bothering you... or would you like to break some more furniture?
 WORF / Today on the Promenade... I was approached by a Yridian. He knew who I was... and tried to sell me information about... Mogh.
 TROI / Your father?
 WORF / He claimed that my father is alive... being held in a Romulan prison camp.
 TROI / (reacts) My god... could it be true?
 WORF / A Klingon would never allow himself to be captured. A warrior fights to the death.
 WORF (Cont'd) / (beat) If my father were alive... it would dishonor his sons and their sons for three generations... (beat) Even Alexander would bear the burden of guilt.
 TROI / So you're willing to ignore the possibility... because you're concerned about dishonor?
 WORF / My father is dead -- the Yridian is selling lies!
 TROI / If you're so sure of that... why are you still upset?
 TROI / (continuing) Worf... you can't deny the possibility just because you don't want it to be true.
 TROI / (continuing) If you want to talk about this... you know where to find me.
 DATA / If we transfer twenty megajoules of energy from the dilithium chamber into the plasma inputs, it should be enough to activate the device.
 GEORDI / Sounds like it's worth a try. (beat) You two can start by connecting the coil to the chamber. I'll configure the energy transfer...
 DATA / Certainly.
 DATA / I can control the rate of my follicle replenishment. However, I have not yet had a reason to modify the length of my hair. (beat) Why do you ask?
 DATA / Is there something wrong, Doctor?
 DATA / Yes. I do have a functional respiration system. However, its purpose is to maintain the thermal control of my internal systems. I am, in fact, capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum.
 DATA / My circulatory system not only produces bio-chemical lubricants, but regulates micro-hydraulic power.
 DATA / (intrigued) Most people are usually interested in my extraordinary abilities. How fast I can compute, my memory capacity, how long I will live. (beat) But no one has ever asked me if my hair can grow, or noticed that I can breathe.
 GEORDI / We're ready to begin the transfer.
 DATA / The power connections are complete.
 DATA / Of course.
 DATA / We are ready, Geordi.
 GEORDI / (working) Initiating energy transfer...
 DATA / (off tricorder) Transient response is normal.
 GEORDI / Reducing rate by... twenty percent.
 GEORDI (V.O.) / His net's been overloaded --
 DATA / I believe so. (beat) What happened?
 GEORDI / A plasma shock overloaded your positronic net. You were down for a good thirty seconds.
 DATA / That cannot be correct. (beat) I have a memory record for that period of time. I can recall a series of images.
 DATA / (continuing) I saw Doctor Soong... my father.
 GEORDI / (off instrument) I can't find anything wrong with your positronic sub-processors... or with your controllers...
 GEORDI / No sign of a residual energy fluctuation... cascade overload...
 DATA / My internal diagnostic indicates that my memory systems are functioning within normal parameters. (beat) For the forty-seven seconds that I was inactive, there is no record of any cognitive activity.
 GEORDI / There's no doubt about it, Data -- you were completely shut down.
 GEORDI / Maybe you had some kind of random power fluctuation... and it accessed one of your memory files.
 DATA / That is not possible. The image I saw was of Doctor Soong as a young man. I encountered him only much later in his life.
 DATA / (continuing) There does not appear to be a rational explanation for my experience.
 GEORDI / I'll take a look at the diagnostic log again... (beat) In the meantime, we'd better disconnect that medical device...
 DATA / What do you mean?
 DATA / I am not capable of either of those functions.
 DATA / At present, I cannot.
 WORF / Wait.
 WORF / (continuing) What is it, Commander?
 DATA / I am sorry to bother you. But I have a question of a personal nature. Do you have a moment?
 WORF / A moment.
 DATA / I have heard you mention that you once experienced a vision.
 WORF / Yes... when I was young... my adoptive parents arranged for me to partake in the Rite of MajQa.
 DATA / I understand it involves deep meditation inside the lava caves of No'Mat. Prolonged exposure to the heat induces a hallucinatory effect.
 WORF / I spent six days in the lava caves. For five days I saw nothing. Then, on the sixth day, as I was preparing to leave the caves... Kahless came to me.
 DATA / Kahless. The entity you invoke during the Klingon Death Ritual?
 WORF / (nods) When he appeared before me... he told me that I would do what no Klingon had ever done.
 DATA / You did become the first Klingon in Starfleet.
 WORF / Yes. It is as he said.
 WORF / Why are you asking me about this?
 DATA / I have recently had an unexplained experience, which might be described as a "vision".
 WORF / What happened?
 DATA / An accident in Engineering shut down my cognitive functions for a short period of time. And yet, I seemed to remain conscious. (beat) I saw my father.
 WORF / You are fortunate. That is a powerful vision.
 DATA / If it was a vision, I am not sure how to proceed.
 WORF / (it's obvious) You must find its meaning.
 WORF / (explains) If it has anything to do with your father, you must learn all you can about it. (beat) In the Klingon MajQa ritual, there is nothing more important than receiving a revelation about your father.
 WORF / (continuing) Your father is part of you... always. Learning about him tells you about yourself... (beat) That is why, no matter where he is... or what he's done... you must find him.
 DATA / But I am not looking for my father.
 WORF / Yes, of course...
 WORF / (continuing) Do not stop until you have the answer.
 DATA / Thank you, Worf.
 WORF / Yes. I wish to go to the Romulan prison camp.
 WORF / No. You will take me there.
 WORF / I checked the station records. You have a vessel capable of warp speed.
 WORF / What is the real reason you do not want to take me? Is it because what you have said is not true?
 WORF / Dangerous... (beat) It would be more dangerous for you to refuse.
 WORF / I will pay you after.
 WORF / And if you are lying... if there is no prison camp... (beat) I will kill you.
 WORF / The foliage is very dense. It will take me approximately twelve hours to reach the camp. (beat) I will have to travel during the night.
 WORF / (confident) I am prepared.
 WORF / How did you learn of this camp?
 WORF / Why have you not informed the Klingon government of this place?
 WORF / (accusing) You withhold this information... for profit.
 WORF / What reason could you have for letting these people suffer?
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / Yes, Mister Data?
 DATA / I am sorry to disturb you, sir.
 PICARD / Not at all. I'm just studying the intricacies of Bajoran aqueduct management... (lightly) I could use an interruption about now. Please, sit down.
 DATA / I require your advice. I have come to an impasse regarding my recent unexplained experience.
 PICARD / Oh yes... of course... your "vision" of Doctor Soong. How's your investigation coming along?
 DATA / I have analyzed over four thousand different religious and philosophical systems, as well as over two hundred psychological schools of thought in an effort to understand what happened.
 PICARD / What have you found?
 DATA / I have been unable to find a single interpretation of the images I saw during the time I was shut down. (beat) The image of a hammer, for instance, could have many different meanings. Klingon culture views the hammer as a symbol of power. However, the Taqua tribe of Nagor views it as an icon of hearth and home. The Feregni see it as a sign of sexual prowess.
 PICARD / I'm curious. Why are you looking at all these other cultures?
 DATA / The interpretation of visions and other metaphysical experiences are almost always culturally derived. (beat) And I have no culture of my own.
 PICARD / Yes you do. You are a culture of one. And that's no less valid than a culture of one billion.
 PICARD / (continuing) Perhaps the key to understanding your experience is to stop looking into other sources for meaning... (explains) You wouldn't look at Michaelangelo's David... or Symnay's Tomb... and ask "what does this mean to other people?" The real question is, "what does it mean to you?"
 PICARD / (with emphasis) Explore the image, Data. Let it capture your imagination. Focus on it... spend some time with it... and see where it takes you. Let it inspire you.
 DATA / I believe I understand, sir. Thank you.
 PICARD / Good luck, Data.
 WORF / When will you be back?
 WORF / Stop, please...
 WORF / I have come to help you...
 WORF / Yes... (beat) How did you get out of the camp? Does anyone know you are gone?
 WORF / You must lead me to the camp.
 WORF / That does not matter. I am here to take you home.
 WORF / (quickly) It is important that you tell no one you saw me.
 DATA (O.S.) / Enter.
 GEORDI / Data, where have you been? We were supposed to...
 GEORDI / Data... what are you doing?
 DATA / I am painting.
 GEORDI / I can see that...
 GEORDI / (continuing) How long have you been at this?
 DATA / I have created twenty-three individual illustrations over the past six hours, twenty-seven minutes. (beat) I believe you could say -- I have been "inspired."
 GEORDI / I'll say...
 DATA / I have done as Captain Picard suggested: I have tried to explore the images.
 GEORDI / Has it helped?
 DATA / I am not sure.
 DATA / (re: paintings) I began by painting the image of the blacksmith. Then the anvil. The hammer. Doctor Soong's face.
 DATA / (continuing) The thought then occurred to me that I should paint -- smoke.
 GEORDI / Smoke... why smoke?
 DATA / I cannot explain it. It was not an image I saw during my vision.
 GEORDI / Well... you have the smoke coming out of a bucket of water. Blacksmiths sometimes used water to cool the metal. Maybe that's why you painted it...
 DATA / Perhaps.
 DATA / (re: painting) After I painted smoke, it occurred to me to paint -- a bird's wing.
 DATA / I then drew an entire bird. A flock of birds flying in formation. An individual feather. (beat) If the image of a bird is related to my vision, I do not understand how. (beat) I am left with more of a mystery than ever.
 DATA / (continuing) Geordi, I would like to recreate the experiment which caused my initial shut down.
 GEORDI / What for?
 DATA / I do not know how much longer my vision would have continued, had I not been reactivated.
 GEORDI / (dubious) Your neural net was almost fused by that plasma shock. I don't think it's such a good idea to try it again...
 DATA / I am aware of the risks involved. But I can see no other way to investigate my experience. (beat) Will you help me?
 GEORDI / Okay... I'll get Doctor Bashir.
 DATA / And I will prepare the power transfer.
 GEORDI / (to Data, re: cables) We're going to monitor every subsystem in your positronic net. If I see any neural pathways overload beyond sixty-five percent... I'm shutting down the experiment.
 DATA / Agreed.
 GEORDI / Initiating energy transfer...
 GEORDI / Get ready, Data...
 GEORDI / Should be any second now...
 DATA / (to himself) That bird did not appear in my original experience. This vision is different.
 DATA / (to Soong) Father, what is happening?
 DATA / We are on the Bridge of the Enterprise. My cat is present, and my potted plant, and my paintings.
 DATA / I do not understand.
 DATA / What type of journey?
 DATA / I do not understand.
 DATA / The images I saw during the time I was shut down were generated by a series of previously dormant circuits in my neural net. (beat) I believe Doctor Soong incorporated those circuits into my base programming, intending them to be activated when I reached a certain level of development.
 DATA / That is correct.
 DATA / I plan to shut down my cognitive functions for a brief period of time each day. (beat) I hope to generate new internal visions.
 DATA / An accurate analogy.
 DATA / Of course not.
 WORF / (harsh whisper) Quiet! I am a friend.
 WORF / I am Worf... son of Mogh.
 WORF / I have come to find my father. Is he alive? Is he here?
 WORF / Did he... die in battle?
 WORF / You were captured...
 WORF / The Romulans robbed you of your right to die with honor.
 WORF / There is little time. How many Klingons are being held here?
 WORF / How many Romulans guard the camp?
 WORF / What do you mean?
 WORF / Yes... I still have the scar...
 WORF / I remember you now...
 WORF / I do not understand.
 WORF / I am Worf... son of Mogh. I have come to help you escape.
 WORF / Are you afraid to die escaping?
 WORF / Why did you allow it to happen?
 WORF / I understand your desire to preserve your families' honor. But what of your own? There is no honor in remaining prisoners.
 WORF / I am a Starfleet officer.
 WORF / Much has changed since Khitomer.
 WORF / If he had been captured as you were, if I had found him here... I would be glad to see him. There would be no room in my heart for shame.
 WORF / This is a Gin'tak spear.
 WORF / Have your parents taught you nothing? This is used for battle -- not for tilling soil.
 WORF / What war?
 WORF / That war... has been over for years.
 WORF / Not by choice.
 WORF / The war...
 WORF / A place can be safe -- and still be a prison. Where I come from, people are free to come and go as they choose.
 WORF / Tell your Father you would like to leave. Tell him you want to visit the Klingon home world. See what he says.
 WORF / Not any longer.
 WORF / Enter.
 WORF / It is a strange thing when a jailer concerns himself with his prisoner's comfort.
 WORF / You robbed the Klingons of who they were. You dishonored them.
 WORF / I don't expect you to understand. You are a Romulan.
 WORF / Why did you do it?
 WORF / Do not deceive yourself. These people are not happy here. I see sadness in their eyes.
 WORF / Do you know what that song means?
 PICARD (v.o.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46580.1. The Yridian vessel Lieutenant Worf boarded at Deep Space Nine has failed to arrive for our scheduled rendezvous. It is now twelve hours overdue.
 PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room. RIKER, DATA, TROI / and various N.D's are at their posts.
 RIKER / Still no sign of them on long range scanners, sir.
 PICARD / Contact DS Nine -- find out what they know about this Yridian trader.
 RIKER / Hopefully he filed a flight plan before he left the station.
 PICARD / (nods) That's the only chance we have of finding Worf.
 PICARD / When Worf asked for leave... I had the feeling he was hoping none of it was true: that his father was dead, that he hadn't been captured.
 TROI / I think part of him was hoping that. But another part of him wanted more than anything to find his father.
 PICARD / I'm sure that's true. (beat) But if Mogh... or any other Klingon... had been held prisoner for twenty years... would they want to be found?
 WORF / Never.
 WORF / The Mok'bara...
 WORF / The forms clear the mind... and center the body.
 WORF / No. Like this...
 WORF / (to the gathered young people) This is the Mok'bara... a great warrior called Kahless invented the forms when he went to the underworld in search of his father. Kahless showed him the forms, and his father was able to remember his body and return to the world of the living.
 WORF / First you must learn to breathe... stand up... as tall as you can...
 WORF / Take a wider stance.
 WORF / The forms are the basis for Klingon combat. You would be wise to learn them.
 WORF / I will teach you. Join us.
 WORF / Again... take your stance...
 WORF / Yes...
 WORF / (pointing to breastplate) This is a warrior's armor.
 WORF / And this is the D'k tahg...
 WORF / It should not be allowed to rust like this...
 WORF / That is a Jinaq... it is given to a daughter when she comes of age, old enough to take a mate.
 WORF / Why is she forbidden to know what these things are?
 WORF / ... Kahless held his father's lifeless body in his arms. He could not believe what his brother had done. Then his brother threw their father's sword into the sea, saying that if he could not possess it, neither would Kahless. That was the last time the brothers would speak.
 WORF / Kahless looked into the ocean and wept, for the sword was all he had left of his father... and the sea filled with his tears and flooded beyond the shore.
 WORF / The people begged Kahless to stop his weeping, and he did... and walked into the water to find the lost sword. (MORE)
 WORF (Cont'd) / He searched and searched the murky ocean bottom, holding his breath for three days and three nights...
 WORF / For you, perhaps. Not for Kahless. He was a great warrior.
 WORF / These are our stories. They tell us who we are.
 WORF / Yes. He found it.
 WORF / I have studied them all my life... and find new truths in them every time.
 WORF / That is... another story.
 WORF / You are... Romulan.
 WORF / How could your mother... mate with a... Romulan?
 WORF / It is... an obscenity.
 WORF / Romulans are treacherous... deceitful... they are without honor.
 WORF / He was part of a cowardly attack on Khitomer... thousands of Klingons were massacred -- many of them women and children.
 WORF / Ask him. Ask your mother. Tell them you want to know the truth.
 PICARD / What is it, Number One?
 RIKER / We just received the Yridian's flight plan from Deep Space Nine.
 GEORDI / He gets around... he's been to three different systems in the past week -- he could have left Worf at any of them.
 PICARD / Are any of these systems near Romulan space?
 GEORDI / Two of them. The Nequencia and the Carraya systems.
 PICARD / Let's head for the closer one.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 WORF / I... I am sorry if I upset you.
 WORF / I was surprised... I became angry. But I do not blame you. You cannot help being what you are.
 WORF / What I mean is... it is not your fault.
 WORF / No, I...
 WORF / It is hard to explain. Klingons and Romulans are blood enemies -- we have been for centuries...
 WORF / But I do not live here.
 WORF / I don't know.
 WORF / You are responsible. She is what she is because of you. (with disgust) Lying down with a Romulan.
 WORF / I understand your sacrifice. And I respect it. But to mate with a Romulan -- this I do not understand.
 WORF / Ka'la!
 WORF / The Qa'vak is not a game -- it hones the skills of the hunt.
 WORF / Klingons do not hunt because they need food. The hunt is a ritual that reminds us of where we come from.
 WORF / It is a difficult skill to master. Perhaps you are too young.
 WORF / Your arm is strong. But it needs practice. Hold your other arm like this... (he demonstrates) ... and aim along it.
 WORF / Throw.
 WORF / Ka'la!
 WORF / You learn quickly. Perhaps it is time to put your skills to the test.
 WORF / Come. I will teach you how to hunt.
 WORF / I think they will.
 WORF / The boy could come with me.
 WORF / I cannot sit in the compound like an old man. I must practice my skills.
 WORF / I give you my word as a warrior. I will not try to escape.
 WORF / Kahless was condemned to die by the tyrant Molor, who was angered that Kahless had incited the people against him. The night before his execution, Kahless asked that he be allowed to go out into the night and say farewell to the moon and the stars... for he knew that in the netherworld, he would not see them again.
 WORF / Kahless gave his word that he would come back, and Molor let him go.
 WORF / The next day at dawn, Kahless returned... and was put to death.
 WORF / He had given his word. Molor understood what that meant. Just as L'Kor did.
 WORF / Come.
 WORF / (gestures) He is there. But the wind has shifted. We must wait.
 WORF / Never approach your prey from upwind; the breeze will carry your scent.
 WORF / The wind is shifting again.
 WORF / He is there.
 WORF / Remember the scent. More than anything else, it will guide you.
 WORF / Let it work its way into your blood.
 WORF / Yes. This is the moment where life and death meet.
 WORF / This is who we are. Warriors.
 WORF / There is much you were never taught.
 WORF / I have done nothing more than show them what they are.
 WORF / It is a worthy achievement to bring peace between enemies. (beat) But the cost of that peace may be too high.
 WORF / The people here have lost the sense of who they are. They have lost their heritage.
 WORF / Those are our rituals... they define us. They tell us what we came from... what our children will grow to be. Without traditions, we have no identity -- we have no pride.
 WORF / Today Toq went with me on the ritual hunt... I saw what happened to him when he caught the scent of his prey on the wind... for the first time in his life, he felt powerful... that's what he has been denied by living here... that's what you have tried to take away from him. (MORE)
 WORF / For you, perhaps that is enough. The young people may want more.
 WORF / Or?
 WORF / Then that is what you will have to do.
 WORF / That death will be honorable. The young people will see what it is to die as a Klingon.
 WORF / Enter.
 WORF / Why are you doing this?
 WORF / I am not going to run away, Ba'el.
 WORF / Yes. But they will not defeat me.
 WORF / A Klingon does not run from his battles.
 WORF / Then you don't yet understand what it is to be Klingon.
 WORF / I... would not have thought it possible to love a Romulan...
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / If there were a way... I would take you with me...
 WORF / And if I stay here... these Klingons will not accept me for what I am.
 WORF / Ba'el...
 WORF / Your words are eloquent, Tokath. But the truth is that I am being executed because I brought something dangerous to your young people: knowledge.
 WORF / Knowledge of their origins. Knowledge of the real reasons you are here in this camp. The truth is a threat to you...
 WORF / You see, Tokath? It's already too late.
 WORF / He has the right to make his choice.
 WORF / Years ago, your parents made a great sacrifice for the sake of their families. Today they do so again. For that, we must honor them.
 WORF / You must promise them -- that you will never reveal their secret. No one must know of this place.
 PICARD (V.O) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46581.5. We have scanned the planets of the Nequencia system and found no evidence of a Romulan prison camp. We are now enroute to the Carraya system, closer to Romulan space.
 DATA / Captain, we are receiving a subspace message. It is a Romulan signal, text only. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (surprised) It is from Lieutenant Worf. He is aboard a Romulan scout ship.
 DATA / He is requesting a rendezvous.
 PICARD / Input the coordinates and change course.
 BEVERLY / They seem fine. We'll be giving them all thorough checkups in Sickbay.
 PICARD / Thank you, Doctor.
 PICARD / Welcome home, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Bridge. Signal the Romulan ship that we have the last group on board.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I see you found what you were looking for, Mister Worf.
 WORF / No, sir. There was no prison camp.
 WORF / Those young people are survivors... of a vessel that crashed in the Carraya system four years ago.
 WORF / No one survived Khitomer.
 PICARD / I understand, Mister Worf.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 46682.4. The Enterprise is docked at the Remmler Array, where it will undergo a routine procedure to eliminate accumulated baryon particles. In preparation for the sweep, we are evacuating the ship.
 TROI / Captain... we're still behind schedule on decks seven and eight. Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll be a delay?
 PICARD / No. Open up the Transporters in Cargo Bay Two and divert everyone from deck seven there. That should get us back on track.
 TROI / Right.
 BEVERLY / Captain... Arkaria Base does not have the medical storage units I requested. I have seven living tissue samples that won't survive the baryon sweep anymore than you or I would. I've tried to reason with them, but --
 PICARD / Have Mister LaForge transport a stasis unit from the astrophysics lab. You should be able to convert it to store tissue samples.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 RIKER / Captain... I was just heading for deck seven. I've put the auto-shutdown sequence on hold until we get back on schedule.
 PICARD / I think we can resume the sequence. Counselor Troi is taking care of the situation on deck seven.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Captain.
 PICARD / Mister Data. (as he faces front) Bridge.
 DATA / It has been quite a day, has it not?
 PICARD / Yes it has.
 DATA / However, a change of routine is often invigorating and can be a welcome diversion after a long assignment.
 PICARD / (more of the same) Exactly.
 DATA / I understand that Arkaria has some very interesting weather patterns.
 PICARD / Data -- are you alright?
 DATA / Yes, sir. I was attempting to fill a silent moment with non-relevant conversation.
 PICARD / (thinks) Small talk?
 DATA / Yes, sir. I have found that humans often make "small talk" during awkward moments. Therefore, I have written a new subroutine designed for that purpose. How did I do?
 PICARD / Perhaps it was a little too... non-relevant. However, if you're interested in small talk keep your eye on Commander Hutchinson during the reception this afternoon... (not looking forward to it) ... he's a master.
 DATA / Thank you sir, I will.
 GEORDI / (to Worf) After you...
 WORF / (to Geordi) No sir. I believe you spoke first.
 PICARD / We're running out of time, gentlemen. Mister Worf?
 WORF / The computer needs your authorization to disable command functions during the baryon sweep.
 PICARD / Are we ready, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / Almost. I've requested some additional field diverters for the computer core and the Bridge and they haven't been installed yet.
 PICARD / (concerned) Additional units?
 GEORDI / We've logged more warp hours in five years than most ships do in ten, so our baryon particle levels are pretty high. I'm a little worried that when the Remmler Array starts sweeping the ship it might have to use a stronger beam than normal to clear out all the radiation.
 PICARD / (understanding) And that might overload the field diverters protecting our key systems. How long until the new ones are in place?
 GEORDI / I'd say another twenty minutes.
 PICARD / Very well. (to com) Computer, disable all command functions in thirty minutes. Authorization: Picard gamma-six-zero-seven-three.
 WORF / (off console) Incoming message, Captain. It's the station administrator, Mister Orton.
 PICARD / In my Ready Room.
 WORF / Sir. Request permission to be excused from Commander Hutchinson's... reception.
 PICARD / Permission granted. I only wish I could excuse myself as well.
 GEORDI / Captain, permission to --
 PICARD / Sorry, Mister LaForge... I can't excuse the entire senior staff. Worf beat you to it.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Mister Orton.
 PICARD / Confirmed.
 PICARD / Tell him... I'm looking forward to it.
 BEVERLY / It's good to see you again.
 BEVERLY / Of course.
 RIKER / I guess I must.
 RIKER / Oh?
 RIKER / Uh, sure.
 PICARD / Commander.
 DATA / It is very good to see you both again. May I call you Beverly? -- Beverly, do you find the mean temperature here on Arkaria to be slightly above normal for human comfort levels?
 DATA / I have found that most humans prefer a temperature of twenty-one degrees C in order to operate most efficiently. However, there are some cultures which actually...
 PICARD / Geordi! Deanna! I don't believe you've met our host. (to Hutchinson) Allow me to introduce Commander Geordi La Forge, Counselor Deanna Troi. This is Commander Hutchinson.
 GEORDI / Hello.
 TROI / Hello.
 TROI / Uh... well...
 PICARD / Horses?
 PICARD / That sounds... perfect. (beat, then to Geordi) How long until the baryon sweep begins on the Enterprise?
 GEORDI / At least twenty-five minutes.
 PICARD / Then I'll have time to get my saddle.
 TROI / Your... saddle?
 PICARD / Yes. (notices their looks) A saddle is a very personal thing. It has to be broken in... worn... cared for...
 GEORDI / You keep a saddle... on the Enterprise?
 PICARD / Yes. (beat) I've had it since the Academy. (beat) I never know when I'll have the opportunity to ride.
 TROI / I see.
 PICARD / It's perfectly normal. Most serious riders have their own saddles.
 TROI / Of course.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / If you'll excuse me.
 PICARD / Somone left this ODN junction box open. (beat) I thought your crew was supposed to leave the ship once the field diverters were in place.
 PICARD / I see. Well, I suppose I'd better let you finish up so you can get off the ship.
 DATA / I find it fascinating that your family chose to drop the prefix "Pel" from your surname. It was my understanding that "Pel Orton" would be considered a more noble appellation on Arkaria than simply Orton.
 DATA / Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend toward a more egalitarian society is partly responsible.
 RIKER / I'm trying to.
 RIKER / Hutch. Have you met our Commander Data?
 DATA / (to Orton) ... there are several cultures in this sector with remarkably similar etymological histories --
 RIKER / Data, allow me to introduce our host. This is Commander Hutchinson -- call him Hutch. (to Hutchinson) This is our second officer, Commander Data.
 DATA / (to Hutchinson) The pleasure is mine. I have been meaning to compliment you on your choice of colors here.
 DATA / I am sure of that. The light in this room makes color selection exceptionally problematic.
 RIKER / You're welcome. (glancing back) I'm not sure which one to feel sorry for.
 RIKER / Geordi... what happened to the Captain?
 GEORDI / He went back to the ship to get his saddle.
 RIKER / His saddle?
 GEORDI / (like it's obvious) Any serious rider would have his own saddle.
 RIKER / Oh.
 GEORDI / He probably went right to the stables. I bet he's ten kilometers from here already.
 RIKER / (glances at Hutchinson & Data) Lucky him.
 PICARD / Who are you? What are you doing on my ship.
 PICARD / (unfazed) You're probably right.
 PICARD / But I'm willing to bet that this will.
 PICARD / (continuing) What's going on in Main Engineering?
 PICARD / I suggest you cooperate.
 PICARD / Are you sure?
 PICARD / (to Devor) I guess you're right.
 DATA / ... yes, but Tyrellian laser-art is very similar in form and composition.
 DATA / Really? There are five Tyrellians currently serving aboard the Enterprise.
 DATA / I was aware of that. Are you aware that Tyrellia is also one of seven known planets...
 TROI / Are they still at it?
 RIKER / Non-stop. I have to admit it has a sort of strange fascination... I mean, how long can two people talk about... nothing?
 GEORDI / Uh... I don't know. I'm getting a weird energy reading from your table.
 GEORDI / Maybe I should take a look at it.
 GEORDI / I really think I should look at that heating element. If it overloads under --
 RIKER / What's that all about?
 PICARD / My name is Mott. I'm... the barber.
 PICARD / I... I know. But, I wanted to go riding and I didn't have my saddle, so I came back --
 PICARD / That's right. I left it in the corridor on deck seven. When the power went off, I got lost and didn't know where to go so --
 PICARD / (meekly) Sure, okay. You don't need to point that at me.
 TROI / They haven't tried to communicate with the outside.
 RIKER / No demands, no political statements, no theft... they must want something.
 TROI / Orton is not as calm as he looks. He's very agitated and nervous... as if something's gone wrong.
 DATA / It is possible that Geordi upset their timetable when he saw the hidden weapons.
 RIKER / Orton could be improvising... maybe he didn't plan to take us hostage this early... so now he doesn't know what to do...
 DATA / If they do not have a plan for this contingency, we may have the initiative.
 RIKER / (nods) Maybe, but we have to think of a way to use it...
 RIKER / How's Geordi?
 BEVERLY / There's no permanent damage. I've adjusted the optical transducer in his VISOR to block some of the pain receptors in his brain, but it's only partially effective.
 RIKER / What about Hutchinson?
 BEVERLY / (grim) There was nothing I could do for him. (beat) I still need to get Geordi to a medical facility.
 RIKER / (glances at Orton) I doubt he'll agree to that. (beat) If we told him Geordi was dying he might give us access to a medical kit... maybe we could make a weapon from some of the tools...
 DATA / Perhaps we can use the VISOR as a weapon. If the optical transducer were modified, it may be possible to generate a hypersonic pulse.
 BEVERLY / (understanding) A hypersonic pulse would overload the audio receptors of everyone in the room. It would cause immediate unconsciousness.
 RIKER / (to Beverly) Can you make the adjustments to the VISOR by yourself? It's going to look suspicious if both of you go over there.
 BEVERLY / I'll try... Geordi may have to help me through some of it.
 RIKER / All right... try to keep it casual. Let us know when you're ready.
 PICARD / (firm, into communicator) Kelsey. Don't be a fool. You know better than to try moving that resin.
 PICARD / You may call me whatever you wish, but moving trilithium resin requires very specific equipment. You can't simply improvise something.
 PICARD / I would rather destroy this ship than allow that material to fall into the hands of terrorists.
 PICARD / Trilithium resin is a highly toxic waste material produced by our engines. There's no possible use for it except as a weapon.
 PICARD / (to com) There are only so many ways to Ten Forward... and Ten Forward is the only logical place to go if you want to stay ahead of the Baryon sweep.
 PICARD / (to com) I plan on leaving the same way you do... on your ship.
 PICARD / Come on, Kelsey. If you've been planning this for so long, you must have a way to get off the Enterprise and leave this system. I think there's a ship coming for you. And I plan to be on it.
 PICARD / I'm sorry to hear that... I'll send your regrets.
 RIKER / (normal voice) How is he, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / He's in a lot of pain, but he should be fine. He needs some water.
 BEVERLY / (sotto, quick) We're almost ready. But when we set the VISOR to emit the hypersonic pulse, there'll be a short burst of light. We need a distraction.
 TROI / (sotto) They need a distraction.
 RIKER / How long?
 TROI / A few seconds.
 RIKER / I think I can keep Orton busy for a few seconds.
 TROI / I don't think Orton's in a talking mood, Wil.
 RIKER / You just have to know how to talk to him.
 RIKER / Orton, I think we should discuss this situation.
 RIKER / I think there's a lot to discuss. Can't we be reasonable here?
 RIKER / It won't hurt you to listen, will it?
 RIKER / Thank you. Now the first thing I think we should discuss is this...
 PICARD / He's not dead.
 TROI / I thought you were going to talk with him.
 RIKER / I did. He just didn't like what I had to say.
 DATA / (re: computer panel) That was a perimeter warning from the Remmler Array. A small ship is approaching. (beat as he watches Orton) I believe Mister Orton has just dropped the defense shields.
 RIKER / This has to be what they've been waiting for.
 RIKER / Data, you're going to be the only one unaffected by the hypersonic burst. As soon as everyone's unconscious, you've got to get to the computer panel and stop that ship somehow.
 DATA / I will try, sir.
 PICARD / Kelsey -- perhaps we can work out a deal.
 PICARD / My name's not Mott. It's Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / Leave the trilithium here and take me with you. You can use me as a hostage instead of threatening --
 PICARD / Profit. This is all about profit.
 PICARD / (to com) Arkaria base, this is Captain Picard. Deactivate the baryon sweep. (urgent) This is Captain Picard on the Enterprise. Deactivate the baryon sweep immediately.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to Captain Picard... do you read me Captain?
 PICARD / (keys it) Picard here.
 DATA / Are you all right, Captain?
 PICARD / Yes.
 DATA / Sir, an unidentified scout ship has just beamed someone off the Enterprise. Do you know anything about it?
 PICARD / (beat; low) I know they won't get very far.
 BEVERLY / Hold still... you've got a nasty cut here...
 PICARD / (to Troi, very concerned) Any luck?
 TROI / I'm sorry, Captain. I don't know what could've happened to it.
 RIKER / (shakes his head) I've had three security teams search deck seven and they couldn't find anything.
 BEVERLY / (firm) Hold still. I can't heal this cleanly if you keep fidgeting.
 WORF / I found it, Captain. Someone put it in a maintenance locker.
 PICARD / (takes saddle) Thank you.
 WORF / You keep a saddle on board?
 RIKER / Worf, I'm surprised at you...
 BEVERLY / Any experienced rider would naturally have his own saddle.
 TROI / It's perfectly normal.
 WORF / Of course.
 PICARD / It came in very handy. (beat) I just wish I'd had a chance to use it on a horse.
 PICARD / Good evening, Mister Data.
 DATA / Actually, good morning, sir.
 DATA / Ship status is --
 PICARD / No need to report. I'm just here to do some work of my own.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray at his archaeological site on Landris Two. Please put it through to my Ready Room.
 DATA / I am sorry, sir, but Stellar Cartography has requested a communications blackout while they run an experiment.
 PICARD / How long will it be?
 DATA / Another three hours, twenty-two minutes.
 DATA / I can override it if necessary.
 PICARD / No, no... it's not important.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Computer, display the latest excavation schematics from Landris Two.
 PICARD / Explain.
 PICARD / Tea, Earl Grey. Hot.
 PICARD_COMPUTER VOICE / Stellar Cartography...
 PICARD / (to himself) What could they possibly be doing down there... ?
 WOMAN'S VOICE / In or out, but close that door.
 WOMAN'S VOICE / Just try to stand still.
 WOMAN'S VOICE / It'll take a second for our eyes to re-adjust... (beat; urgent) Elevate to three-point-two. (beat) Good... we can do this... (beat) We're losing vertical alignment. Compensate... (beat) Gently, don't bump it. (beat) No, no -- hit the... (much louder) Forget it. Lights.
 PICARD / You might've taken the simple precaution of locking the door.
 PICARD / You must be Lieutenant Commander Daren.
 PICARD / You're new aboard the Enterprise. I think you'll soon learn to start expecting the unexpected.
 PICARD / Excellent. Now perhaps you could tell me what was so important that it required depriving the ship's Captain of a cup of Earl Grey?
 PICARD / I look forward to sampling them.
 PICARD / (eyeing the console) What are these readings for?
 PICARD / (a wry smile) That's a long time to wait to find out if you're right.
 RIKER, Data and various N.D.s. Picard ENTERS from the / Ready Room.
 RIKER / We'll arrive at the Borgolis Nebula in three hours, sir.
 PICARD / I understand it has unusual radioactive emissions -- I'm sure Stellar Sciences will find it an interesting study.
 RIKER / Commander Daren has already requested time on the main sensor array.
 PICARD / You have the Bridge, Number One.
 DATA / Captain, I would like to remind you about our concert this evening in Ten-Forward. (beat) We will be performing Chopin's Trio in G minor.
 PICARD / (nods) I'll be there.
 PICARD / ... the upshot is... we'll be close enough for you to slip away for a few days and see Wesley.
 BEVERLY / Wonderful, thank you, Jean-Luc.
 BEVERLY / This is delicious; what is it?
 PICARD / It's an herbal tea blend... (beat) I came across it in the replicator files.
 PICARD / Have you met any of the new crewmembers we took on at Starbase Two-eighteen?
 BEVERLY / (nods) In fact, I have a new Nurse. His name's Beck, he's an obstetrics specialist.
 PICARD / (casually) I met the new head of Stellar Sciences last night. Lieutenant Commander Daren.
 BEVERLY / Yes... Nella Daren. She was in Sickbay for a physical last week. I liked her. Very forthright.
 PICARD / Very.
 BEVERLY / Oh, I forgot to tell you... The Exogenics Journal accepted my paper for publication.
 PICARD / (smiles) That's wonderful, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / I'm hoping to get a response from other scientists studying ribosomal replication. There's still no satisfying explanation for the genetic drift.
 PICARD / (smiles) That journal is widely read. You'll probably be swamped with responses. (beat) Did you know it's possible now to predict the configuration of a star system that won't be formed for another two million years?
 BEVERLY / Really? No, I didn't...
 PICARD / It's quite intriguing. It's made possible by a rather complex mathematical construct based on fractal particle motion. And of course that's just the foundation... the modeling itself requires gravimetric wave inputs.
 BEVERLY / I see.
 PICARD / Well, I'm sure it sounds dry. Stellar cartography isn't everyone's cup of tea...
 BEVERLY / I'm sure it's fascinating.
 PICARD / Well... we'd better get to Ten Forward; we don't want to be late for the concert.
 TROI, GEORDI, Riker, Picard and Beverly are sitting / among the N.D.'s waiting for the performance to start. People talk quietly among themselves as they wait.
 PICARD / Your playing was remarkable.
 BEVERLY / You're very talented.
 DATA / I noticed that the applause tonight exceeded average decibel levels.
 PICARD / That was obvious.
 DATA / Excuse me. I have not yet congratulated Ensign Cheney.
 BEVERLY / I'll go with you.
 PICARD / I played piano for a while when I was young. But I never put in the practice time it takes to become truly proficient.
 PICARD / I wanted to ask you... during the second arpeggio in the first movement, I noticed you played an F minor chord instead of a diminished D.
 PICARD / I'm very much an amateur. But I must say, your choice in that arpeggio was delightful. Not at all what one expects to hear.
 RIKER / I'm sorry, the array's been allocated to Engineering; they're running some warp field tests.
 RIKER / I understand that. But we've got other departments waiting to use the array.
 RIKER / (firm) Commander.
 RIKER / I'll see what I can do about more time tomorrow.
 PICARD / End playback.
 PICARD / Come.
 PICARD / (surprised) Commander Daren.
 PICARD / I'm delighted. Come in.
 PICARD / It's Ressikan.
 PICARD / They're not made anymore.
 PICARD / A long time...
 PICARD / I'm not very good.
 PICARD / Yes, but I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else.
 PICARD / You're not holding it quite right...
 PICARD / (dismissing this) Please...
 PICARD / There's... no piano here.
 PICARD / Remarkable... (hoping to get out of this) Why don't you play something for me?
 PICARD / What... shall we play?
 PICARD / Bach... the third Brandenburg.
 PICARD / Sorry...
 PICARD / Just the computer.
 PICARD / Number One... my sparring partner cancelled for this afternoon. I was wondering if you wanted to join me?
 RIKER / Fencing, sir? I'm really not very good.
 PICARD / It doesn't matter... as long as you enjoy it.
 RIKER / Why not?
 PICARD / (pleased) Excellent. Fourteen hundred hours, then.
 BEVERLY / You have a mild strain.
 BEVERLY / The Captain?
 BEVERLY / Yes... but I didn't realize he played... duets.
 BEVERLY / I see.
 BEVERLY / Yes. A long time...
 BEVERLY / I'd say he's a private person... but not isolated.
 BEVERLY / There. That should help.
 BEVERLY / Good.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) Another duet?
 PICARD (O.S.) / Where are we going?
 PICARD / I don't see why we can't just practice in my quarters.
 PICARD / (looking around) The fourth intersect of Jefferies Tube twenty-five.
 PICARD / How did you find it?
 PICARD / Don't tell me you climbed through every tube on the ship?
 PICARD / Just an old folk melody.
 DATA / Geordi. Is there a problem?
 GEORDI / I hear music.
 DATA / Music?
 DATA / I do not hear anything.
 GEORDI / (surprised) Are you sure?
 GEORDI / (frustrated) I know I heard something.
 GEORDI / It's stopped.
 PICARD / I'm told there are nuances only Kerelians can hear -- we don't have the ears for it.
 PICARD / Very good, Commander.
 GEORDI / Commander, we've finished the warp field test.
 RIKER / You brought it in ahead of schedule.
 GEORDI / No problem. We got modulation efficiency up point five percent.
 RIKER / Good work. (to science N.D.) Notify Spectral Analysis they can have an hour on the main sensor array.
 WORF / Captain... (reads off his console) The Federation Outpost on Bersallis Three reports that they are entering a period of fire storm activity.
 PICARD / Is the outpost in any danger?
 WORF / No, sir. The storm is heading for the northern continent, which is not populated.
 GEORDI / Bersallin fire storms come in seven year cycles -- this might be a good chance to study them.
 RIKER / We have two days before our rendezvous with the Havana...
 RIKER / (to helmsman) Helm, set course for Bersallis Three. Warp five.
 PICARD / (standing) Counselor, would you join me in my Ready Room?
 PICARD / You have the Bridge, Number One.
 PICARD / I wanted to talk to you about a matter of... protocol. (beat) I know there are no Starfleet regulations about a Captain becoming involved with a fellow officer, but...
 TROI / You'd like my opinion about you and Commander Daren.
 PICARD / It's that obvious?
 TROI / Obvious in way that pleases people who care about your happiness? Yes, it is.
 PICARD / But I have to be concerned about more than my own happiness.
 TROI / And you think that perhaps your feelings toward Nella could change the way you function as Captain...
 PICARD / Yes. Relationships with coworkers can be fraught with consequences.
 TROI / That's true. But cutting yourself off from your feelings can carry consequences that are just as important.
 PICARD / I've always believed that becoming involved with someone under my command could compromise my objectivity. (beat) And yet...
 TROI / Captain... are you asking my permission?
 PICARD / If I were... would you give it?
 TROI / Yes.
 PICARD / Nella...
 PICARD / I'm sorry about what happened this morning in the Turbolift. (he tries to explain) When that crewman walked in I felt... self-conscious. It might take me a while to get used to the idea of the crew seeing us together.
 PICARD / I promise you... I'm not one for casual relationships.
 PICARD / There's something I want to tell you...
 PICARD / (continuing) But not here...
 PICARD / Do you remember that folk melody I played for you this morning?
 PICARD / I learned it on a planet called Kataan.
 PICARD / I'm not surprised. Its sun went nova over a thousand years ago.
 PICARD / The Enterprise encountered a probe sent from the planet before it was destroyed. The probe scanned me -- I lost consciousness, and in the space of twenty-five minutes... I lived a lifetime there.
 PICARD / I had a wife... children.
 PICARD / It was all very real to me.
 PICARD / (continuing) When I awoke, all that was left of my life there... was the flute I'd taught myself to play.
 PICARD / Because I want you to understand what my music means to me. (beat) And what it means for me to be able to share it with someone.
 RIKER / Quantum Mechanics didn't want to give him up.
 RIKER / How do you know that?
 RIKER / Transfers have to be cleared through me -- before an offer's made.
 RIKER / It's okay. But Fontana should stay where he is.
 RIKER / Commander... do you realize the position you're putting me in?
 RIKER / Look... I'll review the situation and let you know as soon as I can.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Can I have a minute?
 PICARD / Of course. Come in.
 RIKER / It's about Lieutenant Commander Daren... (beat) As a department head, she comes to me about systems allocation, personnel transfers -- things like that.
 RIKER / I have to say, I'm beginning to feel... uncomfortable dealing with her requests.
 PICARD / Because of her relationship with me.
 RIKER / Yes.
 PICARD / Number One... are her requests unusual?
 RIKER / No, sir.
 PICARD / Would you say she's just trying to do her job?
 RIKER / Yes.
 PICARD / Then let her. (beat) And feel free to do yours.
 PICARD / Ship's resources are your responsibility. I've always had complete confidence in your judgment.
 RIKER / Thank you, sir.
 PICARD / It's not that.
 PICARD / Commander Riker came to talk to me this afternoon. (beat) About you.
 PICARD / That's what I told him. But we have to be very careful. Obviously it's easy for people to misunderstand.
 PICARD / All I'm saying is that it's something we have to be aware of. But don't compromise yourself, do what you have to do.
 PICARD / Because if I find out that the head of Stellar Sciences isn't effective anymore, I'll do what I have to do... (smiles) I'll replace her.
 PICARD / I suggest we forget about this and enjoy the evening.
 PICARD / Ah, yes. (he stands) A concoction I first sampled on Thelka Four...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain. Bersallis Three reports that the storm has changed its speed and heading. They are predicting it will hit the outpost within eight hours and are requesting evacuation.
 PICARD / On my way.
 PICARD / Captain's Log, Stardate 46693.1. We have entered the Bersallis star system and are making preparations to evacuate the Federation Outpost on the third planet.
 GEORDI / The fire storms can kick up winds of over two hundred kilometers per hour -- and temperatures as high as three hundred degrees C.
 BEVERLY / Incredible... what causes them?
 BEVERLY / Wasn't the outpost built to withstand the conditions?
 GEORDI / Yes; the structure is reinforced and insulated. But this is no ordinary storm; it's twice as big as any they've ever had. The outpost won't withstand it.
 RIKER / We'll be arriving a little over an hour before the storm hits. (beat) It'll take at least two hours to transport all the colonists off the surface.
 GEORDI / A fire wall...
 GEORDI / It might.
 GEORDI / The storm is approaching the outpost from this direction. (he indicates) If we set up a series of thermal deflector units along the northern perimeter, we could create a fire wall to deflect some of the heat -- the outpost's insulation could probably handle the rest.
 DATA / Thermal deflectors generate a field approximately four hundred meters wide. We would need to cross-connect six units and align them so their fields overlap.
 RIKER / How many people would it take to set it up?
 GEORDI / Twelve, two per team. Cross-connecting that many units will be tricky; once they're set up we'll have to leave them in place and transport our people out -- no one could survive very long outside the outpost.
 PICARD / Let's do it.
 RIKER / The storm's going to interfere with communications -- everything'll have to be coordinated from the surface.
 RIKER / (to Data) Mister Data, you'll coordinate the evacuation of the colonists. (to Beverly) Doctor, they have nine patients in the outpost infirmary. Your priority will be getting them to Sickbay -- after that you'll stay aboard the Enterprise and be ready to receive casualties. (to N.D. officer) Marquez, you'll take some people down to track the storm -- you'll need to keep all teams apprised of its heading. (to Nella) Commander, you'll coordinate the deployment of the deflectors.
 RIKER / Let's go.
 PICARD / Commander Daren... ?
 PICARD / (continuing) About these thermal deflectors...
 PICARD / (continuing) It seems to me that any one of a number of people could coordinate their deployment.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Marquez is already set up on the surface. Apparently the storm is still gaining speed -- he's estimating it'll hit the colony in less than fifty minutes.
 PICARD / Energize.
 WORF, dividing his time between Tactical and Mission / Ops, is assisted by an N.D. stationed at Mission Ops.
 PICARD / How long before the storm reaches the outpost?
 WORF / Seventeen minutes.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Bridge.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / The ionization from the storm is interfering with the transporters. I'm compensating, but it's slowing things down.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Keep at it, Mister La Forge.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Daren.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / You've got less than nine minutes before the storm reaches the northern perimeter.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Whenever you're ready.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Bridge.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / I've just brought aboard the last of the infirmary patients and they're on their way to Sickbay. But we still have over a hundred colonists down there.
 PICARD / Understood, Doctor.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker, here. Go ahead.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / If you stay with the deflectors, will they protect you when the storm hits?
 PICARD / Number One, how many colonists are left to transport?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Seventy three, sir.
 PICARD / How long do you need?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / At least ten more minutes.
 WORF / Captain, the storm will reach the northern perimeter in four minutes.
 PICARD / Picard to perimeter teams.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / ... It is imperative that you hold your positions until we finish the evacuation of the colony. Picard out.
 PICARD / Picard to La Forge.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here.
 PICARD / Keep a signal lock on all perimeter team members.
 GEORDI / Captain, the storm's interference won't --
 PICARD / As soon as the last of the colonists are evacuated I want those perimeter teams out of there. Is that understood?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Yes, sir.
 WORF / The storm has reached the perimeter.
 RIKER / I got out with the last of the colonists. If it hadn't been for the perimeter teams, we wouldn't have made it.
 RIKER / We managed to get four of the teams off the surface. (grim) The interference kept us from getting the other two... I don't see how they could have survived.
 PICARD / Which teams are missing?
 RIKER / Three and six.
 RIKER / The last I knew, Commander Daren was with team six.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Mister Worf.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / We've found survivors, sir.. They're beaming up now.
 PICARD / On my way.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46697.2. Although we succeeded in rescuing all six hundred forty-three Bersallin colonists... we lost eight crewmembers. Let the record show that they gave their lives in the performance of their duty. Commendations will follow.
 PICARD / Nella... you know I had to give that order --
 PICARD / It couldn't have been easy for you... hearing me order you to face death.
 PICARD / Part of you must have... blamed me.
 PICARD / I've lost people under my command... people I cared about deeply... but never someone I've been in love with.
 PICARD / When I thought you were dead, I went into some kind of shutdown... I didn't want to think, I didn't want to feel. I was here, in my quarters, and... the only thing I could focus on was music... and how it would never give me joy again.
 PICARD / We could continue... hoping we wouldn't face a situation like that again... knowing that we might... hoping the pressures on us wouldn't begin to erode our feelings for each other... (beat) That's not what I want for us.
 PICARD / (reluctantly) I don't think we can serve on the same ship.
 PICARD / We can arrange shore leave together.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, Stardate 46731.5. We are in the midst of the Volterra nebula, a stellar "nursery." Our three week mission is a routine analysis of several dozen protostars in various stages of development.
 PICARD, TROI, WORF are at their stations; DATA is at / the aft science station, working his console.
 DATA / Captain, I have completed the spectral evaluation of the outer shell. (beat) Our survey of this protostar is complete.
 PICARD / (to Con) Ensign, lay in a course to the next one, three quarters impulse.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (to COM) Yes, Number One?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / May I see you in the Observation Lounge, Sir?
 PICARD / (to COM) Of course. I'll be right there.
 PICARD / My God...
 PICARD / Professor Galen.
 RIKER / (explains) Professor Galen hailed me from his shuttle an hour ago. He suggested that we surprise you.
 PICARD / No one is more welcome on my ship.
 PICARD / (continuing) I never thought I would see a Kurlan naiskos. (to Galen) Fifth Dynasty?
 PICARD / Please. "Mister" will do just fine.
 PICARD / (continuing) The overall configuration is certainly Fifth Dynasty. But the surface ornamentation...
 PICARD / Green polychrome over the eyes... And the eyes themselves... open. (smiles) Third Dynasty. From the workshop of the Master of Tarquin Hill.
 PICARD / The Master of Tarquin Hill created ceramic designs that were three centuries ahead of his time. We only know him by his work -- his name has never been discovered...
 PICARD / (continuing) This object is over twelve thousand years old...
 RIKER / The planet Kurl? That's a hell of a long way outside Federation territory.
 PICARD / Indeed. I thought you had completed your studies of Kurlan artifacts some time ago.
 PICARD / It's complete?
 PICARD / The Kurl believed every individual is a community of individuals. Inside us are many voices, each with its own desires, its own style, its own way of viewing the world.
 PICARD / (continuing) But Kurlan civilization died out thousands of years ago. It's rare to find a figurine intact. (to the Professor) A truly incredible find.
 PICARD / How could I accept this --
 PICARD / How long can you stay? There's so much to talk about.
 RIKER / The Professor is scheduled to meet a Vulcan transport the day after tomorrow.
 PICARD / Two days? That's not nearly enough time...
 PICARD / I don't understand.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. It has been over thirty years since I last saw my archaeology professor. His presence has taken me back to a time when I had considered a very different career...
 PICARD / Damning with faint praise.
 PICARD / I had hoped to see you there. You said in your last letter that you might go.
 PICARD / Professor Galen, may I ask a frank question?
 PICARD / Your published writings have been... sporadic over the last ten years or so. Your appearances at symposia have been rare -- or scheduled and then cancelled at the last minute. The finest archaeologist of the century has become shrouded with an air of mystery.
 PICARD / (smiles) I've yet to run across anyone that didn't love a good mystery.
 PICARD / Professor, what have you been doing for the last decade?
 PICARD / (nods) Studying fossil records at a microscopic level. I remember reading your papers on the subject. But that was years ago... Then your work seemed to stop.
 PICARD / Tell me --
 PICARD / For how long?
 PICARD / Why can't you do this without me?
 PICARD / Professor, I'm honored that you'd think of me. But I have a responsibility --
 PICARD / May I sleep on it?
 PICARD / "Dream not of today." The night blessing of the Yash-El.
 PICARD / I've had a few years to look it up. (beat) The Enterprise is yours, for as long as you're here.
 PICARD / (continuing) Dream not of today, Professor.
 PICARD / Come.
 BEVERLY / Good morning. (beat) You look like you've been up for awhile.
 PICARD / Yes.
 BEVERLY / (to replicator) One tea, Earl Grey, hot. One macchiato.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Let's hear it...
 PICARD / I had a long talk with Professor Galen last night. He asked me to leave the Enterprise -- to join him on an archaeological expedition that could last a year.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc... that must be tempting.
 PICARD / I wouldn't leave the Enterprise. But the offer itself has made me feel a certain... regret.
 BEVERLY / That you could have been an archaeologist instead of a starship Captain?
 PICARD / Not exactly. I'm certainly not sorry about the path I've taken...
 PICARD / (continuing) But... there's a certain... passion that comes with the singleminded pursuit of the past.
 PICARD / (continuing) To be captured by an image created by another's hand, hundreds or thousands of years ago. A being long dead, who still speaks to you through that image, who says "I was alive, as you are alive."
 PICARD / (continuing) I've only approximated that feeling. Professor Galen made it his life.
 PICARD / (continuing) The Professor didn't choose this figure at random -- the many voices inside the one. He knows that the past is one of the most insistent voices inside me. This gift was meant to remind me of that.
 BEVERLY / And the exploration of space? Surely that counts for something...
 PICARD / I wouldn't trade it for anything. And I'd still make the same decision I made all those years ago. (beat) I'm just sorry I have to say no to him a second time.
 BEVERLY / You two were very close, weren't you?
 PICARD / I had a father. But Professor Galen was like a father who understood me. And he had children -- but none followed in his footsteps. So, I was like the son who understood him.
 BEVERLY / I guess it was difficult for both of you when you left.
 PICARD / The Professor is somewhat... internal. He doesn't express feelings easily. But it was difficult for me.
 PICARD / (continuing) In some ways, I wish he'd never come on board.
 PICARD / Professor.
 PICARD / I'm afraid I won't be going.
 PICARD / (continuing) The Enterprise isn't something I can leave and then come back to. If I go, I go for good. I'm not prepared to do that.
 PICARD / You can't believe that my career in Starfleet has been a mistake.
 PICARD / We both know that isn't true.
 PICARD / I never wanted --
 PICARD / I can't.
 PICARD / You aren't scheduled to rendezvous with the Vulcan ship for two days...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. We have completed our mission in the nebula and are en route to a diplomatic conference on Atalia Seven. I must admit that I have lost my enthusiasm for those proceedings.
 DATA / At present speed, we will arrive at the Atalia system in thirty-seven hours.
 TROI / (quietly) Captain, I'm going for a walk in the arboretum. I wouldn't mind some company.
 WORF / (off instruments) Captain! A distress call from Professor Galen's shuttle. (works controls) Onscreen.
 WORF / Transmission has been blocked.
 PICARD / Locate the call's origin and set course, warp eight.
 DATA / I have located the shuttle. It is under attack, Captain.
 PICARD / Take us out of warp. On screen.
 WORF / A Yridian destroyer.
 RIKER / Battle stations.
 WORF / Aye.
 DATA / Professor Galen is still inside his vessel. (looks up) His vital signs are barely registering.
 PICARD / Get him out of there.
 WORF / The shuttle is within a tractor beam -- the Transporter cannot penetrate it.
 RIKER / Hail the Yridians.
 WORF / (works console) They are not responding.
 PICARD / Return phaser fire, disable their offensive systems.
 RIKER / Worf?
 WORF / I don't understand, Commander. The phaser blast was not powerful enough to destroy the ship.
 DATA / The Yridian vessel was overloading its power generators. That, combined with the phaser blast, caused it to explode.
 PICARD / (to COM) Transporter Room One, lock onto Professor Galen and transport him directly to Sickbay...
 BEVERLY / (to Picard; sotto) He took a disruptor hit point blank. There's nothing I can do.
 GEORDI / I'd say at least three Yridians boarded the Professor's shuttle.
 PICARD / What were they after?
 GEORDI / We're not sure, but it looked like they were trying to download something from his computer.
 DATA / When he was attacked, Professor Galen began to protect certain files in his computer memory.
 GEORDI / We were able to do a partial (TECH)-reconstruction on the shuttle computer, so we have at least some of those files.
 GEORDI / We found nineteen different blocks of numbers like this one.
 PICARD / What do they mean?
 DATA / They could mean almost anything. Unless we can narrow the parameters of the search, it would be impossible for the computer to identify the patterns with any accuracy.
 GEORDI / We tried every decryption key on record -- in case Professor Galen was using some kind of code. (indicates screen) We still can't make heads or tails of them.
 WORF / Were the Yridians able to get these number blocks?
 GEORDI / At least some of them. It's hard to say how many.
 PICARD / Apparently, the Yridians knew more about the Professor's work than we do. (re: Viewscreen) They may have known what these numbers mean.
 GEORDI / If they did, that knowledge died with them.
 PICARD / Not necessarily. The Yridians are information dealers. They could have been delivering the number blocks to someone else. Did they send any signals before they were destroyed?
 WORF / We detected no transmissions.
 GEORDI / There weren't any vessels in the immediate area.
 PICARD / Do the shuttle's flight logs show where Galen had been before coming on board the Enterprise?
 DATA / (nodding) The logs indicate that Professor Galen visited an unexplored star system -- Ruah Four.
 PICARD / What's the distance from our current position?
 DATA / Four days at warp six.
 PICARD / The conference can wait. (beat) Lay in a course to the Ruah system.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Troi and the Ensign at the CONN. The Viewscreen displays the blue-green planet. / 
 RIKER / (to Ensign) Standard orbit, Ensign.
 DATA / (off instruments) Ruah Four is an M class planet. Sixty-seven percent of the surface is covered with water. The landmass contains multiple animal species, including a genus of proto-hominids.
 PICARD / (beat) Scan for any evidence of monuments or earth works which might suggest an ancient civilization.
 DATA / (works) There is nothing to indicate former occupancy by even a primitive culture, sir.
 PICARD / Then what was the most renowned archaeologist in the Federation doing here?
 PICARD / When he left the Enterprise, he was going to take a Vulcan ship to Deep Space Four. And from there... (trying to recall) An Al-Leyan transport as far as Caere... Then the shuttle to... Indri Eight.
 PICARD / Mister Data, what do we know about Indri Eight?
 DATA / The Indri system was first identified by Federation vessels nearly sixty years ago. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / The eighth planet is L-class, covered by deciduous vegetation... unexplored, but with no apparent evidence of civilization, present or past. In fact, the planet possesses no animal life whatsoever.
 PICARD / Number One, we'll proceed to Indri Eight.
 RIKER / Sir, with all due respect... we've run into one dead end... and it doesn't sound like Indri Eight is any more promising. We're already late for the conference on Atalia Seven...
 PICARD / (sharply) I know Starfleet's timetable. (beat; indicates screen) Professor Galen visited this planet only days ago. And he was headed to Indri Eight when he was killed. There is a connection between the two planets. And I'm going to find it.
 RIKER / Aye, Sir.
 RIKER / (to CONN) Lay in a course, Ensign. Warp seven.
 PICARD / Come.
 TROI / How's it going?
 PICARD / It's not. (indicates screen) I thought if I stared at these number blocks long enough I might start to see some kind of pattern.
 PICARD / (re: screen) Nothing.
 TROI / What I really meant was -- how's it going with you?
 PICARD / As well as can be expected, given the circumstances.
 PICARD / If I had only gone with him --
 TROI / ... You might both be dead. Captain, you can't start thinking like that. You didn't abandon him. You chose not to abandon a life-long career. It was the right decision. And it was in no way responsible for his death.
 PICARD / Yes, I realize that.
 TROI / (gently) I know how much the Professor meant to you... and how much you want to find out what happened... but staring at these numbers isn't going to bring him back. (beat) The conference on Atalia Seven has been scheduled for six months. Starfleet is relying on your mediation efforts to --
 PICARD / Counselor, this isn't a case of my taking the Enterprise and its crew on some wild goose chase in order to purge myself of guilt or remorse. (beat) I simply will not allow Galen's death to be in vain. If that means inconveniencing a group of squabbling delegates for a few more days, then so be it. The responsibility is mine.
 TROI / Captain.
 WORF / We are in range of the planet.
 RIKER / Riker to Picard... we're approaching Indri Eight.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / On my way.
 DATA / Sensors are picking up severe atmospheric fluctuations on the planet...
 RIKER / Assume a high orbit.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, onscreen.
 WORF / (off instruments) Some kind of plasma reaction is consuming the lower atmosphere.
 PICARD / Can we stop it?
 WORF / No, Sir. The reaction is global...
 DATA / All life on the planet is being destroyed.
 RIKER / Why would anyone want to destroy all the life on an uninhabited, neutral planet with no strategic importance whatsoever?
 PICARD / All the life... (beat then to others) What if the Professor's number blocks have something to do with organic material?
 DATA / Narrowing the search parameters to the biological database would increase the chances that the computer could find a match.
 PICARD / (on the move) I'll be in the lab.
 BEVERLY / Specify.
 PICARD / (reacts, amazed) DNA fragments!
 BEVERLY / (off screen) Each from a different lifeform... from nineteen different worlds.
 PICARD / The planets these fragments come from are scattered across the quadrant. No wonder it took the Professor years to collect them. But why?
 BEVERLY / (excited) Wait a minute. These fragments all have similar protein configurations... they could be chemically compatible.
 PICARD / How can that be possible? They're different species... from different planets. There shouldn't be any compatibility at all.
 BEVERLY / I know, but look at the base pair combinations, they're uniform. (beat) If I'm right... (beat) Computer, connect the DNA fragments according to protein-link compatibility.
 PICARD / (amazed) What is it?
 BEVERLY / I have no idea...
 GEORDI / (indicating genetic shape on screen) This is not a natural design. Captain, this is part of an algorithm... coded at the molecular level.
 PICARD / An algorithm? Are you saying these DNA fragments are elements of some kind of computer program?
 GEORDI / I know how it sounds, but there's no way this could be a random formation. It's definitely part of a program.
 BEVERLY / (beat) This fragment has been part of every DNA strand on Earth since life began there... and the other fragments are just as old. (beat) Someone would've had to write this program over four billion years ago.
 PICARD / So four billion years ago, someone scattered this genetic material into the primordial soup of at least nineteen different planets across the galaxy.
 DATA / The genetic information must have been incorporated into the earliest lifeforms on those planets, and then passed down through each generation.
 BEVERLY / But why would anyone do it in the first place?
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Do you have any idea what this program could be designed to do?
 GEORDI / We couldn't know that until we assembled the entire program and ran it.
 GEORDI / There are several fragments still missing. We've tried all the DNA material in Federation records, but we can't find any with compatible protein configurations.
 PICARD / Then they must be from worlds outside the Federation. (beat) How many people aboard the Enterprise come from non-Federation planets?
 DATA / Seventeen.
 PICARD / It may be a long shot, but we ought to check each of those seventeen people to see if any of them have the correct protein configurations.
 BEVERLY / I'll begin taking DNA samples.
 GEORDI / You know Captain... I've been thinking. Someone else must know about this program.
 GEORDI / I bet one of the missing fragments was on Indri Eight... and that's why it was destroyed --
 PICARD / To keep anyone else from getting that piece of the puzzle.
 PICARD / It's four billion years old... a computer program from a highly advanced civilization... hidden in the fabric of life itself. (beat) Whatever information is contained in that program could be the most profound discovery of our time. Or the most dangerous. And the Professor knew that.
 BEVERLY / (to Crewmember) That's it. Thank you. (to Mott) You're next, Mister Mott.
 BEVERLY / Nothing. I'm just going to sample some of your skin cells.
 BEVERLY / About as much as that pedicure you gave me last week.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) Relax. You won't feel a thing.
 BEVERLY / (hopeful) That might be it.
 BEVERLY / Let's see if it fits into the program.
 BEVERLY / Close... but no.
 BEVERLY / (firm) Thank you, Mister Mott. That'll be all.
 BEVERLY / They all came up negative.
 PICARD / I've gone through every page of the Professor's published work... hoping I'd find a clue about where to go next... but so far nothing.
 BEVERLY / Maybe we've been at this too long. Why don't we both get some sleep and start again in the morning.
 PICARD / (remembering) "I was in the neighborhood."
 PICARD / (continuing) When I asked the Professor what took him all the way to Kurl, he said he was "in the neighborhood." Doing what?
 BEVERLY / Collecting a DNA sample, perhaps...
 PICARD / The only planet near the Kurlan system capable of supporting life is Loren Three.
 BEVERLY / There's no Loren Three sample in the data we downloaded from the Professor's shuttle. If he did get one from there it must have been taken by the Yridians when they attacked.
 PICARD / (to COM) Mister Data, set course for Loren Three, maximum warp.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Yes, Sir.
 DATA / We are approaching the Loren system.
 RIKER / Slow to half impulse, and take us into orbit above the third planet.
 PICARD / There's a good chance our competition has gotten here first. Battle stations, Mister Worf.
 WORF / (works console) Aye.
 DATA / We are entering orbit..
 RIKER / (re: Viewscreen) You were right, Captain, we've got company.
 RIKER / (continuing) Cardassians.
 WORF / They are hailing us.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / (to screen) I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. And I fail to see why I should explain my presence to you. Cardassia has no claims on this sector.
 PICARD / Not at all. But the Enterprise is on a purely scientific mission. You have nothing to gain by interfering with us.
 WORF / Captain, a Klingon attack cruiser is decloaking off the starboard bow! (beat) They are hailing us.
 WORF / Captain, a Bird of Prey is decloaking off starboard! (beat) They are hailing us.
 PICARD (V. O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. It seems that we have not one, but two competitors in our attempt to complete Professor Galen's puzzle. I have prevailed upon the Cardassian and Klingon Captains to meet with me.
 PICARD / I believe we all know why we're here. If we admit that much, we can move forward.
 PICARD / There's no point in trying to deceive each other... we all know about Professor Galen's research and about the computer program which is composed of DNA fragments.
 PICARD / I'll take your silence as confirmation. Now, it stands to reason that no one has all the DNA fragments necessary to complete the program. (to Cardassian) You were the first to arrive in this system. Do you have an organic sample from the planet below?
 PICARD / (ignoring him) I believe one of you also has a fragment from Indri Eight.
 PICARD / He destroyed the planet's biosphere after taking the sample.
 PICARD / All of us are missing some of the fragments... but not necessarily the same ones. Unless we combine what we have, we'll never learn the secret of this program.
 PICARD / Until we assemble the entire program no on can know its ultimate purpose.
 PICARD / Enough. Without cooperation we will get nowhere.
 PICARD / If you both bring the fragments you possess to the Enterprise, I will combine them with ours. The result will be observed by all parties simultaneously, giving no one the advantage.
 PICARD / Then this endeavor stops dead, right here in this room.
 DATA / (to Klingon) Captain.
 BEVERLY / There's still one missing piece...
 PICARD / And I think we're very close, indeed.
 PICARD / This is a... jigsaw puzzle... whose pieces have been scattered across the galaxy. (beat) Doesn't it seem reasonable to assume that the original designers meant for someone to find this puzzle -- why else would they put the pieces in our DNA? (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) And doesn't that in turn suggest that they would try to make it easy for us to find all the pieces? That there might be some... pattern to their distribution?
 BEVERLY / If that's so... our computer might be able to find that pattern.
 PICARD / Doctor, program the computer to analyze the distribution pattern of the pieces we have, correcting for changes in star configurations over four billion years... and extrapolate for the missing piece.
 BEVERLY / That'll take me a while to set up... and a few hours more to process.
 PICARD / If you wish, you may stay on board while we wait.
 DATA / Hello, Captain.
 DATA / The computer is processing the data. I will be notified as soon as there is any information.
 DATA / I am familiar with many Klingon rituals -- including the B'aht Qul.
 DATA / (in explanation) My upper spinal support is a polyalloy designed for extreme stress. My skull is composed of cortenide and duranium.
 DATA / You are attempting to bribe me.
 DATA / You suggested a plan that would work to your advantage, one that I would be capable of executing. You then implied a reward. Clearly --
 GEORDI / (puzzled) What's this?
 GEORDI / (to computer) Computer, perform a level three diagnostic on the primary defensive systems...
 GEORDI / (to COM) La Forge to Captain Picard...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / What is it, Geordi?
 GEORDI / (to COM) You might want to come down here, sir. I found something... you should see.
 DATA / The computer has completed its analysis.
 BEVERLY / The computer was able to extrapolate this geometric pattern based on the distribution of the fragments.
 BEVERLY / Computer, highlight the missing section of the pattern.
 BEVERLY / (indicates section) The missing DNA fragment should be in this system.
 DATA / (reading screen) That star is in sector two-one-four-five-nine. (beat) The Rahm-Izad system.
 WORF / Direct hit on our port nacelle.
 WORF / (continuing) They are powering for another volley.
 RIKER / Let's make it look good. Ensign, release the inertial dampers.
 WORF / They are firing...
 PICARD / Report, Number One.
 RIKER / The power boost to the structural integrity field protected the nacelles. We used the inertial dampers to simulate a complete shield failure.
 WORF / (off instruments) The Cardassian vessels have set a course for Rahm-Izad.
 PICARD / It's not going to take them very long to realize that Rahm-Izad is the wrong planet. (to Nu'Daq) You're welcome to join us, Captain.
 PICARD / Ensign, plot a course to the Vilmoran System. Warp nine.
 RIKER / Take us out of warp.
 DATA / (off console) I am scanning all seven planets in the Vilmoran system -- none appears to support life.
 RIKER / How could that be? The Professor's data depends on --
 DATA / (off console) ...Correction. The second planet shows evidence of an ancient ocean, now dry.
 GEORDI / It once supported life.
 DATA / Yes. And it still may, in a limited fashion not detectable by our long range sensors.
 RIKER / Ensign, lay in a course, full impulse.
 RIKER / (to COM) Riker to Transporter Room One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (continuing) We've located a planet that may still support life. We'll know in a minute.
 PICARD / Any sign of the Cardassians?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Not yet. But I don't know how long it'll stay that way.
 PICARD / (to COM) Acknowledged.
 DATA / (off instruments) I am reading a small pocket of vegetative life -- a primitive lichen growing in a fossilized seabed.
 RIKER / (to COM) Transporter Room One -- I'm programming the coordinates. Stand-by.
 BEVERLY / There.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Captain, we've got company. I'm ready to pull you out of there.
 PICARD / (touches COM) Wait for my order, Number One.
 PICARD / You've been shadowing us ever since.
 PICARD / (sotto) The seabed... it may be only partially fossilized... it could still contain organic material.
 PICARD / (to Beverly, sotto) The program has activated... (beat) I think it's reconfiguring the tricorder... it's modifying the emitter diode to project something...
 PICARD / (touches COM) Picard to Enterprise. Away Team is ready to beam up.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 PICARD (V. O. / Captain's log, Stardate 46735.2. Our frequent use of high warp over the last few days has overextended the propulsion systems. We are finishing minor repairs before returning to Federation territory.
 BEVERLY / It's a shame Professor Galen wasn't able to see the end result of his search...
 PICARD / I don't know of anyone who would have appreciated it more.
 BEVERLY / If it hadn't been for you, Jean-Luc, his dream to solve that puzzle would never have been realized. You gave him a wonderful legacy...
 PICARD / It would've been a more fitting legacy if the message had not fallen on deaf ears.
 BEVERLY / You never know.
 BEVERLY / I have to get this day started.
 PICARD / Both of us.
 BEVERLY / See you this afternoon.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain Picard. Incoming transmission from the Romulan command ship.
 PICARD / (to COM) Put it through.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 PICARD / Until then.
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / One day...
 RIKER / (to Doctor) You're absolutely right, Doctor. In fact, right now it's hard to imagine ever hurting anyone...
 RIKER / I feel... terrible. But thanks to you, I'm much better now. And I feel confident that when I leave, I'll be ready to take my place in society again.
 RIKER / Well... now. Right away.
 RIKER / You said when I was able to accept what I'd done, and understood the consequences of my actions, that I'd be free to go.
 RIKER / I'm looking forward to proving my innocence...
 RIKER / But that's not what I meant. I... I meant that I was sick when it happened. I wasn't responsible for what I did...
 RIKER / No. I want to talk about it now...
 RIKER / What I need is to get out of this cell. I'm locked up day and night... you control every move... tell me what to eat, what to think, what to say...
 RIKER / (continuing) And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a "treatment."
 RIKER / You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'm not insane. And I won't let you or anyone... me think I am....
 RIKER / I won't let you or anyone think that...
 RIKER / I'm sorry. Can we take it from "You're becoming agitated"?
 to REVEAL that we have been in the ship's THEATER. A cell is set up on a stage. The theater seats are empty, except for BEVERLY, who is directing the play. DATA -- who is playing the Doctor -- is also on the / cell stage.
 BEVERLY / (to all) Why don't we break for tonight. I think we've made a lot of progress.
 RIKER / But I'm still not confident about that final speech...
 BEVERLY / There's such a thing as over-rehearsing, Wil. You'll do just fine. (beat) Try to relax. You're resisting the character. Let yourself feel what he's feeling.
 RIKER / (unsure) Maybe I'm just not right for this part...
 DATA / (to Riker) Most humanoids have the potential to be irrational. Perhaps you should attempt to access that part of your psyche.
 BEVERLY / Haven't you ever felt at odds with everyone -- like the whole world was against you?
 RIKER / Yeah... my first year at the Academy...
 BEVERLY / Try to tap into that feeling. That's what your character is going through in this scene.
 RIKER / I'll work on it...
 BEVERLY / It'll be wonderful. You're going to knock 'em dead.
 RIKER / "You control every move... tell me what to eat, what to think, what to say... "
 RIKER / (continuing) "What to eat, what to think, what to say... " (beat) "And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a 'treatment'... "
 RIKER / (continuing) "I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'm not insane --"
 RIKER / Excuse me...
 RIKER / (surprised) Tilonus Four? Didn't their government just collapse?
 PICARD / (nods) It's in a state of total anarchy. When the Prime Minister was assassinated, a Federation research team was on the planet. It is believed they were forced to go into hiding... (beat) Your mission will be to locate and evacuate them.
 RIKER / Can't they go to local authorities?
 PICARD / There are no local authorities. The government's been splintered -- several factions are vying for power. And they're desperate for weapons or technology of any kind... (beat) Apparently, some factions are resorting to torture to gather information. A Starfleet research team would be a prime target.
 RIKER / Then I'll have to go alone... undercover.
 PICARD / Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to give you a detailed briefing on Tilonian culture.
 RIKER / (smiles) Looks like I'll have to back out of Doctor Crusher's play after all...
 PICARD / No, no... you'll have plenty of time for that, Number One. We won't be arriving at Tilonus for another five days. (beat) Besides, if you back out now, Beverly will come after me to play the part.
 WORF / This is the last known location of the research team. They had occupied a small building in the Southwest quarter of the city. You will begin your search there.
 RIKER / The Southwest quarter covers over two hundred square kilometers. That's a lot of ground for one man to cover... (lightly) I'd better pack an extra pair of boots.
 WORF / (re: clothing) This apparel will allow you to pass as a common merchant.
 WORF / (re: pendant) This Tilonian pendant has been equipped with a communicator circuit.
 RIKER / (with humor) It doesn't really match the outfit...
 WORF / I suggest you pay closer attention, Commander. Your life will be at stake.
 WORF / (hard) Do you understand what I am saying?
 RIKER / (an edge) Yes... of course I do...
 WORF / (re: knife) Because you will be posing as a merchant, you will need to know how to use the Nisroh for the traditional bartering ceremony.
 WORF / (continuing) You will be judged on your prowess with the blade...
 WORF / I am sorry, Commander! I did not intend --
 RIKER / That's okay, that's okay...
 RIKER / (continuing) I guess I really wasn't paying attention... (beat) I'd better get to Sickbay. We'll pick this up later.
 WORF / Aye sir...
 BEVERLY / (with humor) You'll do anything to get out of this play, won't you? (beat) Well, you're going to have to do better than this...
 RIKER / The play's tomorrow night. I've still got twenty-four hours left.
 BEVERLY / Don't get any ideas. I'll expect you on stage at eighteen hundred hours.
 RIKER / Right...
 RIKER / (re: his head) It still hurts...
 BEVERLY / There's no nerve damage... you shouldn't be feeling any pain.
 RIKER / Probably just a symptom of stage fright --
 GEORDI / (re: wounded N.D.) He was working on a conduit on Deck Thirty-seven. A plasma torch blew up in his hands...
 RIKER / I've been on a lot of missions... and I've seen a lot of people get injured... (beat) But I've never been affected like this...
 RIKER / (continuing) He was looking right at me.
 TROI / And that was disturbing to you...
 RIKER / It was like he was... blaming me or something. But it's more than just this one incident. For the past few days, I've been feeling like everyone's staring at me... or talking about me... (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (lightly) I feel like I'm in "Frame of Mind"...
 TROI / "Frame of Mind"?
 RIKER / Doctor Crusher's play. Ever since I started rehearsing the role, I've been feeling a little restless... uneasy...
 TROI / You're probably drawing on feelings that you're not used to expressing...
 RIKER / Yeah. The play is full of disturbing images. People losing their minds... being tortured by doctors... (beat) I can't get it out of my head...
 TROI / Sometimes it's healthy to explore the darker sides of the psyche. Jung called it "owning your own shadow." (beat) This could be a sign that you're a real actor, Wil. It's becoming more than just a role to you.
 RIKER / Maybe you're right...
 TROI / Don't be afraid of your darker side. Have fun with it.
 RIKER / (re: Lieutenant) Who is that?
 RIKER / (continuing) You just missed him. (beat) Do we have a new Lieutenant on board?
 TROI / I'm not sure. Do you want me to check the personnel logs?
 RIKER / No... I'll check them tomorrow... (beat) I think I'll get to bed early. Tomorrow's the performance and I want to be up for it.
 TROI / I'm looking forward to it. (beat) Break a leg.
 RIKER / I'll try not to take that literally.
 DATA_DOCTOR / (doubtful) Perhaps we should continue this discussion next week...
 RIKER / No. I want to talk about it now...
 DATA_DOCTOR / (calmly) You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you need another treatment...
 RIKER / What I need is to get out of this cell. I'm locked up day and night... you control every move... tell me what to eat, what to think, what to say...
 RIKER / (continuing) And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a "treatment."
 RIKER / You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'm not insane. And I won't let you or anyone else tell me I am.
 RIKER / (continuing) You can destroy my mind, but you can't change the truth. I didn't kill that man. (beat) And that's what's driving you crazy...
 DATA_DOCTOR / I can see we have a lot of work to do.
 RIKER / No matter what you do, you can't change the fact that I'm innocent! (beat) I'm not crazy!
 RIKER / (to himself) I'm not crazy...
 RIKER / (doubtful) I'm... not... (beat) ...crazy.
 RIKER / Where am I? (beat) How did you get me off the ship?
 RIKER / What's going on?
 RIKER / I was on the Enterprise. In the middle of a play... (looks around) Here... but it wasn't real... it was a stage...
 RIKER / I'm Commander... (beat) Commander...
 RIKER / (continuing) I knew who I was a second ago... I was on the ship... in a play... (beat) It's getting harder to remember...
 RIKER / (reacts) Delusion... it couldn't be a delusion. I was there...
 RIKER / No...
 RIKER / (chiming in) ... Starbase Twenty-nine.
 RIKER / He said he'd never heard of me... that they had no officer matching my description...
 RIKER / I'm not sure...
 RIKER / I hurt my head... somebody hit me...
 RIKER / Yes... now I do. But at first, I thought a Klingon cut me... with a knife...
 RIKER / If what you're saying is true... where am I?
 RIKER / Why am I here?
 RIKER / Wait...
 RIKER / (to com) I guess so...
 RIKER / (re: guard) There's no need for this.
 RIKER / (hopeful) You have?
 RIKER / I'm not that far gone, am I?
 RIKER / No...
 RIKER / Your name -- it's Mav... Mavek.
 RIKER / I'm starting to remember certain things, but... (beat) Why am I here?
 RIKER / (reacts) Blood?
 RIKER / What are you talking about? I didn't kill anybody.
 RIKER / No. It's not true...
 RIKER / (yells) You're lying!
 RIKER / NO!
 RIKER / (to Beverly) I was there... in Ward Forty-seven, just like in the play. Everyone thought I was insane... that I'd killed somebody... (beat) Except it was all real.
 BEVERLY / Deanna mentioned you went to bed early because you felt a little anxious about the play. But I had no idea...
 BEVERLY / You said that in your dream we performed the play... (beat) How'd it go?
 RIKER / It was a smash. We got a standing ovation.
 BEVERLY / Let's hope it goes that well tonight.
 BEVERLY / We've got one hour to curtain. How do you feel?
 RIKER / I feel... like an actor.
 BEVERLY / You're certainly starting to look the part.
 DATA_DOCTOR / (doubtful) Perhaps we should continue this discussion next week...
 RIKER / No. I want to talk about it now...
 DATA_DOCTOR / You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you need another treatment...
 RIKER / What I need is to get out of this cell. I'm locked up day and night... you control my every move...
 RIKER / (distracted) You tell me what to eat... what to think... what to say...
 BEVERLY / (whispers) "And when I show a glimmer of independent thought... "
 RIKER / And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a "treatment."
 DATA_DOCTOR / You're becoming agitated...
 RIKER / You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'm not insane. And I won't let you or anyone else tell me...
 RIKER / (to himself) What's happening...
 DATA_DOCTOR / I can see we have a lot of work to do.
 RIKER / No matter what you do, you can't change the fact that I'm innocent...
 RIKER / (to Lieutenant) You're the key to all this, aren't you? Who are you?
 RIKER / Who are you?
 BEVERLY / Wil... are you alright?
 RIKER / No... I don't know...
 BEVERLY / Why don't we go down to Sickbay...
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) There's nothing wrong with you neurologically. I don't see anything that could've caused your hallucinations. (beat) But your heart rate is up... blood pressure's way above normal. You're physically exhausted.
 RIKER / This is more than just fatigue...
 BEVERLY / It's possible under conditions of extreme stress for the mind to manufacture all kinds of things.
 RIKER / Drugs. They injected me with me drugs... (to Beverly) Are there drugs in my system?
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) Nothing.
 RIKER / It's that dream... they gave me drugs in the dream... (beat) (MORE)
 RIKER / (continuing) Did anybody in the theater see anything strange happen during the performance?
 BEVERLY / No... nobody.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Get some rest, Wil. The play is over. Don't give it another thought.
 RIKER / Thanks...
 RIKER / How's Lieutenant Suna?
 TROI / A little shaken... but alright.
 RIKER / I feel like such an idiot.
 TROI / It's nothing to be embarrassed about. We're your friends... We all know the stress you've been under. I'm sure everyone understands perfectly...
 DATA / (to Riker) Commander, I must compliment you on your performance this evening.
 RIKER / Oh?
 DATA / Your unexpected choice to improvise was an effective method of drawing the audience into the plight of your character. (beat) You gave a truly realistic interpretation of multi-infarct dementia.
 RIKER / Thank you.
 TROI / (with humor) Well... maybe not everyone understands.
 RIKER / I guess all I need is a little rest... clear my mind a little...
 TROI (O.S.) / I want you to try a few relaxation techniques, as well. Remember the ones I showed you a few months ago?
 RIKER / Yeah... but they didn't seem to work for me.
 TROI / What's wrong?
 RIKER / Nothing... nothing...
 TROI / (gentle) Get some sleep, Wil. I'll see you tomorrow.
 RIKER / (quietly) It's not real... not real...
 RIKER / No... NO! Let me out of here!
 RIKER / No! Let me out of here! Help me...
 RIKER / I need help. I don't want to be at the mercy of these hallucinations any more.
 RIKER / All I know is that whenever I go back to the ship, reality starts to break apart... nothing makes sense. And when it's over, it fades away... like a dream... (beat) But the hospital... everything here seems real. I can always remember what happens here...
 RIKER / Maybe I did kill someone. I don't know. But I want to find out.
 RIKER / Meaning?
 RIKER / What does that mean?
 RIKER / Reflection Therapy?
 RIKER / What's the other option?
 RIKER / Surgery?
 RIKER / You don't seem to like that option.
 RIKER / Option one is starting to sound better...
 RIKER / Reflection Therapy then... when do we start?
 RIKER / I was... afraid...
 TROI (O.S.) / Terrified...
 RIKER / (re: Troi) She was on the ship with me...
 RIKER / Why her?
 RIKER / (to Troi) You said I was terrified... of what?
 TROI / I was in a dark place... cold... frightened... someone was there...
 RIKER / Who?
 TROI / I felt threatened by them... trapped...
 WORF / I was angry. They were attacking me... I fought back...
 TROI / I felt pain...
 WORF / I was injured...
 TROI / I began to panic...
 WORF / There was a struggle... and I...
 RIKER / You what? What happened?
 PICARD / It was dark and cold because... I was outdoors... at night... in a narrow space... (thinks) I was walking through an alley.
 TROI / I felt threatened...
 WORF / I was being watched...
 PICARD / Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why I started to walk faster. Then someone grabbed me from behind...
 TROI / I panicked...
 WORF / I tried to fight them off...
 RIKER / How many of them were there?
 PICARD / Three. They were humanoid. I could only make out one of their faces...
 RIKER / Who was it?
 RIKER / (re: Lieutenant) He was on the ship too... and I saw him here in the hospital... but I don't know who he is...
 RIKER / What part of me does he represent?
 TROI / Don't believe this, Wil. (indicates room) None of it is real. You're still with us... on the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Doctor...
 PICARD / We're your colleagues. Trust us. It's going to be alright...
 RIKER / (to crew) You're just... delusions...
 WORF / (re: Doctor) Do not listen to him, Commander. He is trying to trick you. You are in danger here. Let us help you...
 RIKER / Stop it... please. Leave me alone...
 TROI / Listen to me, Wil. In all the years we've known each other, have I ever lied to you?
 RIKER / (a shout) You are not real!
 PICARD / Wil, please --
 RIKER / NO!
 RIKER / (to himself) It's not real...
 BEVERLY / (to Riker) Commander... do you know who I am?
 BEVERLY / Do you know where you are? (no response) If you can't answer, just listen. You were on an undercover mission to Tilonus Four... something happened... we've been told that you killed someone. But we don't believe that's true...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We've been in orbit, trying to find a way to get you out. But there's a security field around the hospital that we can't penetrate...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We've been blocked at every turn. The hospital Administrator denies you're here at all. It's beginning to look like some kind of a conspiracy... (beat) I had to come in posing as a health official...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Sit tight. We're going to get you out of here.
 RIKER / (quiet) Not real...
 DATA / (whispers) Commander.
 RIKER / Get away from me...
 WORF / Commander, you must come with us. You are in danger here...
 RIKER / (louder) No.
 WORF / Silence...
 DATA / Commander, are you --
 RIKER / (calls out) Help me! HELP ME!
 WORF / (taps communicator) Worf to Enterprise -- the pattern enhancer has been activated. Three to beam up.
 BEVERLY / (to Picard, off tricorder) There's damage to his parietal lobe. It's as if someone was trying to access his long term memory...
 BEVERLY / (re: Riker) He's still in a state of severe neural shock. It'll take him a while to recover...
 PICARD / (gentle) Number One... do you remember what happened?
 PICARD / (continuing) You were abducted during your mission to Tilonus Four. You were taken to a psychiatric hospital...
 RIKER / My head... why is it still bleeding?
 BEVERLY / It's minor. Nothing to worry about...
 PICARD / (to Riker) We've done some checking on the hospital Administrator...
 RIKER / ... Mister Suna...
 PICARD / That's right. It appears he's involved with one of the rival factions. We believe he was responsible for what happened to you...
 RIKER / (re: head) It still hurts...
 RIKER / It's bleeding again... (to Beverly) But how? You just healed it...
 BEVERLY / Wil, try to calm down...
 RIKER / This isn't real...
 PICARD / Wil, what are you doing?
 RIKER / If I'm right, you're not really here... and this isn't a real phaser... (beat) It's all a fantasy, and I'm ending it no matter what it takes...
 PICARD / But what if this isn't a fantasy? Are you willing to take that chance?
 RIKER / You're right... I won't. But I've got to find out what's real and what's not...
 RIKER / One way or another, this is going to end.
 BEVERLY / Wil, don't -- !
 AS THE ENTIRE ROOM SHATTERS LIKE BREAKING GLASS AROUND RIKER -- "REALITY" BREAKING APART -- THE SCENE / SPLINTERING AWAY TO REVEAL:
 RIKER / I still have the phaser... why do I still have the phaser?
 RIKER / I don't believe you --
 RIKER / (re: phaser) If this is a knife... what happened to Mavek?
 RIKER / No. If I'm really holding a phaser, then that means I was on the Enterprise...
 RIKER / But I fired this at myself on the Enterprise. I should be dead right now...
 RIKER / None of this is real --
 RIKER / I'm setting this to Level Sixteen, wide field. That should destroy half of this building... (beat) Unless, of course, it isn't a real phaser.
 AS THE ENTIRE ROOM SHATTERS LIKE BREAKING GLASS AROUND RIKER AND THE ALIEN ADMINISTRATOR_LIEUTENANT -- / "REALITY" BREAKING APART -- THE SCENE SPLINTERING AWAY TO REVEAL:
 RIKER / It's all about you, isn't it? You're the only constant... the only person in both places...
 RIKER / None of this is real, either... (beat) What's happening to me?
 RIKER / You're lying...
 RIKER / (yells) No!
 RIKER / No!
 AS EVERYTHING SHATTERS LIKE BREAKING GLASS, INCLUDING RIKER AND THE ADMINISTRATOR_LIEUTENANT -- "REALITY" / BREAKING APART ONE FINAL TIME TO REVEAL:
 RIKER / (taps pendant) Riker to Enterprise!
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Enterprise here. Are you alright, sir?
 RIKER / Emergency transport -- get me out of here!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46778.1. Commander Riker has returned safely from his mission to Tilonus Four, where he was being held captive by one of the rival factions. Doctor Crusher has repaired the damage to his long term memory. His recovery is proceeding well.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Evidently, you were abducted two days after beaming to the surface.
 RIKER / I remember it now... I was in an alley... they attacked me from behind. I tried to defend myself with the nisroh knife Worf gave me... (beat) I managed to fight off one of them... but I think they injected me with some kind of drug...
 PICARD / We believe they were trying to extract strategic information from your memory using a neuro-somatic technique.
 RIKER / I was in a hospital... then on the Enterprise... and the hospital again... (beat) I kept shifting back and forth... I couldn't tell what was real...
 TROI / Your mind must have created a defense mechanism, a fantasy that helped you resist the neuro-somatic process. Your unconscious fastened onto elements from your real life in an attempt to keep you grounded... to keep you sane.
 RIKER / (onto the idea) The preparation for the mission... the play... they were all recent experiences, fresh in my mind...
 PICARD / Get some rest, Number One. We can talk more in the morning.
 RIKER / Alright... but there's one thing I'd like to do first...
 BEVERLY / Are you sure you want to do this by yourself? The stage crew and I were going to wait until morning...
 RIKER / I'm positive. After what I've experienced... I don't think I could sleep knowing this was still up...
 BEVERLY / (on edge) What?
 BEVERLY / Alright, come in.
 BEVERLY / Guinan... ? What are you doing here?
 BEVERLY / Go to Sickbay. I think Doctor Selar is on duty.
 BEVERLY / Well, you'd better get a new one... because I'm not a doctor on this ship anymore.
 BEVERLY / (rapid) Three days on the shuttle to Starbase twenty-three... then a transport back to Earth... I can hear Admiral Brooks now, telling me how I've disgraced Starfleet Medical... (beat) Then a leisurely day and a half before the formal inquiry begins and my career ends.
 BEVERLY / Your elbow... ?
 BEVERLY / Alright, let me see it...
 BEVERLY / Does that hurt?
 BEVERLY / Tennis elbow, alright. Hold it like this...
 BEVERLY / It's no big thing. Any doctor can have one... all you have to do is disobey orders... violate medical ethics... cause an interstellar incident...
 BEVERLY / (beat) Make a fist.
 BEVERLY / It started when I invited those scientists on board... (beat) No. It started at the Altine Consortium. (beat) Actually, it probably started before that. When I began feeling... comfortable.
 BEVERLY / Too comfortable.
 BEVERLY / (nods) That's why I went to the Altine Conference... to hear the latest bio-physical theories. Maybe find a new area of research. And that's where I met Doctor Reyga... nobody would listen to him -- just because he was a Ferengi. They all but jeered him off the stage...
 BEVERLY / I thought I could be a... facilitator. You see, he had this amazing invention, based on metaphasic field technology. But his methodology was completely unorthodox.
 BEVERLY / I thought... if I could bring scientists from various cultures aboard the Enterprise... sit them down... help them understand the value of his ideas... well, it seemed like the right thing to do.
 BEVERLY / That's it exactly. And believe me, it wasn't easy.
 BEVERLY / I had to persuade Captain Picard... and then I had to round up as many scientists as I could in the field of subspace technology...
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / ... but of all the scientists I invited, only four were interested in hearing about Doctor Reyga's invention.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Kurak was a warp field specialist on the Klingon Homeworld. I don't think Klingons regard scientists very highly... she always seemed a little defensive.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Doctor T'Pan is practically a legend in the field of subspace morphology. She's been the director of the Vulcan Science Academy for fifteen years... (beat) Her husband, Doctor Christopher, came with her... I didn't know much about him... but he was some kind of a subspace theoretician.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Jo'Bril was a Takaran... the first one I'd ever met. I had no idea what to expect from him.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / And then there was Doctor Reyga... the Ferengi scientist.
 BEVERLY / That's why I've asked you all to come here. I think you have the vision to see the potential in Doctor Reyga's metaphasic shield.
 BEVERLY / I think you all realize what this shielding process would mean... the possibilities for exploration and research are endless...
 BEVERLY / (leaping in to diffuse this) Doctor Reyga has offered to demonstrate his invention. He's outfitted one of our shuttles with the metaphasic shield.
 BEVERLY / We'd want to be sure that you're familiar with the shuttle controls... and Doctor Reyga's modifications...
 BEVERLY / Well... (to Reyga) What do you think?
 BEVERLY / Well, then. We'll proceed with the demonstration at fifteen hundred hours. We'll meet on the Bridge.
 BEVERLY / I think that went well, don't you?
 BEVERLY / I didn't do anything...
 BEVERLY / Some of those scientists are still a little doubtful... but after the demonstration I'm sure they'll come around.
 BEVERLY / I'd still expect the scientific community to be more open-minded than they seem to be.
 BEVERLY / You mean jealousy. (shakes her head) I know. I wondered if that might account for Doctor T'Pan's attitude. She's been working on subspace shielding technology for years. And you've beaten her to the punch.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / As far as I was concerned, the hard part was over. I'd stepped out on a limb... and it hadn't broken.
 PICARD, DATA, WORF, Beverly, and the four scientists -- / T'Pan, Christopher, Reyga, and Kurak. They are scattered at the various Aft stations. Beverly is monitoring environmental conditions in the cabin.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Not bad for my first venture into scientific diplomacy.
 DATA / Captain, the shuttle has been launched.
 PICARD / On screen. Open a channel.
 DATA / External temperature is zero-pointnine million Kelvins and rising. Radiation levels are nearing ten thousand rads.
 BEVERLY / That's right. Cabin temperature is twenty-one degrees celcius. Radiation levels are normal.
 DATA / Outside temperature is rising rapidly -- one-point-seven million Kelvins.
 BEVERLY / Cabin temperature is still twenty-one degrees. The shield is holding...
 PICARD / (continuing) Congratulations, Doctor. This is an amazing achievement.
 DATA / Radiation levels outside the shuttle are nearing fourteen thousand rads.
 BEVERLY / (off monitor) But they're normal inside the cabin.
 BEVERLY / Something's wrong.
 RIKER / Mister Data, what's going on?
 DATA / Sensors indicate an increased level of baryon particles in the cabin.
 PICARD / Doctor Jo'Bril, can you hear us? Please respond.
 DATA / Baryon levels are continuing to rise...
 PICARD / Mister Worf, can we beam him out of there?
 WORF / (checks console) The solar radiation is interfering... he must be at least five-hundred thousand kilometers from the star before we can get a Transporter lock.
 PICARD / Doctor Jo'Bril... listen to me. It is imperative that you turn the shuttle... take it out of the corona... (beat) Do you understand what I'm saying?
 PICARD / Pilot the shuttle away from the star...
 BEVERLY / We're losing him...
 DATA / The shuttle is emerging from the corona, sir.
 PICARD / Get a lock on him as soon as you can, Mister Worf.
 BEVERLY / Beam him directly to Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / Twenty cc's inoprovaline...
 BEVERLY / That's not doing it. Cortical stimulators.
 BEVERLY / Again.
 BEVERLY / So that was my first experience as a scientific diplomat. (beat) A complete failure. I don't think I've ever felt so awful.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I don't understand it.
 BEVERLY / I mean... I've lost people before... patients...
 BEVERLY / Yes. But I don't know why.
 BEVERLY / I guess so...
 BEVERLY / I felt... helpless...
 BEVERLY / But Guinan... that wasn't the end. You don't know the half of it.
 PICARD / How's it going?
 BEVERLY / I've never run into a humanoid species like this...
 BEVERLY / His internal physiology is baffling. He doesn't seem to have discrete "organs"... at least not in the traditional sense... practically every system is evenly distributed throughout his body.
 BEVERLY / That kind of physiology should make him incredibly resistant to injury... so whatever killed him had to occur at the cellular level...
 PICARD / Do you have any idea what it was?
 BEVERLY / No. Something caused a massive, system-wide failure... but I don't know what.
 PICARD / Were the solar radiation levels high enough to have killed him?
 BEVERLY / (shakes her head) His exposure to the star's radiation was minimal. It's all very strange...
 BEVERLY / That's odd... his rate of cellular decay is extremely low...
 PICARD / The answers will come, Beverly...
 BEVERLY / (eyes on monitor) Maybe even minimal exposure to radiation altered his physiology at the cellular level...
 PICARD / You've been at this for hours... You might think more clearly if you get a good night's sleep.
 BEVERLY / I couldn't close my eyes. I have to find out what killed him. I owe that to Doctor Reyga.
 PICARD / Are you doing it for Reyga... or yourself?
 BEVERLY / What do you mean?
 PICARD / You're the loneliest person in the world right now... no one can say anything... no one can do anything that will help. You don't think it'll ever go away. (beat) And you're right. It never does. But you can live with it. It doesn't feel that way now, but you can.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / At the time, I was too preoccupied with my problems to understand what he was saying. I wasn't thinking about the rest of my life... I was trying to make sense of what had happened...
 DATA / The flow regulator is functioning properly.
 DATA / (checks system) Yes, Doctor.
 DATA / I am unable to locate any malfunction. All of your systems are operating according to your design specifications.
 BEVERLY / You didn't find anything wrong?
 GEORDI / I found some micro-crystalline damage to the hull which confirms that your shield was breached by a burst of baryonic radiation...
 BEVERLY / Were the levels high enough to damage organic tissue?
 GEORDI / I don't know.
 DATA / (to Reyga) Perhaps there was an unexpected interaction between the solar radiation and your metaphasic shield.
 GEORDI / Then Jo'Bril must've run into something in the corona which you didn't anticipate... and your shield just wasn't able to protect him from it.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Reyga was angry... but I knew it was because he was so disappointed. Everything he'd worked for... hoped for... was slipping away...
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / ... and that made what I had to do next even harder.
 BEVERLY / I'm sure you can all understand that in light of what's happened... it would be inappropriate to continue with the project.
 BEVERLY / Perhaps when Doctor Reyga has perfected his metaphasic technology, we can try again.
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry. But as Chief Medical Officer, I'm responsible for the health and safety of the people aboard. (beat) And I will not authorize any further tests.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / I couldn't help but admire his tenacity. He just wasn't going to accept defeat. And I hoped he would prove himself. (beat) But that was the last time I saw him alive.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / We'd gone to Science Lab Four when the ship's sensors registered a sizeable plasma surge there...
 BEVERLY / A plasma infuser... it's been completely discharged. The blast must have killed him instantly.
 WORF / Perhaps he could not live with the failure of his invention, and took his own life.
 BEVERLY / Or perhaps someone just wants it to look that way. (indicating plasma infuser) Look at this... isn't it odd that he could hold on so tightly to the infuser when it was discharged. The normal reflex would be to drop it.
 WORF / The plasma shock could have affected his nervous system. He may have reacted by gripping tighter.
 BEVERLY / I'll know for certain when I do the autopsy.
 WORF / Is your examination complete, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / For now. You can transfer the body to the Morgue.
 WORF / Very well.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / I remembered his passion... and commitment... and his determination to prove himself. And I was sure that this man had not taken his own life.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, I was with him right before he died. He was not suicidal.
 PICARD / I respect your instincts, of course... but by your own admission, Reyga was not an easy man to understand. Isn't it possible that he was simply masking his feelings?
 BEVERLY / I don't think so. He was disappointed at the failure of his device... and upset by Jo'Bril's death... but there was no sense that he was ready to take his own life.
 PICARD / I'm sure it's difficult for you to accept. You championed him... you believed in his invention...
 BEVERLY / This isn't about my feelings -- I'm saying that Reyga didn't kill himself... and if that's true, someone else did it.
 PICARD / Beverly... I know what you're going through. I know what it's like to feel -- responsible for a tragedy. I know the temptation to look for anything that would remove some of that culpability...
 BEVERLY / (dismissing this) I know I can't expect you to accept what I'm saying without evidence. When I've finished the autopsy, I hope I'll have it.
 PICARD / I'm afraid there won't be an autopsy.
 PICARD / The family has already been contacted... they insist the body must not be touched before they perform the Ferengi death rituals.
 BEVERLY / But... there's a question about the circumstances of his death --
 PICARD / To the family, that is irrelevant.
 BEVERLY / Maybe if I talked to them...
 PICARD / I promise you -- they are adamant. We're scheduled to rendezvous with a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours. They will be picking up Reyga's body then. (beat) I'm sorry. But there will be no autopsy.
 BEVERLY / I can't just let it drop... don't you see -- ? There might have been a murder.
 PICARD / If you can find evidence of that... in some way other than an autopsy... I'll consider it.
 BEVERLY / It's not clear without an autopsy. For all I know, he might have been poisoned... and the plasma infuser put in his hand after he died.
 BEVERLY / I'm not discounting that possibility. The point is, without a complete autopsy, there's no way to know for certain.
 BEVERLY / It has to do with their death rituals. The body can't be violated before it's buried... (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / (beat) And apparently the family is more concerned with ritual than with finding out the truth about his death.
 BEVERLY / (continuing, frustrated) I just can't get the information I need from a tricorder scan...
 BEVERLY / Suspects.
 BEVERLY / If Reyga didn't kill himself... someone else did. So who are the possible suspects?
 BEVERLY / And the only ones I see that fit that category -- are the other scientists.
 BEVERLY / No. But I just can't accept the fact that he took his own life... and I want to explore the possibilities a bit further.
 BEVERLY / That's why I came to you. I wondered if you might have any thoughts along that line...
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure, either. Just... anything you might have heard, or observed... that might provide a clue... (beat) Just as an example... if his technology had been successful, you might have been displaced as the preeminent scientist in subspace technology. That might seem like a motive. Of course, it wasn't successful...
 BEVERLY / (mildly) I'm just trying to uncover the truth. And I'm asking your help to do it. Have you seen or heard anything that might suggest that someone else had a motive?
 BEVERLY / Forgive me... but I get the feeling you're protesting a little too vehemently...
 BEVERLY / Is there something you're not telling me?
 BEVERLY / About what?
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / I knew he might be right about Kurak... Klingons make threats as a matter of course. On the other hand... sometimes they follow through.
 BEVERLY / That looks like one of Doctor Reyga's shield configurations.
 BEVERLY / You seem very interested in technology that failed.
 BEVERLY / Which you're now free to develop...
 BEVERLY / No... but I want to know why you threatened Reyga.
 BEVERLY / What did he accuse you of?
 BEVERLY / Were they lies?
 BEVERLY / Did Reyga make that mistake?
 BEVERLY / You're going to have to throw me a lot harder than that to get it.
 BEVERLY / Now. What did he accuse you of?
 BEVERLY / Sabotage... of the metaphasic shield... was that why it failed?
 BEVERLY / Did you sabotage the project?
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / I was beginning to find out that investigating a murder was a little more perilous than I'd thought. And I really didn't have any more insight than I did before I started.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Which brought me back to Reyga's body... because the more I thought about it...
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / ... the more it seemed that the answers had to be there.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / DNA traces... tissue anomalies... a wealth of forensic clues that could shed some light on this mystery.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / So... I made the decision.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Come.
 PICARD / Beverly. What can I do for you?
 BEVERLY / (reluctantly) Jean-Luc. I'm going to tell you something you need to know. You won't like it. (beat) I just did an autopsy on Doctor Reyga.
 PICARD / And what did you find?
 BEVERLY / Nothing. (beat) I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have done it.
 PICARD / You most certainly should not. I made it clear to you that the family expressly prohibited it. You have not only disobeyed my order, you have interfered in the death rituals of another culture.
 BEVERLY / (miserably) I know.
 PICARD / You've put both of us in a very difficult position. (beat) The family will have to be notified. And I have no doubt that they will react strongly.
 PICARD / If the Ferengi government gets into it... and I'm certain they will... there might be some significant repercussions. (beat) I'm not sure how much I could protect you.
 BEVERLY / You don't have to, Jean-Luc. I knew what I was doing. I'm prepared to accept the consequences.
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / I could tell that he was terribly disappointed in me... and that was almost the hardest part of all...
 BEVERLY / Anyway... the Ferengi lodged a formal complaint with Starfleet Command, and the Captain was ordered to relieve me of duty.
 BEVERLY / So.... that's the story. That's how I managed to end my career.
 BEVERLY / What?
 BEVERLY / Guinan... have you been listening to me?
 BEVERLY / And this is the response I get?
 BEVERLY / Two people have died on this ship... two lives that ended, horribly... and you're worried about your tennis game?
 BEVERLY / Angry? For two hours, I've poured my heart out to you... and all you care about is your elbow. You bet I'm angry!
 BEVERLY / Do... ?
 BEVERLY / I've already tried everything I could think of, and it's only made things worse.
 BEVERLY / No.
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 BEVERLY / I'm in enough trouble already. If I start digging into this again --
 BEVERLY / Data... what are you doing here?
 DATA / I am running additional diagnostics to make certain there was no permanent radiation damage to the shuttlecraft hull.
 BEVERLY / Data, you've studied Doctor Reyga's shield system. Tell me -- do you think it could've been sabotaged?
 DATA / There was no evidence to suggest sabotage.
 BEVERLY / Just consider the possibility...
 DATA / The system interlocks prevent access to the circuitry unless the shield emitter is active. Any attempt to sabotage the device would have to be made while the shield was in operation.
 BEVERLY / The only time the shield was active was during Jo'Bril's test flight.
 DATA / That is correct. It seems unlikely that Jo'Bril would perform sabotage which would result in his own death.
 BEVERLY / I agree. (beat; thinks) Would it be possible to sabotage the shuttle by remote, during the flight?
 DATA / A phased ionic pulse beamed directly into the metaphasic projection matrix would cause a temporary system malfunction.
 BEVERLY / Where on the Enterprise could you generate a phased ionic pulse?
 DATA / Such a pulse could be initiated from the lateral sensor arrays, Science Labs one, four, or sixteen, or any of the bridge science stations.
 BEVERLY / Let's assume for the moment that someone did send out a phased ionic pulse... what would've happened inside the shuttle?
 DATA / A tetryon field would have formed briefly inside the cabin, temporarily disrupting the metaphasic shield.
 BEVERLY / A tetryon field... If Jo'Bril had been exposed to a tetryon field, it might have left residual traces in his tissue...
 BEVERLY / Thanks, Data.
 RIKER / Beverly...
 BEVERLY / Yes?
 RIKER / We've made arrangements for a shuttle to Starbase twenty-three. You can leave at oh-seven-hundred hours tomorrow.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 RIKER / I'm sorry about all this... I'm sure it will all work out fine.
 BEVERLY / Of course.
 RIKER / The inquiry is only a formality... you know the Captain will support you all he can.
 BEVERLY / That will help.
 RIKER / But... if you do anything... foolish... before the inquiry... that wouldn't look so good.
 BEVERLY / I don't know what you're talking about. What you mean...
 RIKER / I think you do. The smartest thing you can do right now is to stay in your quarters and read a good book. Because if you make this situation any worse -- it'll be that much harder on you.
 BEVERLY / Thank you, Commander. Your concern is noted --
 RIKER / Beverly... I'm saying this as a friend.
 BEVERLY / I know, Wil... thank you. (beat) But... as a friend... please try to understand. I can't quit now. And I don't want you to get involved...
 BEVERLY / Computer, access ship's medical logs and download current autopsy files.
 BEVERLY / Ogawa.
 BEVERLY / Don't worry. I know I'm not supposed to be here... I'll go...
 BEVERLY / Alissa...
 BEVERLY / I don't want you to get involved...
 BEVERLY / Yes.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 BEVERLY / First, I want to review Jo'Bril's physiology records... and then I want to take another look at his body. I need to see if there's any evidence of tetryon traces.
 BEVERLY / We'll have to run a tissue scan at the molecular level. Calibrate the scanner to detect tetryon particles.
 BEVERLY / Okay. Activate the scan.
 BEVERLY / (beat; thinks) Let's try it again. Use the enhanced resolution mode to boost the sensitivity.
 BEVERLY / So someone did sabotage the shield...
 BEVERLY / There's one way to be certain...
 TROI / Captain, I'm a little concerned about Beverly. I've tried several times to talk to her, but she keeps avoiding me.
 PICARD / I'm not surprised.
 TROI / (nods) I'm afraid this entire experience has --
 DATA / Captain, there has been an unscheduled launch from Shuttlebay Two.
 RIKER / I have no idea... no one's filed a flight plan...
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / That's the Justman... the shuttle Reyga modified...
 PICARD / Open a hailing frequency.
 PICARD / Beverly... what do you think you're doing?
 BEVERLY / (with determination) Testing a theory, Captain.
 PICARD / A theory?
 BEVERLY / I think Reyga's shield does work.
 PICARD / Return to the ship immediately.
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry.
 PICARD / Mister Worf -- override the shuttle's computer. Return it to the shuttlebay.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WORF / (continuing) Sir, she has isolated her navigational control... it will not be possible to establish remote operation.
 RIKER / Get a tractor beam on her.
 WORF / (checks console) I cannot establish a lock, she is too close to the star... solar interference is too high.
 PICARD / Mister Data, what's her heading?
 DATA / Bearing two-seven-one mark four. She is heading into the sun's corona.
 BEVERLY / (to computer) Computer -- begin monitoring external temperature.
 PICARD / Beverly. What do you hope to accomplish?
 BEVERLY / Doctor Reyga was right about his shield. The only reason it failed was because it was sabotaged... and I'm going to prove it.
 PICARD / You can't be certain of that. You're betting your life on a hypothesis.
 BEVERLY / I'm not wrong.
 DATA / Sir, the shuttle is entering the corona.
 PICARD / Beverly -- what's happening?
 BEVERLY / I'm all right... (to computer) Computer -- shield status?
 BEVERLY / (quietly) Congratulations, Doctor Reyga... you did it.
 BEVERLY / Captain, I want you to post security guards on the three visiting scientists... one of them has to be responsible for sabotaging the first test... I think if we --
 WORF / Sir, we've lost contact.
 BEVERLY / (to com) Enterprise? I've lost you, come in...
 BEVERLY / How... can you be alive... ?
 BEVERLY / (realizing) The slow rate of cellular decay...
 BEVERLY / In the morgue... you were conscious the whole time... you heard everything we said... knew everything we were going to do...
 BEVERLY / What are you doing?
 BEVERLY / For what?
 DATA / (off console) There is no indication of any debris, sir... but the subspace signal indicates a warp engine breach.
 PICARD / (to Data) All right... begin a phase-one search, starting on the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft... (to conn) Ensign, plot a proximity course to --
 WORF / Sir, we are picking up an object emerging from the corona.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Enterprise...
 BEVERLY / ... I'm all right... returning to the ship...
 BEVERLY (V.O.) / Chief Medical Officer's log, Stardate 46831.2. I have been reinstated and will be resuming my duties shortly. In the meantime, I have a personal matter to attend to.
 BEVERLY / Hello, Guinan.
 BEVERLY / Not unless it's yours. (gesturing to package) This is for you.
 BEVERLY / It's a thank you. For giving me a good kick in the butt.
 BEVERLY / I did a little research... this is the latest design... state of the art... and it's specially cushioned to absorb vibration -- so you'll never have to worry about tennis elbow again.
 DATA is in command, with N.D. CREWMEMBERS at all other / positions. RIKER and SEVERAL CREWMEMBERS ENTER from the fore and aft Turbolifts. It's time to change shifts and while Riker moves to Data, the other members of Riker's shift take over their positions from the people on Data's shift. No one moves to relieve the N.D. Ensign standing at Tactical.
 DATA / Good morning, Commander.
 RIKER / Data. Interesting night?
 DATA / I found it extremely interesting. The lateral sensor array performed three separate spectral analyses of the Alwanir Nebula on three distinct frequencies.
 RIKER / Sorry I missed it.
 DATA / (missing the ironic tone) I will have the reports sent to you. (begins making report) We are still on course for the Gariman system, our speed is warp six and our ETA is thirteen hundred hours. Sickbay reported one minor injury in the exobiology department at zero four twenty hours.
 RIKER / Very well.
 RIKER / (to Data) Isn't Worf supposed to relieve Ensign Torigan?
 DATA / Yes, sir. I was not informed of any change in the duty roster.
 RIKER / (concerned) He's never late. (to com) Riker to Lieutenant Worf.
 RIKER / Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf.
 RIKER / Something's wrong. Data, you have the Bridge. (to com) Security, meet me on deck seven, section twenty-five baker.
 RIKER / (to com) Computer, override the security lock on this door. Authorization: Riker alpha six zero.
 WORF'S VOICE / TORVA LUK DO SHELL!
 RIKER / (shocked) Worf? (beat) What the hell are you doing?
 PICARD / He had no explanation at all?
 RIKER / Not a word. He just got dressed and then reported for duty as if nothing had happened. (beat) Captain, this isn't the first... problem I've had with Worf lately.
 PICARD / (surprised) Oh?
 RIKER / Until now, it wasn't anything serious so I didn't bring it to your attention. But, to be blunt, he's been getting... sloppy. His duty reports have been incomplete, he's fallen behind in maintenance checks, he just seems... distracted.
 PICARD / Where's Worf now?
 RIKER / I confined him to quarters.
 PICARD / You have the Bridge, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 WORF / Enter.
 WORF / Captain.
 PICARD / (hard) On your feet, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Sir.
 PICARD / (firm) Mister Worf, your personal affairs are strictly your concern unless they interfere with the operation of this ship. You've crossed that line. Now as your Captain, I want to know exactly what's going on.
 WORF / It is... difficult to explain.
 PICARD / Try.
 WORF / Ever since I returned from the Carraya system I have felt... empty...
 PICARD / Does this have something to do with the Klingons you... rescued from Carraya Four?
 WORF / (nods) They were young... they knew nothing of their heritage. So while I was there, I tried to... teach them... teach them about their people, their culture.
 WORF / I told them our ancient stories... instructed them in our customs... explained our beliefs. And then I told them about Kahless... how he united our people long ago... how he gave us honor and strength... and how he promised to return one day and lead us again. (beat) It took time... but I saw them begin to discover the warriors within themselves... to believe in Kahless and his teachings... and to become truly Klingon. It was ... unlike anything I had experienced before.
 PICARD / Is that what you were doing here? Trying to recapture those feelings?
 WORF / (nods) I was trying to summon a vision of Kahless.
 PICARD / (lightly) You might have tried using the Holodeck instead of setting your quarters on fire.
 WORF / Using the Holodeck would not be appropriate... everything had to be real if Kahless were to appear. (defeated) But all this was for nothing... he did not come to me.
 WORF / I gave Toq and the others a belief in Sto-Vo-Kor: the life which lies beyond this life... where Kahless awaits us. (MORE)
 WORF (Cont'd) / (beat) When I saw the power of their belief... I began to question the strength of my own. And I found it... wanting.
 PICARD / Have you lost your... faith in Sto-Vo-Kor?
 WORF / To lose something, one must first possess it... I am not sure I ever had a true belief.
 WORF / But I should not have allowed it to interfere with my duties. My behavior has been --
 PICARD / Inexcusable. (beat) But understandable. You are the only Klingon in Starfleet... and one of the few raised by human parents. Perhaps the problem is that you have only studied the beliefs of your people... only looked at them from the outside.
 PICARD / It may be that what you seek cannot be found on the Enterprise. You may need to immerse yourself in Klingon beliefs before you can discover whether they hold any truths for you. (beat) Is there anything you could do... any place you could go... to explore your faith more fully?
 WORF / Boreth. The Followers of Kahless wait there for his return. To Klingons, there is no more sacred place.
 PICARD / Boreth is twelve days from here by shuttle. As of this moment, you are on leave.
 WORF / Thank you, Captain.
 PICARD / I hope you find what you're looking for, Mister Worf. (beat) Because the next time you set foot on this ship I expect you to carry out your duties like a Starfleet officer.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WORF / (low, intense) Torva... Luk...
 WORF / (without turning around) It has been ten days, Koroth. But I have had no visions... I have received no insight. (beat) There is nothing for me here.
 WORF / When Kahless united the people and gave them the laws of honor, he saw that his work was done. So one night he gathered his belongings and went to the edge of the city to say good-bye.
 WORF / And Kahless said, "You are Klingons. You need no one but yourselves. I will go now... to Sto-Vo-Kor. But I promise one day I will return." Then Kahless pointed to a star in the sky and said, "Look for me there... on that point of light."
 WORF / (softly) I will open my heart, Kahless. (beat) I will...
 WORF / Torva... Luk... Do... Shell...
 WORF / I see Kahless.
 WORF / You are... real?
 WORF / I was getting my tricorder.
 WORF / No. It is a tool. I was going to use it to see if you were...
 WORF / You are... Klingon.
 WORF / There are many possibilities... a shape shifter, a holographic projection...
 WORF / How do you know my name?
 WORF / (stunned) Yes...
 WORF / (nods) I... am the first Klingon to serve in Starfleet.
 WORF / Why did you appear when I was in the cave? Why not appear to Koroth, or Torin?
 WORF / I... want to believe.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 46852.2. Our mission to Endora Seven has been cancelled on orders from Starfleet Command. The Enterprise is to proceed directly to the planet Boreth, to take aboard a very unusual guest.
 RIKER / Kahless? Hasn't he been dead for over a thousand years?
 DATA / One thousand five hundred and forty-seven years to be exact.
 TROI / Do the Klingons actually believe that this is the real Kahless?
 PICARD / It would seem that at least Gowron believes it. He personally contacted the Federation Council and asked that a starship be sent to bring Kahless back to the Home World.
 RIKER / Why wouldn't he send a Klingon ship?
 PICARD / Gowron would only say that there were certain... security concerns which prompted him to make this request. As the nearest starship to Boreth, the task is ours.
 TROI / Have we heard from Worf?
 PICARD / No. All communication with Boreth has been cut-off since yesterday.
 PICARD / Set course for Boreth, Number One. Warp six.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 WORF / Questions are the beginning of wisdom... it is the mark of a true warrior.
 WORF / Yes. If the... commander is worthy of their trust.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
 WORF / Yes.
 PICARD / (recovering quickly) Thank you.
 WORF / They have... different ways.
 WORF / No.
 PICARD / I would be happy to arrange a tour of the entire ship for you, once you've settled in. Perhaps Commander Riker could begin by showing you your quarters.
 RIKER / Then, if you'll follow me...
 BEVERLY / (to Worf) Did you take any other tricorder readings... a neuro-physiology scan or an anatomical profile?
 WORF / No.
 BEVERLY / (to others) Then it's going to be hard to eliminate any possibility at this point. He could be a coalescent being taking Klingon form... a bioreplicant... or even a Klingon surgically altered to resemble Kahless...
 TROI / I felt no deception or malice from him... just an over-whelming sense of confidence... almost arrogance.
 PICARD / Worf, what are his plans when he returns to the Home World?
 WORF / He wants to restore the glory of the Empire by purging it of dishonor and corruption.
 RIKER / I don't think Gowron's going to like the sound of that.
 GEORDI / That might have something to do with why he wanted a Federation ship to bring Kahless. Gowron may not want to be seen embracing this... Messiah before he knows what Kahless wants.
 PICARD / Perhaps this Kahless is a... stalking horse for someone else... someone who intends to seize control from Gowron.
 WORF / It is not an... empirical matter. It is a matter of... faith.
 DATA / Faith. Then you do believe Kahless may have... supernatural attributes?
 DATA / As an android, I am unable to accept something which cannot be proven through rational means. I would appreciate hearing your insight on this matter.
 WORF / Perhaps some other time, Commander. I do not believe I could provide much... insight at the moment.
 RIKER / Like the Duras sisters...
 DATA / Or the B'nok faction.
 WORF / There is another possibility. (beat) It could be the real Kahless. He may have actually returned... as he promised.
 DATA / The appearance of Kahless in the lava cave is consistent with the stories found in the Klingon sacred texts.
 RIKER / No offense, Worf... but I have trouble believing that the man I just escorted to deck eight is... supernatural.
 WORF / I am not saying that he is... I merely think we should not completely reject the possibility.
 PICARD / We have no reason to rule out anything. We haven't been ordered to discover the origins of our guest, or tell anyone what they should believe... we are simply to transport Kahless to the Home World... and while he's with us, he will be treated as an honored guest.
 DATA / Lieutenant. May I ask you a personal question? (off his nod) In the absence of empirical data, how will you determine whether or not this is the real Kahless?
 WORF / It was given to me during my Rite of Ascension by a man who had known my father.
 WORF / No... I returned to the Home World for the ceremony. But these... aliens have allowed me to conduct other Klingon rituals on the Enterprise. They understand that it is part of me.
 WORF / He is visiting my adoptive parents on Earth.
 WORF / I have instructed him in our traditions... but Alexander will have to find his own path... as I did.
 DATA / (off console) Commander, there is an incoming message. Text only.
 DATA / It is from Gowron. He is aboard the Klingon ship Bortas and is requesting that we alter course to rendezvous with him.
 RIKER / (reading console) The rendezvous coordinates are twenty-three light years outside the Klingon Border. What's he up to? (beat, then to Con Officer) Prepare to alter course. (to com) Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.
 PICARD / Welcome aboard, Gowron.
 PICARD / I assume you're referring to Kahless.
 PICARD / Well, the... person in question is in his quarters at the moment.
 PICARD / We haven't done any analyses.
 PICARD / If you wanted to run tests on Kahless, you should've sent a Klingon vessel for him.
 PICARD / If he's really an imposter you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
 PICARD / ... so Gowron has come aboard in order to test your claim.
 PICARD / He has brought a knife with him... a knife that was supposed to be stained with the blood of Kahless.
 PICARD / (to Kahless) Gowron wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood and on you. It should tell us if there is a... biological match. (beat) If you agree to the test... I will make the Enterprise facilities available to... ensure that it is conducted impartially.
 BEVERLY / All right... that should do it.
 BEVERLY / Computer, run a genetic comparison on this blood sample and the tissue belonging to Kahless.
 WORF / It is true... Kahless has returned.
 WORF / Koroth, Torin. (looks around) I had hoped to speak with Kahless...
 WORF / I am sorry our replicators do not do justice to Klingon Warnog...
 WORF / Kahless, may I ask you about... death... and Sto-Vo-Kor? Tell me what awaits us beyond this life.
 WORF / (surprised) Me?
 WORF / ... it will be glorious.
 WORF / He is Kahless. Your own test proved it.
 WORF / It is not Koroth, it is --
 WORF / It does not have to be that way... we could all join together and welcome Kahless as a united people.
 WORF / You do not understand. Kahless is our future... only with his help can we revive the pure warriors within ourselves. (beat) Listen to him, Gowron... open your heart and hear his words as I have. He will restore your faith... as he has restored mine. Give him a chance to lift your spirit and cleanse your heart before you take up arms.
 WORF / I did. Kahless approved.
 DATA / Lieutenant, would my presence here be inappropriate? I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to study Klingon beliefs in this forum, but I do not wish to give offense.
 WORF / Kahless welcomes all who come to hear his words. Your presence will not give offense.
 DATA / Thank you.
 WORF / (to Koroth) No. I do not believe Kahless will kill him.
 WORF / (hard) There is no future here... no glorious new era for our people. (moves to Kahless) Gowron was right, you don't know the name of the man who faced the storm... you don't even know what real Warnog tastes like... and you certainly are not the greatest warrior of all. (beat) Whoever you are... you're not Kahless.
 WORF / (deadly) You are using the name of Kahless in some twisted game... for that alone you should die... and if you do not tell me what you have done, I will kill you right here.
 WORF / (shocked) A clone. He is a clone.
 WORF / (disgusted) A being created in a laboratory... from genetic material taken from another being. You are a copy... a fraud.
 WORF / They grew you in a test tube... like some kind of fungus... then programmed you like a machine.
 WORF / You talk to me about the truth? You, who have brought this... lie to life and then called it Kahless?
 WORF / They do not need a false god.
 WORF / I am. And I will not let this... fraud continue.
 WORF / (low, deadly) Do not give me orders, Koroth.
 DATA'S VOICE / (o.c.) They have been here for three hours seventeen minutes.
 DATA / They refused to transport back to the ship with the rest of Gowron's men. They insisted on waiting here until they see Kahless again. Their faith appears to be unaffected by his inability to defeat Gowron. They still believe.
 WORF / Then they are fools.
 DATA / Does that mean you no longer believe this is the real Kahless?
 WORF / (difficult) Yes.
 DATA / I am curious. Do you still believe that the real Kahless will return someday? Or has this experience only deepened the spiritual crisis which originally sent you to Boreth?
 WORF / I... do not know.
 DATA / I understand your dilemma. I once had what could be considered a crisis of the spirit.
 WORF / (shocked) You?
 DATA / Yes. The Starfleet officers who first activated me on Omicron Theta told me that I was an android -- nothing more than a very sophisticated machine in human form. (beat) However I realized that if I were simply a machine, then I could never be anything else -- I could not grow beyond my programming. I found that difficult to accept. (beat) I chose to believe that I was a person, that I had the potential to become more than a collection of circuits and subprocessors. (beat) It is a belief that I still hold.
 WORF / How did you come to your decision?
 DATA / I believe I made a... "leap of faith."
 PICARD / Gentlemen, please. Let us stick to the issue at--
 PICARD / Mister Worf?
 WORF / Captain, will you excuse us for a moment?
 PICARD / Of course.
 WORF / The man that appeared to me on Boreth is not the real Kahless. He is a clone.
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / (hard) It does not matter, Gowron. You will still not be able to stand against him.
 WORF / I said he was not the real Kahless... but in the minds of our people he can be just as powerful as Kahless. (beat) Even now, two members of your own crew are sitting on our Holodeck... waiting for him to return.
 WORF / They are not alone... like many of our people, they need something to believe in... just as I did... something larger than themselves... something that will give their lives meaning. They need Kahless.
 WORF / It will not matter. Despite the facts, they will still believe... They will... make a leap of faith... and there will be others just like them... not everyone... but enough to plunge the Empire into civil war if you oppose them.
 WORF / No... that would be unwise as well.
 WORF / You were right about one thing, Koroth... our people are becoming corrupt and decadent... they need moral leadership. Kahless can be that leader... as Emperor.
 WORF / The political power would remain with the High Council. Kahless would be... a figurehead. But he would have the ability to rally the people... to lead by example... and guide them in spiritual matters.
 WORF / Real power is in the heart. You would have the power to mold the Klingon heart... you could return them to honorable ways... according to the original teachings of Kahless, which are within you... it would be a great challenge, if you have the courage to accept it.
 WORF / We will tell them the truth... all of the truth. But we will also tell them that even if he is not the real Kahless... he is the rightful heir to Kahless.
 WORF / Then my brother and all who support him on the Council will fight you... and I will fight you... and the Empire will fall back into civil war.
 WORF / Good-bye.
 WORF / I went to Boreth to find my faith... and for a time I thought I did... but now, my heart is empty again. I do not know what to believe...
 WORF / Q'apla... Kahless.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46915.2. The Enterprise is orbiting Nervala Four, waiting for an opportunity to retrieve scientific data left there by Starfleet researchers when they were forced to evacuate eight years ago.
 TROI and BEVERLY are sitting together, enjoying the / music. Riker's quartet finishes a number and they join in the applause. Riker bows, gestures to include his fellow Band Members.
 RIKER / Thank you... thank you very much.
 RIKER / Any requests tonight?
 TROI / Night Bird.
 RIKER / Anyone?
 TROI / (louder) Night Bird!
 RIKER / Ladies and Gentlemen... Night Bird.
 BEVERLY / What was that all about?
 TROI / (mischievous smile) Wil's been trying to get this piece right for ten years now. He's never made it through the solo.
 BEVERLY / Remember that dance recital I told you I was doing?
 TROI / (nods) Next week.
 BEVERLY / You're dis-invited.
 TROI / Here it comes.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to Commander Riker.
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Riker, here.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Commander, you are needed on the Bridge.
 RIKER / On my way.
 RIKER / Saved by the bell...
 RIKER / You wanted to see me, Data?
 DATA / Yes, sir. It appears that we will be able to transport to the surface sooner than we anticipated.
 RIKER / Is the planet's distortion field de-phasing sooner than you predicted?
 DATA / No, sir. But using the Potemkin's transport logs from the original evacuation, Commander La Forge and I were able to modify the Transporters.
 RIKER / (catching on) So we can beam through higher distortion levels.
 DATA / (nods) The Transporters are now considerably more efficient than those used on the Potemkin eight years ago.
 RIKER / Glad to hear it. I almost didn't make it off the surface that day. (beat) When can we get started?
 DATA / Ninety-seven minutes.
 RIKER / How long will the transport window last?
 DATA / Twenty-six minutes. After that, the distortion field will re-phase.
 RIKER / That doesn't give us much time to retrieve the database.
 DATA / The planet's proximity to its sun will create two additional transport windows in the next three days.
 RIKER / Let's hope that's enough.
 DATA / It will have to be. The next transport window will not occur for another eight years, when the planet's orbit brings it close enough to the sun to de-phase the distortion field.
 RIKER / Notify the Away Team we're going in ahead of schedule; I'll tell the Captain.
 GEORDI is doing a last minute check on the Transporter / system. A transport technician, ENSIGN PALMER is at one of the side panels adjacent to the Transporter chamber, assisting him. Riker, Data, and WORF ENTER with an N.D. technician.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) How long until the transport window opens?
 GEORDI / Fourteen seconds.
 RIKER / (to others) Let's get in position.
 GEORDI / Whenever you're ready, Commander.
 RIKER / Energize.
 RIKER / This isn't how I remember it; the place was a mess when we left.
 DATA / Commander...
 RIKER / Someone's been here...
 WORF / A vessel could have gotten caught in the distortion field and crashed. The survivors may have taken shelter here.
 DATA / Commander, someone is approaching... a humanoid. Forty meters due east and closing.
 RIKER / Who are you?
 RIKER / Commander William Riker of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 DATA / May I ask how you got here?
 RIKER / What ship were you on?
 DATA / Why did you not return to the Potemkin with the others?
 RIKER / That's not what happened. I was the last one out... but I made it back to the Potemkin.
 RIKER / It's not that we don't believe you; it's just hard to see how both our stories could be true. (beat) Would you be willing to let our Doctor check you out?
 RIKER / Lieutenant Worf, take him to Sickbay. Notify the Captain as soon as you're aboard.
 WORF / (activates combadge) Worf to Enterprise. Two to beam up.
 RIKER / Let's get to work.
 BEVERLY / Looks like you fractured your arm a few years ago.
 PICARD / Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / If you are Wil Riker, if there are two of you... then something extraordinary has occurred. I hope you understand our need to verify your claim.
 BEVERLY / Genetically, he's indistinguishable from Commander Riker.
 PICARD / Could some sort of cloning be involved?
 BEVERLY / I don't think so, there's no genetic drift.
 PICARD / But that isn't conclusive.
 BEVERLY / That's why I compared their brain scans. Brain organization patterns are as unique as... fingerprints. Except for some minor differences, theirs are identical.
 PICARD / Can't brain patterns be cloned?
 BEVERLY / No. They're determined by experience, mostly in early childhood.
 PICARD / How could two men have shared the same childhood experiences? It doesn't make any sense.
 PICARD / (stopping him) Lieutenant -- my Chief Engineer is checking over the transport logs from the Potemkin. They may shed some light on what happened.
 PICARD / Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this.
 PICARD / In the meantime you'll be taken to quarters. Make yourself comfortable.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) ... apparently there was a massive energy surge in the distortion field around the planet just at the moment you tried to beam out. The Transporter Chief tried to compensate by initiating a second containment beam.
 DATA / An interesting approach. He must have been planning to reintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer.
 GEORDI / Turns out he didn't have to. Commander Riker's pattern maintained its integrity with just the one containment beam -- he made it back to the ship just fine.
 BEVERLY / What happened to the second beam?
 GEORDI / The Transporter Chief shut it down, but somehow... it was reflected back to the surface.
 PICARD / And another Wil Riker materialized there.
 RIKER / How could the second pattern have maintained its integrity?
 GEORDI / The containment beam must have had the exact same phase differential as the distortion field.
 RIKER / Which one of us is... real?
 GEORDI / Both. You were both re-materialized from a complete pattern.
 BEVERLY / (to Riker) Up to that moment, you were the same person.
 PICARD / But over the last eight years, you and...
 PICARD / (continuing) -- Lieutenant Riker have lived very different lives. You're different people now.
 PICARD / For us, it's a little like meeting a close friend's twin. You can't help feeling that you know them... but of course you don't.
 PICARD / No matter how strange it may seem to us... there are now two Wil Rikers aboard this vessel. Getting used to the idea may take a while... especially for you, Wil.
 RIKER / I'll be all right, sir.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Riker will be here for a few days at least. We should do everything we can to make him feel comfortable and welcome.
 RIKER / That still leaves us with the problem of how to retrieve the database. The station's computer is only partially operational.
 DATA / Many of its components have been removed. Apparently Lieutenant Riker used them to keep the station's radiation shield operational.
 PICARD / Can we repair it, at least enough to access the database?
 RIKER / Without knowing what he did, it'll be tough.
 BEVERLY / Maybe he could help?
 PICARD / He was alone down there a long time. I'm hesitant to send him back until he's been evaluated.
 TROI / I'll talk to him.
 PICARD / Thank you, Counselor.
 TROI / Hello, Wil.
 TROI / Wil...
 TROI / We need to talk.
 TROI / No.
 TROI / Commander Riker and I are friends, close friends; nothing more.
 TROI / Wil -- why don't we sit down?
 TROI / Do you remember the last time we saw each other?
 TROI / It was the day before you started your tour on the Potemkin.
 TROI / We never did.
 TROI / What I mean is... Commander Riker and I never did.
 TROI / You see... he earned a promotion very quickly.
 TROI / He chose to make his career a priority. There wasn't time for much of anything else.
 TROI / We kept in touch... but we didn't see each other again until we were both posted to the Enterprise two years later.
 TROI / By then, our feelings for each other had changed. We've served together for six years now... things never went back to the way they used to be.
 TROI / I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but that doesn't mean you can't make a future for yourself.
 TROI / Captain Picard wanted me to find out if you'd be willing to help us retrieve the station's database.
 TROI / Do you feel up to it?
 TROI / I'll tell the Captain.
 TROI / Well... I have to go.
 TROI / (gently) Good night, Wil...
 RIKER / How long will we have?
 WORF / We are losing time. Lieutenant Riker should be here.
 RIKER / Computer, where is Lieutenant --
 RIKER / Cancel inquiry.
 WORF / You were supposed to report here at eight hundred hours.
 RIKER / (lightly) I guess it's been a while since you had to punch a clock.
 RIKER / (to others) Let's go.
 RIKER / Energize.
 RIKER / Check out the primary EPS coupling, see if you can get some power to the rest of these consoles.
 RIKER / Can we access it from here?
 RIKER / I was thinking... we should probably let Dad know what's happened.
 RIKER / I don't know. He and I patched up a few things.
 RIKER / I didn't. He came to the Enterprise to brief me when I was offered the Aries.
 RIKER / He couldn't understand why I did it.
 WORF / The primary EPS coupling is fused. It will have to be replaced.
 RIKER / Let's see if that does the trick.
 DATA / We have less than three minutes left.
 RIKER / It's too dangerous. Our scans show the caverns are unstable.
 RIKER / We'll come back during the third window with a new EPS coupling and try to access the core from another console up here.
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Riker to Enterprise.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Enterprise, here.
 RIKER / We're ready to beam up.
 RIKER / Hold it --
 RIKER / (firm) I gave you an order, Lieutenant.
 TROI / (to replicator) Computer -- valerian root tea, hot.
 TROI / Meet me in Transporter Room Three at nineteen hundred hours. It's important.
 TROI / (reads) It pulses unendingly All through the night; Seek out the crystal That powers our flight.
 GEORDI / Can I help you with something, Counselor?
 TROI / No -- thanks, anyway.
 TROI / (reads) What the future holds No one can know But forward we look And Forward you go...
 TROI / (smiles) I remember. Where did you get this?
 TROI / (surprised) You made this?
 TROI / It's lovely. Thank you.
 TROI / How does it feel being with people again?
 TROI / I can imagine.
 TROI / Is that what you've decided to do?
 TROI / It's good that you don't feel... set back.
 TROI / I can understand that.
 TROI / (smiles) I'm sure I looked terrible -- my eyes all red and swollen from crying.
 TROI / The other day, when I told you how Commander Riker and I didn't meet on Risa... what I didn't say was how disappointed I was.
 TROI / I started hearing from him less and less... I knew his career was taking him away from me, but I didn't want to believe it was over. I spent a lot of time thinking about him, wondering where he was, what he was doing.
 TROI / Sometimes I'd look up into the sky... and imagine that he knew, that he could sense me thinking about him.
 TROI / Who knows? Maybe one night... you and I were both looking up at the same star. You were thinking about me... and in a way, I was thinking about you.
 RIKER / You wanted to see me, Sir?
 PICARD / Yes, Number One. Come in.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Riker came to see me about the away mission.
 PICARD / He believes the only way to retrieve the database is by directly accessing the main core underneath the station.
 RIKER / Seismic activity has made the caverns very unstable. In my opinion, it's too risky.
 PICARD / He said he'd been down there quite recently; he seems confident it can be done safely.
 RIKER / There's a good chance we can retrieve the database from one of the consoles inside the station.
 PICARD / But if that doesn't work, it'll be eight years before we get another chance.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Riker's plan is more dangerous, but I'll admit, it has a better chance of succeeding.
 PICARD / Given the importance of this data, I think it's worth the risk.
 RIKER / I'll look over the schematics and draw up a mission plan.
 PICARD / I'm sure Lieutenant Riker would be happy to help you with that.
 RIKER / (even) I'll talk to him.
 RIKER / Lieutenant.
 RIKER / I just spoke with the Captain about your mission recommendation. I'd appreciate it if next time you came to me first.
 RIKER / I heard you, Lieutenant. And I rejected your plan.
 RIKER / He's going with your recommendation, but that's not the point.
 RIKER / If you think I'm coming down on you because the Captain overruled me, think again. I happen to disagree with his decision, but he's my commanding officer and I follow his orders. Just so there's no confusion, I'm your commanding officer and I expect you to do the same. If you can't, then you don't have a place on my Away Team.
 RIKER / We're meeting in the Observation lounge at fourteen hundred hours to draw up a mission plan.
 TROI / ... we stayed in Ten Forward talking for hours.
 BEVERLY / What happened then?
 TROI / (simply) He walked me to my quarters.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) What happened then?
 TROI / (dismissing this) Beverly --
 BEVERLY / I'm just asking.
 TROI / It's been over between Wil and me for a long time.
 BEVERLY / He's not Wil. He is, but -- you know what I mean.
 TROI / I do. But... it's hard for me to separate my feelings for them.
 BEVERLY / Deanna... just because things turned out the way they did between you and Commander Riker... that doesn't mean you shouldn't let things with Lieutenant Riker take their own course.
 TROI / (smiles) I should have known you'd encourage me.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) Isn't that why you brought it up?
 BEVERLY / (to Troi) Well... I think I'll call it a day.
 TROI / (don't) Beverly.
 BEVERLY / Bye.
 TROI / They're Klingon exercises, actually. Lieutenant Worf has been teaching a class.
 TROI / You just did the KoH-man-ara.
 TROI / I had no idea they were so similar.
 TROI / Hello, Wil.
 RIKER / Deanna...
 TROI / I wanted to talk to you about something.
 RIKER / (gently) If you want to be with him... you don't have to ask my permission.
 RIKER / (smiles) There's a certain look in your eyes. I know... you used to have it for me.
 TROI / We've both had relationships with other people before; but this is different.
 TROI / I didn't know how you would feel about it.
 RIKER / Flattered. (smiles) Sort of.
 TROI / It must be very strange for you. I know it is for me.
 RIKER / Ever since he came aboard... I keep finding myself thinking about... the choices you and I made.
 TROI / Me too.
 RIKER / Just do one thing for me... be careful.
 TROI / Wil... I know you and he have had some problems --
 RIKER / We have. But that's not what I'm talking about. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (beat) If he'd made it off that planet instead of me... don't you think he would have made the same choices I did?
 RIKER / I just don't want you to get hurt... again.
 WORF / Two pair.
 RIKER / Three of a kind.
 RIKER / I'd like to thank you both for your very generous contributions.
 RIKER / Come in.
 RIKER / Why don't you join us?
 DATA / The game is five card draw, no limit.
 DATA / Lieutenant?
 DATA / Mister Worf?
 WORF / Four.
 RIKER / None for me.
 DATA / The dealer will take two.
 DATA / You control the bet.
 WORF / Fold.
 RIKER / (tossing in his chips) I'm in.
 RIKER / No thanks.
 RIKER / You in?
 DATA / I will see your fifty and call.
 DATA / The dealer folds.
 RIKER / I spent too much time practicing in the mirror to be fooled by that face. You're bluffing.
 RIKER / We'll see who comes out on top.
 RIKER / I've never settled for anything in my life. I've made choices that some people may not understand, but I know what I want -- and I know what I've got. You'd be lucky to do as well. (beat) Lieutenant.
 RIKER / (bets) I'll see your hundred and call.
 RIKER / Now I know you're bluffing.
 RIKER / Why don't we just get this over with? I'll match your three, and raise you whatever you have left.
 RIKER / Well?
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / When would you leave?
 TROI / I see.
 TROI / You said those exact words to me once before... when you first went to serve on the Potemkin.
 TROI / But if you hadn't... what would have happened between us?
 TROI / I don't know if I can believe that.
 TROI / It took me a long time to get over what happened between Commander Riker and me. I don't know if I want to put myself in that position again.
 TROI / It's not just that... I've worked hard to make a life for myself on the Enterprise. I'm happy here.
 TROI / I know.
 TROI / No.
 TROI / I just don't know if I'm ready to give up my life here.
 TROI / Maybe we both need time to think.
 PICARD / Captain's Log, supplemental. The third transport window has opened and the Away Team is making their final attempt at retrieving the database.
 RIKER / (to Lieutenant Riker) You're with me, Lieutenant.
 RIKER / It doesn't take that much expertise to repair a servo-link. You and I can handle it.
 DATA / I am curious about something, Lieutenant. If you met a double of yourself, would you find it difficult to interact with him?
 WORF / I think so.
 DATA / Why?
 WORF / I am not... easy to get along with.
 DATA / But Commander Riker and Lieutenant Riker are. Yet they seem to have trouble getting along with each another.
 DATA / I have found that humans value their uniqueness, their sense that they are different from every one else. The existence of a double would preclude that feeling. Could that be the source of friction?
 WORF / Perhaps it is more a matter of seeing something in your double... something you don't like about yourself.
 RIKER / Are you waiting for something?
 RIKER / You've been down here "dozens" of times -- I'm sure you know the best way.
 RIKER / Why didn't you report this?
 RIKER / Scan it now.
 RIKER / Next time don't give up so easily.
 RIKER / I'm being pulled in --
 RIKER / Take my hand --
 RIKER / Take it!
 RIKER / Climb --
 DATA / They have restored the servo-link to the core. We can begin downloading the database.
 WORF / Initiating data transfer.
 PICARD / Captain's Log, Stardate 46920.1. We have retrieved the database from Nervala station and are headed for our rendezvous with the Gandhi.
 TROI / I understand the Gandhi is going on a terraforming mission to the Lagana Sector.
 TROI / I won't be going with you.
 TROI / I'm not ready to give up my life here.
 TROI / Not yet.
 RIKER / I'm sorry --
 RIKER / I wanted to give you something...
 RIKER / My quarters are full of things that used to be yours. I figured you should at least have this.
 RIKER / Good luck, Wil.
 TROI / Your middle name.
 RIKER / (with a grin) I guess we are different. I never really cared for it.
 RIKER is sitting on a bed, a nasty-looking SCRATCH on / the side of his face. BEVERLY is scanning his face with a medical tricorder.
 BEVERLY / You really did it this time, Wil. It's not just a scrape... it's a deep cut.
 BEVERLY / I can heal it... but it would serve you right if I didn't.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) You can't keep playing Parises Squares like you're twenty-one years old. One of these days you're going to fall and break your neck... and I won't be able to heal that so easily.
 RIKER / Actually... I wasn't playing Parises Squares...
 BEVERLY / Mmm... Worf's calisthenic program again...
 RIKER / No...
 BEVERLY / Oh? What were you doing?
 RIKER / I was trying to feed Spot.
 BEVERLY / Data's cat?
 RIKER / (nods) I told Data I'd feed it while he was away...
 RIKER / All I remember is setting down the food... and then a hissing ball of fur came out of nowhere. (beat) I hate cats.
 BEVERLY / You've just got to know how to handle them.
 RIKER / Maybe you'd like to feed Spot.
 BEVERLY / I'd be happy to...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Commander Riker to the Bridge.
 RIKER / (taps combadge) On my way.
 RIKER / Oh, and Doctor...
 RIKER / You're going to need this.
 WORF at tactical; N.D.S. at various positions. Riker / ENTERS and moves to Command.
 RIKER / Report.
 WORF / We are picking up a distress call on the long range sensors. (beat) It is Romulan, sir.
 RIKER / Romulan?
 WORF / (off console) They claim they have suffered a complete engine failure. Their power levels are dropping... and their life support is failing. (dubious) It could be a trick.
 RIKER / How long until our rendezvous with Captain Picard?
 WORF / Approximately thirteen hours.
 RIKER / Set course for the Romulan ship, Mister Worf. (beat) Raise our shields, and go to Red Alert. I want to be ready for anything.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46944.2. Commander Data, Mister La Forge, Counselor Troi and I are en route to the Enterprise, after attending a three day conference on the psychological effects of long-term deep space assignments.
 DATA is at the controls. He hits a few controls. / 
 DATA / (to computer) Computer -- activate automatic helm control.
 This is a NEW SET: A large room with a table, chairs, a couple of beds and a console. PICARD, GEORDI and TROI are seated around the table, finishing the / remnants of a sparse lunch: a BOWL OF FRUIT, sandwiches, drinks, etc. The mood is fun, light. Data ENTERS and joins the conversation.
 TROI / So just as I'm leaving the reception, a Ktarian walks up to me and says...
 TROI / (continuing) "So Diane... I understand you're an empath. I'm a very... sensitive man myself. I'm doing a thesis on interspecies mating rituals. Would you care to join me in some empirical research?"
 GEORDI / Don't tell me -- Doctor Mizan.
 TROI / (surprised) That's right.
 GEORDI / He's notorious. But he really is an expert on interspecies mating practices.
 DATA / (to Troi) Did you help him with his research, Counselor?
 TROI / Absolutely not.
 DATA / But I thought that topic interested you.
 TROI / (awkward) Yes... but...
 PICARD / I'll explain it to you later, Data.
 GEORDI / (to Troi) What did you think of the rest of the conference?
 TROI / To be honest... I was bored. I spent most of my time in Doctor Wagner's phylobiology seminar. (beat) I thought the idea of a seminar was that we would all participate... bring different points of views to the discussion...
 TROI (Cont'd) / (beat) He gathered two hundred scientists from all over the Federation... and all he did was put us to sleep.
 DATA / (to Troi) I have a memory record of the entire lecture, Counselor. I can repeat the portions you missed, if you --
 TROI / (quickly) No thank you, Data.
 PICARD / It wasn't any better at the physiognomy workshop. Doctor Vassbinder gave an hour long dissertation on the ionization effect of warp nacelles -- before he realized the topic was supposed to be psychology.
 GEORDI / Why didn't somebody tell him?
 PICARD / There was never an opportunity -- never a pause. He just kept talking... like he was speaking in one incredibly long, run-on sentence. (beat) It was almost... hypnotic.
 GEORDI / Well, I had a good time. The warp energy symposium was fascinating. (beat) I actually got the chance to touch a plasma field.
 TROI / Really. What was it like?
 GEORDI / Incredible. I could feel the plasma crawling up my arm. It was warm... and it gave off a tingling sensation that --
 TROI / Captain? (beat) Data... ?
 GEORDI / (continuing dialogue) -- went all the way down my chest. It was kind of like taking a bath in pure energy.
 DATA / It was not painful?
 GEORDI / Not at all. In fact...
 GEORDI / Is there something wrong, Counselor?
 TROI / I'm... not sure...
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) Our bio-scans check out. There are no physiological anomalies. (beat) If something did happen, it didn't leave any biological traces.
 PICARD / (to Troi) How long did it appear to you that we were... frozen?
 TROI / I don't know... four, maybe five seconds. You just... stopped... and then started again... (beat) I can't explain it...
 DATA / (continuing) My memory record does not indicate a pause or disruption during that period of time.
 DATA / My internal chronometer and the ship's computer are perfectly synchronized. There does not appear to be a temporal discrepancy.
 GEORDI / Data -- let's run a ship-wide diagnostic. Maybe there's something we missed...
 PICARD / Let's go through it again. You were sitting there... and we were sitting here... (beat) Describe the exact moment when things appeared to freeze.
 TROI / Geordi was talking about what it felt like to touch the plasma field... You were lifting the cup, about to take a drink...
 PICARD / Did you sense anything from us during that time? Any unusual emotions?
 TROI / No... not a thing. I was empathically aware of you, right up to the moment you froze, but then it all stopped...
 TROI / The past few days have been exhausting. Maybe it was my imagination... (lightly) There were moments in that lecture hall when I thought time was standing still, too...
 PICARD / There is another possibility, Counselor. Perhaps this was nothing more than a simple --
 PICARD / Are you alright?
 TROI / What happened?
 DATA / You have been motionless for three minutes, eleven seconds.
 TROI / Motionless... ?
 PICARD / It appears to be the same effect you described to us. (beat) Can you remember anything?
 TROI / No... one second I was sitting here talking with you... the next, you were all standing around me.
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) Wait a second... this is weird...
 TROI / What is it?
 GEORDI / I had the tricorder run a comparison between the bio-scan I took of you earlier... and the one I took just now... (beat) In the time between the two scans, you should have aged twenty-three minutes. But according to your cellular decay levels... you've only aged twenty minutes.
 PICARD / (reacts) What could account for the discrepancy?
 GEORDI / I don't know, sir. It's as if for three minutes, time stopped for Counselor Troi.
 PICARD / Mister Data -- contact the Enterprise. Tell Commander Riker to get to the rendezvous point as soon as possible. Have him begin scanning the region for temporal anomalies.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / I'll take a look at the sensor logs... see if I can find anything.
 DATA (O.S.) / Captain.
 DATA / The Enterprise is not responding to our hails.
 PICARD / Are we within sensor range yet?
 DATA / No sir.
 PICARD / Increase speed to the rendezvous coordinates.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 DATA / (off console) We have an engine failure warning in the --
 PICARD / Report!
 GEORDI / The starboard nacelle just cut out!
 DATA / Attitude control has been restored.
 PICARD / Full stop. (beat) What happened?
 GEORDI / The starboard antimatter pod is completely drained. The fuel reserves are empty.
 PICARD / Is there a containment leak?
 GEORDI / (works) No sir. The containment field is intact... all engine systems are operational... The fuel is just gone.
 DATA / Geordi -- I believe I have an explanation. According to the plasma conversion sensor, the starboard engine has been in continuous operation for over forty-seven days.
 GEORDI / (reacts) Forty-seven days? Let's take a look at that sensor -- it must be malfunctioning.
 PICARD / I'll check the fuel consumption logs...
 TROI / What happened?
 PICARD / My hand...
 TROI / (off tricorder) The cells in your hand are metabolizing at an incredible rate... almost fifty times normal...
 PICARD / The pain is going away...
 TROI / Your metabolism is stabilizing...
 PICARD / It happened when I reached for the bowl of fruit.
 DATA / Captain. I am detecting a temporal disturbance which intersects the table. (beat) It would appear that within this disturbance, time is moving at a highly accelerated rate -- approximately fifty times faster than normal.
 DATA / (off console) The disturbance is roughly spherical in shape. It extends outward through the hull, approximately seventeen meters beyond the ship.
 GEORDI / (realizing) That would cover the starboard nacelle. No wonder it used up all its fuel.
 PICARD / (to Data) Check the hull integrity.
 DATA / It does not appear to be affected.
 PICARD / See if you can move us away from the disturbance, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / (working) Lateral thrusters on-line... (to Data) Data, plot a course away from the disturbance. Make sure it doesn't come in contact with our other engine.
 DATA / (working, to Geordi) Course plotted. Adjust pitch to twenty-seven point three degrees. Set heading one-eight-zero mark zero.
 GEORDI / Got it. Reversing at fifteen meters per second...
 DATA / (off console) We are clearing the phenomenon...
 DATA / (quickly) All stop.
 GEORDI / What's the matter?
 DATA / There is another temporal disturbance directly behind us.
 GEORDI / Captain, you'd better take a look at this...
 GEORDI / (off console) The sensors are picking up temporal disturbances throughout the region. Different configurations... different sizes... they're everywhere.
 DATA / (off graphic) Within each disturbance, it appears that time is moving at a different rate.
 GEORDI / It's almost like something shattered the space-time continuum...
 DATA / (off graphic) The fragmentation effect increases along a heading of two-seven-zero mark one-five.
 GEORDI / That's the direction of the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Can we navigate around these... "fragments"?
 GEORDI / We'll have to limit our maneuvering speed to one half impulse... but I think we can do it.
 PICARD / Get us to the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / These are the coordinates...
 PICARD / Perhaps they've been delayed...
 GEORDI / (off console) I've got the long range sensors on maximum, sir. No sign of the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / (working) But... I am picking up a faint reading... possibly metallic, but I can't tell for sure... (beat) The energy levels are practically non-existent.
 PICARD / Take us to it.
 GEORDI / Aye sir...
 DATA / (off console) The fragmentation effect is increasing...
 GEORDI / Slowing to one eighth impulse...
 PICARD / There she is...
 TROI / My God...
 PICARD / Mister Data... ?
 DATA / (off console) The Enterprise and the Warbird both appear to be trapped within one of the temporal fragments.
 GEORDI / The fragments seem to converge at this point... I'd say we're looking at the center of the temporal disturbances.
 PICARD / Scan for life signs.
 DATA / Sensors cannot penetrate the subspace field. I am unable to scan within the vessels.
 TROI / It looks like the Enterprise has been damaged... (points) There, on the starboard nacelle...
 GEORDI / The Warbird doesn't look damaged at all... I wonder if the Enterprise even got off a shot...
 TROI / The Romulans could've decloaked before the Enterprise had a chance to respond...
 PICARD / There's a second energy beam. It's coming from the Enterprise deflector array... any idea what it could be?
 DATA / It is impossible to tell from a visual inspection. But it appears to be focused on the Warbird's Engineering section.
 PICARD / We're not going to figure out what happened from here. We need to get aboard the Enterprise.
 DATA / That would be unadvisable, sir. In each of the three instances we came into contact with a temporal fragment, we were integrated into its time frame.
 GEORDI / (off that) If we beamed aboard the Enterprise, we'd be frozen in time, just like they are.
 PICARD / Then we've got to find a way to stay unfrozen...
 PICARD / Mister La Forge... what about a subspace forcefield like the one we used on Devidia Two? Could something like that protect us from the effects of the temporal fragment?
 GEORDI / Possibly. But we'd need a pretty sensitive phase discriminator to modulate that kind of field...
 DATA / The emergency Transporter armbands contain a type-seven phase discriminator. It should be possible to reconfigure their subspace emitters.
 GEORDI / Yeah... that would certainly isolate us from the effects of the other time frame...
 GEORDI / (continuing) But if we want to interact with that environment... we'd have to restrict the field. It would have to be practically skin-tight.
 DATA / I will attempt to narrow the field.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) This might work, Captain. But it's going to take some time...
 PICARD / It would seem that time is one thing we have plenty of...
 GEORDI / I've channeled communications through the subspace relays in the armbands. We'll be in continual contact.
 TROI / How long will the fields last?
 GEORDI / An hour, maybe less. Don't worry. I'll monitor you very carefully...
 DATA / Is there something wrong, Counselor?
 TROI / I got a little dizzy there for a second...
 GEORDI / We're generating an artificial pocket of time around you -- it's probably playing tricks on your equilibrium... (beat) It might take a little while to get used to. Let me know if it gets any worse.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Beam us directly to the Enterprise Bridge.
 GEORDI / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / Energizing...
 PICARD / Three Romulans... all armed with disruptors... one at Conn... (looks around) There are none of our security officers on the Bridge. They must've taken us by surprise....
 PICARD / It would appear that we can move objects in this time frame.
 TROI / (re: Riker) Maybe we can do something to help Wil...
 PICARD / I'm wary about making changes in this time continuum until we understand more about what's going on.
 DATA / None of the equipment is functioning. (studies console) However, the information currently displayed indicates that there was a massive power surge in Engineering.
 PICARD / (off console) Security teams had just been sent to Transporter Room Three... and Sickbay.
 PICARD / Counselor -- you go to Sickbay. Have a look around. Data, go to Main Engineering -- see if you can determine the cause of the power surge. I'll be in Transporter Room Three. (beat) Picard to La Forge.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge here, sir.
 PICARD / Lock onto our signals. I want you to beam Counselor Troi to --
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I'd rather not, Captain. We've got limited power... and your isolation fields consume a lot of energy.
 PICARD / Understood. We'll use the Jefferies Tubes. (to others) Let's go.
 PICARD / T-Sixteen is directly ahead -- it's the main junction for this section of the ship. We should have reasonably easy access to our destinations from there...
 TROI / Maybe we can get around them...
 PICARD / No. We'll find an alternate route. (beat) Let's go back up.
 BEVERLY is standing a few feet away with her arms / spread apart, body in mid-jolt, eyes wide with shock. A DISRUPTOR BLAST HAS PENETRATED HER CHEST -- THE GLOWING BEAM CAUGHT IN MID-FLASH. A nasty-looking HOLE has been burned through her chest.
 PICARD / Excuse me, Mister Worf...
 TROI / Captain...
 PICARD / Counselor. Take a look at this...
 PICARD / It appears that Mister Worf had just beamed these three aboard... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (off console) According to this, three other Romulans were beamed directly to Sickbay just seconds before.
 TROI / I know. I just saw them...
 PICARD / Why would we be transporting Romulans onto our ship in the middle of a battle?
 PICARD / (re: Romulans) They don't have any weapons... and that one looks injured. If they were part of an invasion, why are they unarmed? It doesn't make sense...
 TROI / (continuing) Captain... there's something I have to tell you... (beat) Doctor Crusher has been hit by a disruptor blast at point blank range... if time returns to normal, I don't see how she can survive.
 PICARD / There must be something we can do...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (fritzed) Data to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Picard here.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Please come to Engineering immediately. It is urgent.
 PICARD / What's the problem, Mister Data?
 DATA / I believe I have discovered the cause of the power surge. (beat) There is a warp core breach in progress.
 DATA / (re: explosion) It is the flashpoint of a warp core explosion. (beat) And it is expanding.
 PICARD / Expanding... I thought time was suspended on this ship.
 DATA / We were incorrect. I have determined that time is moving forward at an infinitesimal rate.
 TROI / Why didn't we notice it before?
 DATA / Our initial conclusion was based on our observations of the crew. A warp core breach moves at a much faster rate.
 DATA / (continuing) The motion of the cloud is within my visual detection threshold. Based on its current expansion rate, it will consume the ship in approximately nine hours, seventeen minutes.
 PICARD / Is there any way we can stop it?
 DATA / It is no longer a question of stopping it, sir. The explosion has already occurred -- The fact that it is moving slowly changes nothing.
 PICARD / Astonishing... to see it frozen like this...
 TROI / Do we know what caused the breach?
 DATA / No. However, the console displays indicate that there was a power transfer in progress from the Enterprise to the Romulan vessel at the moment time decelerated. (beat) That is why there is a second beam between the two ships.
 TROI / Why would we be sending them power?
 DATA / Perhaps we should go aboard the Romulan ship. The answer to that question may --
 DATA / Captain?
 TROI / Captain, what's wrong?
 PICARD / My head... dizzy... I can't...
 PICARD / No!
 TROI / Troi to La Forge. Get us out of here, now!
 GEORDI / It looks like you weren't completely protected from the effects of the other time continuum... (beat) The neuro-physical stress must've been overwhelming.
 DATA / In much the same way that deep sea divers can experience nitrogen narcosis -- you experienced a form of temporal narcosis.
 PICARD / Can we modify the subspace isolators to give us better protection?
 GEORDI / I don't think so. All we can do right now is be careful -- limit our exposure to their time frame. We probably shouldn't stay any longer than ten minutes per trip. And we should stick together while we're there... just in case.
 PICARD / Very well. Our next step is to find out why the Enterprise was transferring power to the Romulan ship. (to Troi) We'll begin our search in their engine room. Counselor -- you spent several days on a Romulan ship -- you know more about their lay-outs than anyone here. Perhaps you can --
 TROI / Captain. It might be better if you stayed here this time and gave yourself a chance to recover.
 PICARD / You're right... (to all) I'll monitor your progress from here. Ten minutes... no more.
 TROI / Geordi, there should be a power utilization monitor over there...
 DATA / (off console) This is highly unusual. The crew is not at Battle Stations. The ship is on Evacuation Alert.
 TROI / Is that why Romulans were being transported to the Enterprise... ?
 GEORDI / (to others) Take a look at this...
 GEORDI / (off console) There's an energy feedback returning through the transfer beam. It's probably what overloaded the Enterprise's engine... and caused the core breach.
 DATA / Perhaps the Warbird was trying to destroy the Enterprise.
 GEORDI / (off console) I don't think so. According to this, the Romulans were trying to shut down the power transfer.
 TROI / Whatever happened, this is beginning to look less and less like a Romulan attack...
 GEORDI / Let's take a look at their engine output.
 DATA / (off console, surprised) Geordi -- the engine core is completely inactive.
 TROI / (reacts) That's impossible. The Romulans use an artificial quantum singularity as their power source. Once it's activated, it can't be shut down.
 GEORDI / Maybe we should take a closer look....
 GEORDI / I think we found the problem...
 DATA / (off tricorder) It appears to be a highly focused aperture in the space-time continuum. Its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragments we observed earlier. However, it is approximately one point two million times as intense. (beat) I believe this may be the origin of the temporal fragmentation.
 TROI / What are these dark spots?
 DATA / (continuing, off tricorder) I am not certain. They exhibit complex bio-electric patterns. Very possibly organic.
 GEORDI / (surprised) Organic?
 DATA / From their molecular configuration, it would seem --
 DATA / The aperture is beginning to fluctuate. I believe we are --
 DATA / (to Picard) I believe my tricorder emissions caused the temporal aperture to activate. I suggest we avoid exposing it to any further energy emissions.
 PICARD / When time resumed, did you observe any activity in the engine room that suggested what the Romulans were doing?
 DATA / It appeared they were trying to eject the engine core.
 TROI / I thought I heard one of the Engineers say something about the power transfer. Something about an energy feedback...
 GEORDI / It looks like they were trying to stop whatever was happening here...
 PICARD / Mister La Forge -- from where you are can you determine what's happening on the Romulan Bridge?
 GEORDI / I think so...
 GEORDI / Wait... something's different here...
 GEORDI / Data... was this man always standing right here --
 TROI / (re: Geordi) He's going into neural shock!
 DATA / We must get him back to the Runabout.
 TROI / There's not enough time -- he's dying.
 TROI / At least this way, he'll be alive in the other time frame... we might have a chance to save him later. (beat) Is the Romulan still alive?
 DATA / (to Troi) Yes. However, I am getting unusual readings from his bioscan. (beat) I am not sure that he is a Romulan.
 DATA / (re: Romulan) His cellular structures do not conform to any known species, and his bio-electric patterns are in a state of temporal flux. (beat) I do not believe that this being is native to our time continuum.
 PICARD / Mister Data... you said you discovered organic matter within the temporal aperture...
 DATA / That is correct.
 PICARD / I want to take a closer look at those readings.
 DATA / (re: graphic) This is a bio-spectral analysis of the temporal aperture. (indicates dark spots) The organic readings originated from these dark spots.
 PICARD / They appear to contain some sort of energy patterns... (beat) Can you isolate one of them and magnify?
 PICARD / (off graphic) It looks like a cellular cluster...
 DATA / Its bio-electric patterns are similar to that of the alien. However, it is significantly less complex. (beat) The cellular structures appear to be in a state of mitosis.
 PICARD / Data. This could be some sort of... embryo...
 DATA / It is possible. If I could scan the aperture further, I might be able to --
 TROI (O.S.) / Captain.
 PICARD / (to Romulan) Who are you?
 TROI / Why are you here?
 PICARD / Who was in danger?
 TROI / Artificial... gravity well... (realizes) You mean, the Romulan engine core?
 DATA / His molecular structure is destabilizing.
 PICARD / How did your young become trapped in the core?
 DATA / Captain -- I believe his species mistook the artificial singularity, which the Romulans use in their engine, for a natural one... a black hole. They tried to use it as a nest.
 TROI / That's what deactivated the Warbird's engine core... so the Romulans sent out a distress call...
 PICARD / (off that) The Enterprise responded... found the Warbird suffering an apparent engine failure... and attempted a power transfer.
 DATA / (interpreting) I believe that when the power transfer made contact with the alien nest, it disrupted the space-time continuum.
 PICARD / (realizing) Was it you who attacked the Enterprise?
 PICARD / Are there others like you here?
 PICARD / Do you know where he is? Can he help us restore normal time?
 DATA / I estimate the core breach will consume the Enterprise in approximately seven hours, two minutes.
 PICARD / Is there a way to lock onto the core itself... beam it into space?
 DATA / No, sir. We would need to surround the core with a subspace isolation field. It is not possible to generate a field of that magnituide from the Runabout.
 PICARD / Mister Data... when you scanned the temporal aperture with your tricorder... it caused time to move forward, and back again...
 DATA / That is correct.
 PICARD / What if we found a way to reverse that process -- make time move backward... then forward.
 TROI / (onto the idea) We might be able to run time back to a point before the warp core breach occurred... and then find a way to prevent the power transfer. So when time moves forward again...
 PICARD / ... The breach won't happen.
 DATA / I can attempt to modify the tricorder's scan frequency. It might allow us to manipulate the temporal aperture's effects.
 PICARD / Make it so, Data.
 PICARD / If this works, we may not have much time to prevent the power transfer. We'll have to decide precisely where to be and what to do the instant time begins to move backwards...
 DATA / (to com) Captain -- I have placed the tricorder in the Romulan engine room. Standing by.
 PICARD / (to com) Acknowledged. Counselor -- are you in position?
 TROI / (to com) Ready, sir.
 PICARD / Alright, Mister Data.
 DATA / Initiating tricorder emissions...
 DATA / (off console) Captain -- the warp core breach has been reversed.
 PICARD / Be ready, Mister Data.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / (to N.D.) You must not initiate the power transfer.
 DATA / We must shut it down.
 DATA / (quickly, to computer) Computer -- place a Level three containment field around the warp core.
 RIKER / Captain?
 PICARD / (quickly) No time to explain, Number One. Continue the evacuation of the Romulan ship. You'll find LaForge in the Romulan engine room -- beam him directly to Sickbay.
 TROI / (to Romulan, a threat) Step away -- now.
 BEVERLY / Deanna, it's okay -- he wasn't firing at me.
 BEVERLY / Where did she go... ?
 PICARD / Status, Mister Data?
 DATA / (to com) I was attacked by another alien, sir. I was unable to prevent the power transfer.
 DATA / (continuing) It cannot be disengaged and the containment field will fail in seventeen seconds. (beat) A core breach is again imminent.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Can we move the ship?
 RIKER / The feedback from the transfer beam would tear us apart.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Patch me into the navigational control on the Runabout.
 RIKER / Got it!
 PICARD / I'm bringing the Runabout in...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Mister Data?
 DATA / (to com) The core breach has been prevented, sir.
 PICARD / (off console) Data -- it appears that severing the power transfer has not only prevented the core breach, but has also restored space-time to normal.
 DATA / The alien who attacked me has vanished, sir.
 PICARD / The Warbird has vanished as well.
 DATA / (off tricorder) Judging from the residual temporal fluctuations... I believe they have returned to their own time continuum.
 RIKER / Captain?
 PICARD / It's going to take a little time to explain, Number One...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 46945.3. We successfully evacuated the crew of the Romulan ship. We're on course to the Neutral Zone to bring them home.
 DATA / Come in.
 RIKER / (to Data) Where's that cat of yours?
 DATA / Spot is sleeping, sir. Why do you ask?
 RIKER / No reason...
 RIKER / I've worked out the new rotation schedules. I'd like you to cross check the personnel assignments and notify all department heads. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (beat) Your new Bridge shift begins at twenty-three hundred hours.
 DATA / Understood, sir.
 RIKER / Data, what are you doing?
 DATA / Recent events have compelled me to study how humans perceive the passage of time. (beat) For example, I have often heard people comment that time seems to pass more "slowly" in one instance, or more "quickly" in another. Yet in reality, the actual passage of time remains fixed.
 RIKER / I guess everybody perceives time a little differently... it depends on the exact situation... how you're feeling...
 DATA / I have been testing the aphorism that "a watched pot never boils". (beat) I have boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty-two times. In some cases, I ignored the kettle. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / In others, I watched it intently. In every instance, the water reached its boiling point in precisely fifty-one point seven seconds.
 DATA / It would appear that I am not capable of perceiving time any differently than my internal chronometer.
 RIKER / Why don't you turn it off?
 DATA / Sir?
 RIKER / Data... people don't have internal chronometers. See what happens when you turn yours off.
 DATA / Thank you, Commander. I will try that.
 RIKER / Just don't be late for your shift.
 DATA / Quite amusing, Professor Hawking. (to Newton) You see, Sir Isaac, the joke depends on an understanding of the relativistic curvature of spacetime. If two non-inertial reference frames are in relative motion--
 DATA / That story is generally considered to be apocryphal.
 DATA / (matches the bet) I am in. When I play poker with my shipmates, I often find that it is a useful forum for exploring different facets of humanity. I was curious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact in this setting. So far it has proved most illuminating.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Red Alert. All personnel report to duty stations.
 DATA / (stands) We will have to continue this at another time. (to com) End program.
 PICARD ENTERS from the aft Turbolift and moves toward / RIKER, who is standing at one of the aft science / stations. WORF and TROI are at their stations, an N.D. at Conn. Data ENTERS from the forward Turbolift and moves to Ops. The ship is on Red Alert.
 RIKER / (to Picard) We've received a distress call from the Ohniaka Three Outpost. They said they were under attack.
 PICARD / (puzzled) Ohniaka Three... there's no strategic value to that outpost. Were they able to identify the attackers?
 RIKER / No, sir. And we haven't been able to raise them since the initial call.
 WORF / We are nearing the Ohniaka system, Captain.
 PICARD / (to Con) Bring us out of warp, Ensign.
 WORF / Sensors detect one ship orbiting the third planet... its configuration does not match anything in our records.
 RIKER / Stand-by phasers and photon torpedoes.
 PICARD / Hail them, Mister Worf.
 WORF / (works) No response.
 PICARD / Put them onscreen.
 DATA / It does not appear to be attacking the outpost.
 RIKER / They might have attacked before we got here.
 PICARD / Or they might simply be another victim. (beat, to Data) What about the outpost on the surface?
 DATA / (works) There is a great deal of electromagnetic interference... I am unable to determine whether there are any lifeforms present.
 RIKER / Data, Worf, you're with me.
 WORF / (off-tricorder) These wounds were caused by a forced-plasma beam... similar to a Ferengi hand phaser.
 RIKER / This seems pretty brutal for the Ferengi. (to Data) Can you detect any survivors?
 DATA / (off tricorder) The electro-magnetic interference is still making it difficult to get precise sensor readings.
 RIKER / How many people were assigned to this outpost?
 WORF / Two hundred seventy-four.
 RIKER / All right... we'll make a room to room search. Worf -- you, and Corelki start searching the north wing, we'll take the south.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 DATA / The mechanism appears to be jammed.
 RIKER / There's not much damage... doesn't look like they were interested in the station... just the people...
 DATA / I have by-passed the primary system.
 PICARD / (to Con) Evasive maneuvers, Ensign! (to Tactical) Return fire.
 GEORDI / Shields are down to eighty percent... compensating with auxiliary power.
 DATA / (a shout) Stop it!
 DATA / Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
 GEORDI / Captain, the alien ship is breaking orbit.
 PICARD / (to Con) Set an intercept course, Ensign. (to Tactical) Fire torpedoes.
 GEORDI / Shields are back to full power, Captain.
 PICARD / Very good.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / They're gone, sir. Our sensors indicate there was some kind of subspace distortion just before they disappeared... I'll have to study these readings before I can get more specific.
 PICARD / Take us back to Ohniaka Three.
 RIKER / (gently) Data? (beat) Data, are you all right?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / What happened?
 DATA / I got angry.
 PICARD (V.O) / Captain's Log: Stardate 46982.1. Because of his unusual behavior on the planet surface, Commander Data has asked to be temporarily relieved of duty. Unfortunately, this means he will not be able to help us investigate a disturbing new change in the behavior of the Borg.
 RIKER / They were fast, aggressive -- almost vicious... it was more like fighting Klingons than Borg, (to Worf) No offense.
 WORF / None taken.
 RIKER / There was another difference. I don't think they were part of the Borg collective... they acted more like individuals.
 PICARD / (shocked) What?
 RIKER / One of them referred to himself as "I".
 WORF / That Borg also showed concern for a fallen comrade... and called him by name.
 TROI / The only Borg who ever had a name... was Hugh. And we gave it to him.
 BEVERLY / Maybe Hugh has something to do with this change in their behavior.
 PICARD / Did they show any interest in... assimilating you... or your technology?
 RIKER / They seemed more concerned with the death of their colleague... and with destroying us... I didn't see anything that suggested they wanted to assimilate anyone.
 PICARD / The Borg's entire existence was centered around the acquisition of technology and cultures... if that is no longer the case... then they must have a new objective. We have to find out what it is. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) Mister Worf, from this moment on, we will maintain security condition two. Have armed officers posted on every deck.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Number One, analyze our sensor readings of the Borg ship... try to determine whether it's something they constructed or an alien ship they captured. Then, run an analysis of this... subspace distortion they used to escape.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I'm going to contact Starfleet Command.
 GEORDI / Your positronic net checks out... everything looks fine.
 DATA / My internal diagnostic also found nothing wrong.
 GEORDI / I don't know what to say, Data. There's nothing here to indicate anything that would cause a behavioral anomaly.
 DATA / I agree. (beat) Geordi, I believe I experienced my first emotion.
 GEORDI / Data... no offense, but how would you know an actual flash of anger from some kind of odd power surge?
 DATA / You are correct in that I have no frame of reference to confirm my hypothesis. (beat) In fact, I find myself unable to provide a verbal description of the experience. Perhaps you could describe what it feels like when you get angry... I could then use that as a reference.
 GEORDI / Well... when I get angry, first I... begin to feel... hostile...
 DATA / Could you describe feeling hostile?
 GEORDI / It's feeling... belligerent... combative...
 DATA / Can you describe feeling angry without referring to other feelings?
 GEORDI / No. I guess I can't. I just... feel angry.
 DATA / That was my experience as well. I simply... felt angry.
 GEORDI / Let's say that you're right... and this was an emotion. How is that possible?
 DATA / I do not know. Perhaps I have evolved to the point where emotions are within my reach. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (beat) Perhaps I will experience other emotions as time goes on.
 GEORDI / I hope you're right. I'd hate to think that anger is all you're capable of feeling.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 46984.6 No additional Borg attacks have been reported in the past two days. However, Starfleet has dispatched Admiral Nechayev to take command in this sector in preparation for a possible Borg invasion.
 PICARD / Understood.
 PICARD / I thought I made my reasons clear.
 PICARD / Once Hugh was separated from the Borg collective he began to... grow and evolve into something more than just an automaton. He was a person. When that happened, I had no choice but to respect his rights as an individual.
 PICARD / (tight) No one is more aware of the danger than I am. But I am also bound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles. And I will not sacrifice them in order to--
 PICARD / (tight) Yes, sir.
 DATA / For the past six hours, I have attempted to produce an emotional response by subjecting myself to various stimuli.
 TROI / Like what?
 DATA / I listened to several operas known to be uplifting, I watched three Holodeck programs designed to be humorous, and I made four attempts to induce sexual desire by subjecting myself to erotic imagery.
 TROI / What happened?
 DATA / Nothing.
 TROI / I'm curious... why are you ignoring the one emotion you've already experienced? Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again?
 DATA / Anger is a negative emotion. I wanted to concentrate on something more positive.
 TROI / Feelings aren't positive or negative Data, they simply exist. It's what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad. (beat) For example, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it.
 DATA / But my study of humanity indicates there are some emotions that are harmful, such as jealousy or hatred.
 TROI / Those are very... strong emotions, and you're right -- there's very little good that can come from them. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / But, I don't think that an exploration of anger would necessarily lead to feelings of hate or malice.
 DATA / But what if it does, Counselor? What if it turns out that those are the only emotions I am capable of experiencing? Would that not make me a... bad person?
 TROI / Data, we've served together a long time... and I've gotten to know you pretty well... I have to believe if you ever do reach your goal of becoming human... you won't become a bad one.
 DATA / I wish I were as confident as you are, Counselor. (beat) When I was fighting the Borg, I felt angry... but as I think back on that incident, I realize that I also experienced another sensation. It was not the same as anger, but I think it was an emotion.
 TROI / Exactly when did you feel this... other emotion?
 DATA / It was just after I had killed the Borg. I looked down at his body and I.... felt something.
 TROI / If you had to put a name to this... feeling, what would you call it?
 DATA / I believe it was pleasure.
 RIKER / Red Alert! All hands to battle stations. (to Con) Lay in a course and engage at warp nine.
 RIKER / (to Picard) We have a distress call from the New Berlin Colony. They're under attack.
 PICARD / (to Data) What's our ETA?
 WORF / At warp nine, we will arrive in fifteen minutes, thirty seconds.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Contact the Crazy Horse, and the Agamemnon, tell them to stand-by in case we --
 WORF / Incoming message, Captain. It's the New Berlin Colony. (MORE)
 WORF (Cont'd) / (beat) They are... cancelling their distress call. Evidently a Ferengi trading ship entered their system and someone panicked.
 RIKER / That's the third time today. (to Con) Reduce speed and bring us back to our patrol route.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... stand down from Red Alert. Acknowledge the signal from New Berlin, and then transmit another copy of Starfleet's ship recognition protocols... and tell them to read it this time.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Supplemental. We have been on patrol for seventeen hours, and there are still no reports of any further Borg activity. But tensions continue to run high on the colonies and outposts in this sector.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / (hands Picard the PADD) I thought you'd like to see this. It's Geordi's analysis of the subspace distortion the Borg used to escape.
 PICARD / (reading) "... an artificially created energy conduit." (tosses PADD on table in irritation) That could be anything.
 RIKER / We don't have enough information at this point to --
 PICARD / I don't want excuses, Number One. I want answers.
 PICARD / (softer) Sorry.
 PICARD / He was right here, Wil... in this very room. And I let him go. (beat) Pick any five starship Captains... give them a chance to rid the Federation of a mortal threat. (beat) I would wager that all five would do it... even if it meant sacrificing the rights of one man.
 RIKER / I don't mean to sound melodramatic... but I've never thought of you as just "any other starship Captain." Sending Hugh back to the Borg was a very risky, a very dangerous choice... but it was the moral thing to do.
 PICARD / It may turn out that the moral thing to do... was not the right thing to do.
 DATA / Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
 GEORDI / Data... am I interrupting something?
 DATA / Yes. But it is all right. Do you need me?
 GEORDI / Well, I wanted to see if you were ready to return to duty. I need some help on an analysis of the ship the Borg were using.
 DATA / I believe I am able to resume my duties.
 GEORDI / What are you doing in here?
 DATA / I am attempting to recreate the experience which led to my initial burst of anger.
 GEORDI / Any luck?
 DATA / None so far. (beat) I have nearly completed this experiment. May I finish before we return to Engineering?
 GEORDI / Sure, go ahead.
 DATA / (to com) Computer, reset Borg simulation to time index two point one. Increase Borg strength by twenty percent.
 DATA / Run program.
 DATA / Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
 DATA / (to com) Computer, reset simulation to time index two point one. Increase Borg strength by thirty percent.
 DATA / The computer will require the voice authorizations of two senior officers in order to disable the safety routine. Will you help me?
 GEORDI / (concerned) Whoa, wait a minute. (re: Borg) That thing could kill you.
 DATA / During the original incident the Borg presented a genuine danger to my life. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / With the Holodeck safety routine in place, I know that my life is not in danger. Since I am trying to duplicate the conditions of the original incident as closely as possible I must attempt to duplicate the jeopardy as well.
 GEORDI / (angry) Data, We're talking about an experiment. You can't put your life on the line just to prove a theory.
 DATA / This experiment may hold the key to something which I have sought all my life.
 GEORDI / (firm) This is crazy. There's got to be another way. Why don't you try something else to make yourself angry...
 DATA / I have tried other stimuli, but they have been unsuccessful. I understand your objections, but it is my life and I have the right to risk it if I choose.
 GEORDI / Well, I'm your friend and I'm not going to just stand by and let you do this.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Red Alert, all hands to battle stations.
 RIKER / It's confirmed. The MS One colony is under attack.
 PICARD / Doesn't it seem strange that there have been two Borg attacks... and the Enterprise was the nearest ship in both instances?
 DATA / We are nearing the MS system, sir.
 WORF / I have located the Borg ship. It is heading away from the colony.
 PICARD / (to Con Officer) Take us out of warp near that ship.
 RIKER / Stand-by to lock phasers on target.
 WORF / We are within visual range.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Lay in an intercept course, full impulse. (to Worf) Lock phasers.
 WORF / We are closing... we will be within phaser range in thirty seconds.
 DATA / Captain... sensors detect a subspace distortion forming directly ahead of the Borg ship.
 PICARD / They're not going to get away this time. (to com) Picard to Engineering. Transfer auxiliary and emergency power to the impulse engines.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 DATA / Impulse engines now at one hundred twenty-five percent.
 WORF / We will be in phaser range... in ten seconds.
 DATA / We are caught in some kind of energy (TECH).
 RIKER / All engines back full.
 WORF / Shields are failing.
 DATA / We are being pulled inside.
 WORF / (urgent) Inertial dampers failing.
 DATA / Main power is off-line. I am switching to back-ups.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Engineering, can you transfer auxiliary power to the warp nacelles? Try to break us out by using the --
 PICARD / Report.
 DATA / (off console) We have returned to normal space. Navigational systems are still offline... I will attempt to make a celestial fix using secondary systems.
 WORF / Captain, the Borg ship is directly ahead! It's coming about!
 PICARD / On-screen.
 RIKER / Evasive maneuvers.
 WORF / (works, frustrated) Shields are down to sixteen percent, Captain.
 PICARD / Is everyone else all right?
 WORF / Security reports no other intruders aboard. (works, then puzzled) Captain... the Borg ship is gone.
 WORF / Sensor logs indicate they entered the distortion field thirty seconds ago.
 PICARD / (speculating) They beamed aboard as a diversion... to give their ship time to escape.
 RIKER / (re: Borg) This is another change in Borg behavior... they left their dead behind instead of vaporizing them.
 DATA / Captain... this one is still alive.
 BEVERLY / I've stabilized his condition. He's still pretty weak, but he should make a full recovery.
 PICARD / Can you wake him?
 BEVERLY / Yes, but I don't think it's a good idea. His blood pressure and heart rate are --
 PICARD / Do it.
 BEVERLY / All right.
 PICARD / (to Security Guard) Lower the forcefield.
 PICARD / What is your designation?
 PICARD / Crosis... ? How did you get that name?
 PICARD / Who is that?
 PICARD / You are Borg... your goal is not to destroy us... it's to assimilate us into the collective.
 PICARD / Tell me more about the One... does he have a name? (beat) Is he called Hugh?
 PICARD / Why does the One wish to destroy biological organisms?
 PICARD / (hard) I am Locutus of Borg. You will respond to my questions.
 PICARD / This is going nowhere. Doctor, I want an autopsy performed on the other one. Compare the results to what we learned about Hugh's anatomy... see if there are any recent modifications which could explain the behavioral differences. (to Data) Run a bio-spectral analysis... see if this Borg is trying to send a subspace signal to the others.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 DATA / I do not wish to be assimilated.
 DATA / Yes. On Ohniaka Three, I was forced to kill a Borg... and I got angry.
 DATA / It would be unethical to take pleasure from another being's death.
 DATA / (difficult) Yes.
 DATA / That is incorrect. My creator, Doctor Soong, gave me a program which defines my sense of right and wrong. In essence, I have a conscience.
 DATA / Step away from the forcefield. Your proximity is interfering with my scan.
 DATA / It was... a very... potent experience...
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / No. That would not... be ethical.
 DATA / Yes... his name is Geordi.
 DATA / Yes. I would.
 GEORDI / Our current theory is that the Borg have established several transwarp conduits through subspace. A ship entering a conduit is immediately accelerated to an extremely high warp velocity. It's like falling into a fast-moving river and getting swept away by the current.
 PICARD / How fast would a ship travel through one of these conduits?
 GEORDI / We don't know... normal subspace limitations don't apply to transwarp variables. Based on the distance we covered in our trip through the conduit, I'd say the speed is at least twenty times faster than our maximum warp.
 RIKER / How do they open the conduits?
 GEORDI / The Borg ship emitted some kind of high energy tachyon pulse just before we saw the subspace distortion. It seems as though the conduits are keyed to respond to tachyon transmissions on a specific frequency.
 PICARD / Is there any way for us to duplicate the --
 WORF / Captain. There is a shuttlecraft leaving bay two.
 PICARD / Who authorized a launch?
 WORF / There was no authorization.
 PICARD / Picard to shuttlecraft. Identify yourself and return to the ship immediately.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Lock onto it with a tractor beam and bring it back.
 WORF / The tractor beam has been disabled... command overrides are not functioning.
 GEORDI / Captain, I'm picking up a tachyon surge... I think whoever's in the shuttle is trying to trigger the transwarp conduit.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Can you tell who's on board?
 WORF / (shocked) It is... the Borg prisoner... and Commander Data.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, can we follow them into the conduit?
 GEORDI / We got a good reading on the tachyon pulse they sent. We might be able to duplicate it.
 PICARD / (to Riker) The question is... is Data a prisoner... or did he go willingly?
 WORF / The command overrides used to disable the tractor were Commander Data's.
 RIKER / The Borg might've taken the codes from Data by force...
 PICARD / Or perhaps Data's recent flash of... emotion has something to do with this. It may have affected him more profoundly than we realize. Either way, we have to find him.
 GEORDI / I've set up a temporary tachyon matrix in the main deflector. I think I can use it to simulate the pulse sent by the shuttle.
 PICARD / Very well. Red Alert, Mister Worf.
 RIKER / All hands to battle stations.
 PICARD / (to Con) Bring us to the shuttle's last known coordinates.
 WORF / Shields up... weapons ready.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / I'm energizing the matrix... emitting tachyons in the lower bandwidth.
 WORF / Sensors show no unusual subspace activity.
 GEORDI / All right... I'm switching to the secondary bandwidth. (beat) Nothing. (he frowns) Maybe if I start alternating the frequencies...
 WORF / Commander -- there is an energy fluctuation directly ahead... it is the subspace distortion...
 PICARD / (to Con) Take us in, Ensign. One half impulse.
 WORF / Power levels have dropped to sixty-seven percent.
 GEORDI / Compensating with auxiliary power.
 PICARD / Report.
 RIKER / Navigational sensors show we've traveled sixty-five light years from our previous position.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Can you locate the shuttle?
 WORF / (works) No, sir. It is not within sensor range.
 RIKER / Maybe we can find an energy signature from their engines.
 GEORDI / Captain, you should take a look at this.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I've scanned three star systems within sensor range... there's evidence of at least two advanced civilizations... but I'm reading no life signs. (beat) And there are indications that plasma weapons have been fired in those systems recently.
 PICARD / (grim) The Borg have been busy.
 RIKER / I think we've found the shuttle's energy signature.
 WORF / They were heading... two four seven, mark zero five nine.
 PICARD / (to Con) Lay in that course and engage at full impulse.
 RIKER / We've traced the shuttle's energy signature to this point on the surface... but there's too much interference to scan the location.
 PICARD / Are they intentionally jamming our sensors?
 GEORDI / It looks more like a natural phenomenon... there's an unusually high amount of EM activity in the planet's magnetosphere.
 PICARD / Can we transport through the interference?
 GEORDI / I think so... but there could be fifty Borg down there waiting for us and we'd have no way of knowing it.
 RIKER / I'd say it's a risk we have to take.
 PICARD / Agreed. Take a well-armed Away Team and beam down to those coordinates. Have the Transporter Chief maintain a continuous lock on your signals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. Mister Worf.
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Riker to Enterprise. We're on the surface... no sign of any Borg or Data. (moves to the shuttle) The shuttlecraft has been abandoned.
 WORF / The EM interference is limiting the tricorder range... it is useless beyond one hundred meters.
 RIKER / There aren't any structures down here. They could've gone anywhere, Captain.
 PICARD / (to com) Can you determine how long ago they left the shuttlecraft?
 RIKER / (off console) The engine's been shut down for a little over three hours.
 PICARD / (to com) Stand-by, Number One. (to Geordi) Assuming they're still together, how far could they have traveled in three hours?
 GEORDI / (thinks) Data can move pretty fast, even over rough terrain... but based on what we know about the Borg, I don't think they can move any faster than you or I. (works) They could be... as much as twenty kilometers from the shuttle by now.
 PICARD / (beat, then to com) Picard to Riker.
 RIKER / Riker here.
 PICARD / I'm going to start sending down other Away Teams. Set up a command post and begin mapping out a search plan.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Understood, sir.
 PICARD / Picard out.
 PICARD / (continuing) I want to use shuttlecraft for lowlevel reconnaissance. Have the designated pilots report to the main shuttlebay.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / All available personnel -- including you and me -- will begin assembling four man Away Teams. We'll leave a skeleton crew aboard the ship.
 GEORDI / Who'll be in command of the Enterprise?
 BEVERLY / Any last orders?
 PICARD / If the Borg should attack... don't wait for me or anyone else to get back to the ship. Take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit and return to Federation space.
 BEVERLY / Got it.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Good luck, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / Good luck... Captain.
 RIKER / I've sent out twelve teams so far. (points to console screen) I've assigned your team to search section gamma two-five. Worf and I will take theta one-six once the final team is down.
 PICARD / Who's manning the command post?
 RIKER / Wallace and Towles.
 PICARD / Ready?
 PICARD / Anything, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / Nothing, sir.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, what if we modified one of our phasers to send out a luvetric pulse? It might cause a resonance fluctuation in Data's power cells...
 GEORDI / (nods) And then we could home in on that response with our tricorders. I thought about that. The problem is that the pulse would have to be so powerful that it would probably destroy Data's entire positronic net in the process.
 TROI / Captain. (she looks in another direction) I think I've found something.
 PICARD / Come on.
 GEORDI / I'm having trouble scanning the interior...
 PICARD / Can you tell if it was built by the Borg?
 GEORDI / I don't think so. There aren't any Borg energy signatures. (looks at tricorder for a moment) There's a door or a hatch or something about twenty meters that way.
 TROI / It seems to be some kind of meeting hall.
 PICARD / It's been well maintained... it doesn't look like it's been abandoned.
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) Something's wrong... I can't get any kind of energy signature from this light source.
 PICARD / (urgent) A dampening field. The whole structure could be shielded from our sensors. Let's go.
 PICARD / Data... ?
 TROI / That's not Data...
 PICARD / (surprised, to Troi) What do you mean?
 PICARD / (shocked) Lore...
 DATA / The Sons of Soong have joined together... (beat) ... and together, we will destroy the Federation.
 BEVERLY'S V.O. / Acting Captain's Log, Supplemental: The skeleton crew left on board the Enterprise is unable to help in the search for Commander Data. The planet's unusual EM field is interfering with the ship's sensors, severely limiting their effectiveness.
 BEVERLY / Without our sensors, we're sitting ducks. A Borg ship could be right on top of us before we knew it... (turns to Tactical) Ensign, we need to modify the sensor array to filter out these EM pulses. Can you do that?
 BEVERLY / What's your name?
 BEVERLY / I don't think I've seen you before.
 BEVERLY / Well, Taitt -- I'll bet you never thought you'd be serving as Tactical Officer after only six weeks.
 BEVERLY / (approvingly) Good work.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / Go ahead, Wil.
 RIKER, WORF and two N.D.s. / 
 RIKER / I can't contact the Captain. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / It might just be the interference, but I'd like to be sure.
 BEVERLY / Understood. (beat) Enterprise to Captain Picard.
 BEVERLY / Crusher to Picard.
 BEVERLY / The last time they checked-in they were investigating a structure in section gamma two-five.
 BEVERLY / Is it a Borg ship?
 BEVERLY / Red Alert. How long before they're in weapons range?
 BEVERLY / (to com) Crusher to Transporter Room Three.
 BEVERLY / Start transporting the Away Teams off the surface.
 BEVERLY / Use the transporters in the cargo bays if you have to. I want those teams up here as fast as possible.
 RIKER / (to an N.D.) Armstrong, you and the others get ready to beam up. (to com) Beverly, Worf and I will stay here and look for the Captain's team.
 BEVERLY / I'm not going to leave you down there --
 RIKER / (firm) Pull as many people off the surface as you can and get back to the transwarp conduit. The Captain's orders were to get the Enterprise to Federation space.
 BEVERLY / Acknowledged.
 RIKER / Riker, out.
 BEVERLY / (to con officer) Prepare to leave orbit.
 BEVERLY / (to com) Salazar, how many people are still down there?
 BEVERLY / Put the Borg ship on screen.
 BEVERLY / Not yet. I want to keep bringing people up until the last possible second.
 BEVERLY / Stand by to raise shields and break orbit on my mark.
 BEVERLY / Mark.
 BEVERLY / Establish a frequency-shift firing pattern and return fire.
 BEVERLY / Helm, set course for the conduit, maximum warp.
 BEVERLY / (to com) Salazar, how many people did we leave behind?
 BEVERLY / (to herself) Another minute and we could have had them...
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Riker to any team leader.
 RIKER / Round up everyone who was left behind. Take cover and try to avoid any contact with the Borg.
 RIKER / Riker, out.
 RIKER / Even if Beverly gets back to Federation space, it'll be a few days before Starfleet can get any ships here... until then, we're on our own.
 PICARD / I'm not particularly impressed. You've simply taught them to enjoy killing.
 DATA / You are wrong, Captain. My brother and I serve a much higher purpose.
 TROI / Data... I can sense feelings in you.
 DATA / Yes. My brother has made it possible.
 PICARD / (realizing) He gave you the chip -- the one Doctor Soong made for you.
 TROI / Then you're responsible for bringing him here.
 GEORDI / (surprised) You mean... you attacked those outposts... killed all those people... just to get Data here with you?
 PICARD / How did he do it, Data? What made you decide to come here?
 PICARD / You're controlling him. And you've corrupted the Borg.
 PICARD / I'd like to learn about it. But I want Data to tell us.
 PICARD / How do you like that, Data? He won't even let you talk.
 DATA / Do not try to drive a wedge between us, Captain. I am loyal to my brother.
 TROI / Are you saying you caused them to become individuals?
 DATA / Hugh interfaced with the others and transferred his sense of individuality to them. It almost destroyed them.
 PICARD / Data, do you remember when Hugh was on the Enterprise? Do you remember what you were like then?
 PICARD / It does to me. I want to know what's happened to Data.
 DATA / The Borg aspire to the perfection my Brother and I represent: fully artificial life forms. We are their future.
 WORF / (off tricorder) Still no sign of the structure.
 RIKER / With all this interference it could be a hundred meters away and we wouldn't know it. (frustrated) This could take hours.
 WORF / I am detecting a faint energy reading.
 RIKER / Residual thermal traces... someone stopped here...
 WORF / (also scanning) The decay rate indicates they were human...
 RIKER / They followed this path...
 PICARD / You must realize that something has happened to you. The Data I know would not be a willing party to Lore's plan.
 DATA / I now realize that my life aboard the Enterprise was a waste. My quest to become human was misguided, an evolutionary step in the wrong direction.
 TROI / Data, all I'm sensing from you is anger... hatred -- have you felt any other emotions?
 DATA / There are no other emotions.
 TROI / What about love... joy?
 DATA / Those are words without substance. Love is nothing more than the absence of hate. Joy is the absence of fear.
 GEORDI / Just because you haven't experienced certain emotions doesn't mean they don't exist.. Lore is just feeding you the negative ones.
 DATA / Counselor Troi herself told me that feelings are not positive or negative, it is how we act on them that becomes good or bad.
 PICARD / Fine. Then what about the things Lore is proposing? What about the lives that have already been lost?
 DATA / You do not understand. In a quest such as ours, sacrifices must be made. It is regrettable. But the greater good must be served.
 DATA / Give me your Visor.
 GEORDI / (disbelieving) Why?
 DATA / Give it to me or I will take it by force.
 DATA / I am not your puppet anymore.
 BEVERLY / Right. Stand by to trigger the conduit.
 BEVERLY / Taitt.
 BEVERLY / I'd like you to stay on the Bridge. I'll need a Science Officer at the Aft Station.
 BEVERLY / Helm, set a course back to the planet.
 BEVERLY / I'm not leaving those people stranded back there. An emergency buoy can transmit a copy of our log entries to Starfleet just as easily as we can. (to Taitt) Ensign, prepare a buoy and launch it when you're ready.
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant, open the conduit.
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant, scan for any Borg ships between here and the planet.
 BEVERLY / How long will we have before they can detect us and intercept?
 BEVERLY / (to com) Crusher to Salazar... how long will it take to get the rest of the crew off the surface?
 BEVERLY / We don't have one minute. How much can you shave off that?
 BEVERLY / (to Bridge crew) We need to buy ourselves fifteen seconds. (beat) Is there any way we can use the planet as a barrier... to keep the Borg from realizing we're in orbit?
 BEVERLY / Let's go for it. Helm, hard about.
 DATA / Here is the VISOR. May I ask why you wanted it?
 DATA / All the Borg you have experimented on so far have suffered extensive brain damage.
 DATA / I understand.
 GEORDI / Lore must have told Data to take my VISOR because he realized I could see a carrier wave radiating from him.
 PICARD / A carrier wave... is that how he's manipulating Data?
 GEORDI / I think what's happening is that Lore is tapping into the chip he stole from Doctor Soong. He's found a way to transmit part of that emotional program to Data.
 TROI / But the only emotions Data seems to feel are negative.
 GEORDI / I'm sure that's intentional. But for those emotions to affect Data, Lore would have had to disable his ethical program first...
 PICARD / Can we reactivate it?
 GEORDI / (musing) If I could generate a phased kedion pulse at the right frequency, it would trigger Data's subsystems and reboot the program.
 PICARD / Lore would still be feeding him negative emotions, but at least Data might listen to us.
 TROI / I think it's worth a try.
 GEORDI / (wry) So... got any ideas on how we can generate a kedion pulse?
 PICARD / Where are you taking him?
 DATA / That's not your concern.
 PICARD / Data, wait -- let us talk to you --
 WORF / Commander, we have found it.
 RIKER / Hugh... ?
 WORF / You blame us -- for what has happened to the Borg?
 RIKER / We considered it. We knew it was a possibility...
 WORF / I do not accept that. Lore is only one man. The Borg could have stopped him.
 RIKER / And then -- Lore came along.
 WORF / Even if that voice insists on controlling you?
 RIKER / What's happened to them?
 RIKER / I'm sorry you feel that way.
 RIKER / We came here to get our people. I don't want to cause you any more trouble...
 RIKER / Friend?
 RIKER / I wish I could tell you. We think he's being held inside the compound.
 RIKER / (beat) Will you at least show us how to get into the compound?
 WORF / Show us. If we can determine the geography of the compound, we can form a rescue plan.
 GEORDI / Data?
 GEORDI / (continuing) Is somebody there?
 DATA / (Picard's voice) Geordi...
 GEORDI / Captain --
 DATA / (as Picard) Shhh. We're getting out of here.
 GEORDI / (whispers) Hurry. Data was just here; he went to get something.
 DATA / (as himself) Too late.
 DATA / (continuing) My Brother suggested that I try to develop my sense of humor. What do you think?
 GEORDI / I think it needs a little work.
 GEORDI / (continuing, reacts) What's happening?
 DATA / (as he does the right terminal) I am neutralizing your pain receptors.
 GEORDI / What are you going to do to me?
 DATA / I am implanting nano-cortical fibers in your cerebrum that are designed to learn and mimic your neural firing patterns.
 DATA / (continuing) Once they are in place, I will destroy your existing brain cells and see if the artificial neural network is able to take over cognitive functions.
 GEORDI / Data, listen to me. Lore is controlling you -- he's transmitting a carrier wave that's affecting your positronic matrix.
 DATA / If the procedure is successful, your cognitive processing functions will be considerably improved.
 GEORDI / Don't you care that he's manipulating you?
 DATA / However, there is approximately a sixty percent chance that you will not survive the procedure.
 GEORDI / I don't much care for those odds.
 DATA / They are cause for concern.
 DATA / (continuing) However, since I also have Counselor Troi and Captain Picard, the odds are that at least one of the procedures will be successful.
 TROI'S VOICE / Help me!
 TROI / (alarmed) He tried to escape -- the force-field put him into neural shock.
 TROI / (continuing) If he dies, Lore will blame you.
 PICARD / (continuing) See if the corridor's empty.
 DATA / Drop it or I will break his neck.
 DATA / (continuing) Take him.
 PICARD / (re: Geordi) What have you done to him?
 DATA / I will be back for him later.
 TROI / Geordi, are you in pain?
 GEORDI / No. I'm a little dizzy, but that's all.
 PICARD / I was able to take part of a transceiver from the guard's interlink system. It uses some kind of phased pulse technology. Is there any way we could modify it to generate a kedion pulse and reboot Data's program?
 GEORDI / It's a possibility. (beat) See if you can locate the phase modulation circuitry.
 TROI / I'll watch the door.
 PICARD / (finding it) All right, I've found it...
 GEORDI / Good... do you see anything that would act as a flux inhibitor?
 BEVERLY / We'll enter orbit here.
 BEVERLY / I hope that's enough time...
 BEVERLY / Hold on --
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Report.
 BEVERLY / (to com) Bridge to Transporter Rooms -- begin evacuation.
 BEVERLY / (to com) Crusher to Salazar. Report.
 BEVERLY / Keep trying.
 BEVERLY / (to herself) Come on, Chief. It's now or never.
 BEVERLY / Raise shields.
 BEVERLY / Helm, get us out of here.
 BEVERLY / Evasive maneuvers, full impulse.
 BEVERLY / Fire phasers.
 BEVERLY / Status of the warp engines?
 BEVERLY / (to con) Helm, set a new course -- heading three-four-four mark six. Full impulse.
 BEVERLY / (to Barnaby) The databanks should contain information about a process called metaphasic shielding --
 BEVERLY / How far along was he?
 BEVERLY / If we had metaphasic shielding, we could enter the sun's corona and the Borg ship wouldn't be able to follow. (beat) Can you bring the program on line?
 BEVERLY / Report.
 BEVERLY / Lieutenant, activate the metaphasic program. We don't have a choice.
 BEVERLY / Maintain course.
 BEVERLY / All stop.
 BEVERLY / The question is... how long can we survive in here?
 PICARD / I've done everything Geordi said. Now to activate it...
 TROI / How are we going to know whether the pulse reboots Data's ethical program?
 PICARD / We'll only be able to tell by his behavior.
 TROI / Won't he realize something has happened to him?
 PICARD / I doubt it. It's one program among thousands.
 PICARD / I just hope this force field has enough energy to trigger the pulse.
 GEORDI / You know, Data -- I've been thinking... about some of the times we've had together.
 GEORDI / Like that time we went sailing on Devala Lake. Remember that?
 DATA / I have a complete memory record of that day.
 GEORDI / You decided to take a swim... but when you jumped out of the boat you sank straight to the bottom.
 DATA / (matter of factly) I did not have enough buoyancy to get back to the surface.
 GEORDI / (still chuckling) So you had to walk over a kilometer along the bottom of the lake to get to shore.
 DATA / One kilometer, forty-six meters.
 GEORDI / It took two weeks to get the water out of your servos...
 DATA / I am ready to irradiate your existing brain cells.
 GEORDI / (quiet) Data... if you ever go back to being the way you were, you may not be able to forgive yourself for what you're about to do to me.
 DATA / I am getting some anomalous readings from your neural net. I will have to do further tests before I proceed.
 DATA / Someone will come and take you back to your cell.
 WORF / We can use the environmental control ducts to get inside the compound. They should take us to the detention area.
 RIKER / We'll have to move fast. If we have to stun a guard, the other Borg will know right away that he's been hurt.
 RIKER / We'll have to take that chance.
 DATA / It is too early to tell if the nano-cortical fibers have performed their function.
 DATA / (quiet) They came looking for me.
 DATA / I betrayed them. If they die... I am responsible.
 DATA / (firm) I do not want you to check my systems. I must resolve these issues myself.
 DATA / I... do not like it...
 DATA / Yes...
 DATA / Yes. Please... I want more...
 DATA / Thank you...
 BEVERLY / Can you stabilize it?
 BEVERLY / Do we have warp engines yet?
 BEVERLY / How do you know this'll work?
 BEVERLY / Let's do it.
 BEVERLY / Helm, take us back to the planet, full impulse.
 PICARD / (re: Geordi) You're killing him. He won't survive another session.
 DATA / I did not come for him -- I came for you.
 PICARD / ... It's not too late. If you remove the fibers, Geordi might recover.
 DATA / That will not be possible.
 PICARD / Why? Because Lore says so?
 DATA / (beat) It is for the greater good.
 PICARD / Good? Aren't good and bad, right and wrong, functions of your ethical program?
 DATA / That is correct.
 PICARD / What does that program tell you about what you're doing to Geordi, about what you and Lore are doing to the Borg?
 PICARD / (continuing) It tells you these things are wrong, doesn't it?
 PICARD / (continuing) How can actions that are wrong lead to a "greater good"?
 DATA / You are attempting to confuse me.
 PICARD / No, Data. You're not confused; you're sensing the truth. Your ethical program is fighting the negative emotions Lore is sending you.
 WORF / Where's the Captain?
 TROI / Data took him away.
 RIKER / There's not much time. (re: Geordi) Can he walk?
 TROI / He'll need help.
 RIKER / (to Troi) There's an air duct in the corridor that connects to a tunnel underneath the compound. You take Geordi and we'll look for the Captain.
 DATA / No... It would be wrong.
 DATA / Lore...
 DATA / What are you doing?
 DATA / I am going to deactivate you now.
 DATA / You leave me no other choice.
 DATA / Good bye, Lore.
 PICARD / What about Geordi and Troi?
 RIKER / The Enterprise is in orbit. They've been beamed aboard.
 DATA / Lore is no longer functioning. (beat) He must be disassembled so that he is never again a threat.
 PICARD / It's good to have you back, Data.
 DATA / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / What made you change your mind?
 PICARD / What will you do now?
 PICARD / I'm not sure that's true.
 PICARD / Good luck, Hugh.
 PICARD / Captain's Log, Stardate 47025.4. We have returned to Federation Space and are en route to Starbase two-nine-five. Mister La Forge remains under Doctor Crusher's care.
 DATA / Enter.
 GEORDI / Hi, Data.
 GEORDI / I just wanted to let you know that Doctor Crusher says I'll be able to return to duty soon.
 DATA / I am glad that the injuries I inflicted on you are not permanent.
 GEORDI / (notices slide) What's that?
 DATA / This is the chip my Father created for me so that I could experience emotions. I had it removed from Lore's body before he was dismantled.
 GEORDI / Does it still work?
 DATA / No. I am pleased to say that it was damaged when I was forced to fire on Lore.
 GEORDI / Pleased? Data, you've wanted emotions all your life.
 DATA / Yes. But emotions were responsible for what I did to you.
 DATA / I would never risk letting something like that happen again. My friendship with you is too important to me.
 GEORDI / I wouldn't be much of a friend to you if I let you give up on a life-long dream.
 GEORDI / Who knows? Maybe someday we can repair this.
 WORF / Enter.
 RIKER ENTERS, also in a dress uniform. He's surprised / to see that Worf is not ready.
 RIKER / Worf, they're going to be here any minute.
 WORF / I am having... problems.
 RIKER / If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were procrastinating.
 WORF / Klingons do not procrastinate.
 WORF / (continuing) It is a... tactical delay.
 RIKER / (tying sash) All you have to do is spend five minutes greeting the Iyaarans and another hour or so making small talk at the reception. I'm the one who has to spend the next three days escorting them around the ship.
 WORF / I do not enjoy these diplomatic situations.
 RIKER / It's all part of being in Starfleet. (ties sash) There.
 WORF / And I do not see why it is necessary to wear these ridiculous uniforms.
 RIKER / Protocol.
 WORF / They look like... dresses.
 RIKER / Worf, that is a remarkably outmoded and sexist attitude. I'm surprised at you.
 RIKER / (continuing) Besides, you look great in a dress.
 PICARD / Ambassador Loquel... Ambassador Byleth. I'm Captain Picard. Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
 PICARD / We are honored to be the site of the first cultural exchange between the Iyaaran people and the Federation.
 PICARD / Pleased to meet you.
 PICARD / (to Ambassadors) I'm looking forward to meeting with the Premier of Iyar.
 PICARD / (continuing) There will be a reception in your honor where you'll meet the rest of the Senior Staff. I'll be on my way to your home world, of course -- but I'm leaving you in the hands of my most experienced officers.
 PICARD / Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon Empire, is our head of security. He will be responsible for your safety while you're on board.
 PICARD / Counselor Deanna Troi from the Planet Betazed will be your personal liaison, Ambassador Loquel.
 TROI / Ambassador Loquel, it's an honor to meet you. May I show you to your quarters before we attend the reception?
 PICARD / And my First Officer, Commander William Riker from the planet Earth, will be assigned to you, Ambassador Byleth.
 PICARD / Commander Riker is a skilled diplomat, with wide experience in inter-species contact --
 PICARD / Well. That will be -- just fine. Mister Worf... ?
 WORF / Yes... Ambassador, I would be pleased to --
 The reception is in progress. Riker, Worf, Troi and DATA are there with several other Starfleet Officers. / (They are still in their dress uniforms.) A large BUFFET TABLE has been set-up -- it's topped with various FOOD and DRINKS.
 TROI / So first thing tomorrow, I thought I'd take you on a tour... show you the operational centers and the residential decks of the ship. Then after that, we could spend some time discussing some of the cultural underpinnings of your society --
 TROI / Excuse me?
 TROI / Oh... actually, I was waiting until we got to the dessert tray.
 TROI / It's something we eat after the main course. It's usually very sweet... usually very bad for you. We eat it purely for pleasure. (beat) If you ask me, it's the best part of any meal.
 TROI / (continuing) Let me introduce you to some of my favorites... (indicates desserts) Here we have peach cobbler with whipped cream. Tarvokian powder cake... (beat) But over here -- this is my very favorite.
 TROI / (continuing) This is a Ktarian Chocolate Puff. I'm not exactly sure what's in it... but I think there are at least seventeen varieties of chocolate inside.
 TROI / Delicious?
 TROI / Ambassador... I think we're going to get along very well.
 TROI / Shall we?
 WORF / I am sorry if you do not care for our --
 BEVERLY / Our custom in a situation like this is to serve ourselves. It's called a "buffet," and usually people prefer to choose --
 BEVERLY / Ambassador...
 WORF / It is all right, Doctor. I am happy to bring more food.
 DATA / (to Worf) How is your diplomatic assignment progressing so far?
 WORF / (terse) Fine.
 DATA / I have found that in moments of diplomatic tension, it is often helpful to find elements of commonality.
 WORF / Ambassador Byleth is... demanding... temperamental... rude...
 DATA / (innocently) You share all of those qualities in abundance. Perhaps you should build on your similarities.
 PICARD / So... I understand your homeworld has some of the most spectacular crystal formations in the sector.
 PICARD / (continuing) Is there any place in particular that you recommend I visit while I'm there?
 PICARD / Yes, well... what's our ETA?
 PICARD / I think I'll go update my itinerary...
 PICARD / What happened?
 PICARD / What's the cause?
 PICARD / There's an M-Class planet in this system. Can we reach it?
 PICARD / Inertial dampeners are off-line... life support is failing...
 PICARD / Voval...
 PICARD / (continuing) You may have a concussion... try not to move.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Enterprise... (beat) Picard to Enterprise... do you read me?
 PICARD / I can't get through... too much interference...
 PICARD / (off tricorder) There's a structure and some energy readings... about two kilometers south of here...
 PICARD / I'm going to try to find help. Do you understand?
 PICARD / Try to stay conscious. And don't leave the shuttle... there's some sort of plasma energy on the surface. (beat) I'll be back as soon as I can.
 WORF / (reacts) Late... it is oh-five hundred hours!
 WORF / I do not recall you saying anything about --
 WORF / No... I simply do not remember the conversation.
 TROI / This deck is devoted mainly to stellar cartography, biological research, and astrophysics...
 TROI / (continuing) We have over a thousand people on board, engaged in all facets of the ship's --
 TROI / No, thank you. I'm still recovering from all those desserts last night.
 TROI / I'm sure.
 TROI / Yum.
 TROI / (continuing) Next we're going to go to Deck Eight, which is interesting because it's not really finished. It's sort of a... multi-purpose deck...
 TROI / (continuing) Sometimes when we need an extra lab... another cabin, we --
 TROI / (continuing) Ambassador?
 TROI / That's a child.
 TROI / Children are our offspring. Our young. They grow into adults over a period of many years... they grow into beings like us.
 TROI / Ambassador, I'm curious... how does your species procreate?
 TROI / I see...
 TROI / That sounds like a wonderful idea.
 PICARD / Is someone there? Who's there... ?
 PICARD / What do you want? Who are you...
 WOMAN'S VOICE / Shhh...
 PICARD / Who... are you?
 PICARD / (continuing) Wait. Someone else was with me... the pilot of the shuttlecraft... he's wounded... please, he needs your help...
 PICARD / Hello...
 PICARD / (continuing, re: soup) This smells good. Thank you...
 PICARD / This is a Terellian cargo freighter, isn't it? Is this your ship? Were you one of the crew?
 PICARD / How many people survived? Are you the only one?
 PICARD / (continuing) Well, you're certainly not a Terellian... unless you've lost two of your arms...
 PICARD / (continuing) What's your name? (beat) I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer.
 PICARD / Anna... (beat) Anna, is there anyone else on this planet?
 PICARD / (continuing) How long have you been here?
 PICARD / Do you remember the date your ship crashed?
 PICARD / (reacts) That's seven years ago.
 PICARD / Anna... it's all right...
 PICARD / Anna, listen to me...
 PICARD / (continuing) On my shuttle, there's a lot of equipment that survived the crash. We can use it to contact Starfleet. They'll send a ship for us. We can leave.
 PICARD / Yes. Both of us. If you can get me back to the shuttle...
 PICARD / Don't worry... I won't move.
 PICARD / Let them knit... let the bones knit...
 PICARD / Anna... maybe you could go to the shuttle... bring the equipment back here...
 PICARD / Good. (beat) Go into the cockpit, and look for a small com panel in the center of the instrument bay. See if you can remove it, and bring it to me.
 PICARD / What is it?
 WORF / The Engineering sections encompass twelve decks of the secondary hull. Deck forty-two contains the antimatter storage facility. Deck thirty-six houses the --
 WORF / Excuse me?
 WORF / I am... not certain of the exact rate.
 GEORDI / Ah... well... why do you ask?
 WORF / This way.
 WORF / I am going to kill him! With my bare hands, I will take his neck and --
 RIKER / Worf.
 WORF / I have failed in my mission, Commander. I am clearly a bad diplomat. For the sake of the ship and the Federation... I request reassignment.
 RIKER / Denied.
 WORF / But Commander, these Iyaarans are irritating... arrogant... They cannot be reasoned with!
 TROI / Ambassador Loquel is quite pleasant.
 TROI / I will admit, he's a little... unusual.
 RIKER / What have you learned about him so far?
 TROI / He seems preoccupied with... recreation. In the past two days, I've spent more time in Ten Forward and the Holodeck than I have in the past two months. (beat) And he's obsessed with food. Especially chocolate.
 RIKER / You must be in heaven.
 TROI / To be honest... he's even testing my limits...
 WORF / (seizing on this) You see? They are insane!
 TROI / Worf... you've been patient with Ambassador Byleth, and that's good. But maybe it's time to let him know that some behavior is unacceptable to us. I think it's all right to suggest limits for the Ambassador...
 RIKER / Maybe we need to loosen things up a little bit... meet in a less official capacity.
 WORF / Like what?
 RIKER / Well... how about a friendly game of poker?
 PICARD / Anna... why is the door kept bolted from the outside?
 PICARD / From what?
 PICARD / If I can boost the output field, I might be able to send out a distress signal...
 PICARD / (continuing) There's something wrong with it...
 PICARD / The entire transmitter module's been destroyed...
 PICARD / How did this happen? It looks as though it's been hit by a phaser blast.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / We will get out of here, Anna. But it's not going to be easy... we need to work together...
 PICARD / Anna... no matter how long it takes, we will get out of here.
 PICARD / Trying to dislodge this power cell...
 PICARD / I've almost got it... (works) There.
 PICARD / (re: cell) Its energy relays are corroded... but it might be able to hold one more charge... (beat) If I can regenerate the cell... we may be able to reactivate the shuttlecraft's engines...
 PICARD / Sounds delightful...
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / If you'll hand me my tricorder, I think I can repair these energy relays.
 PICARD / Anna. I... care for you a great deal. I am grateful that you saved my life... you are a warm and compassionate person. I have a great deal of sympathy for what you've gone through... alone... here on this planet... (beat) But I don't think you're really in love with me.
 PICARD / I'm the first person you've seen in seven years. And I've brought you the hope of leaving this place... (beat) Isn't it possible that your feelings are a little... confused right now?
 PICARD / Look... sometimes when a person has gone through a traumatic experience, like yours... they come to look upon the person who rescues them as a sort of... larger than life figure. Sometimes they become infatuated with their rescuer. They may even think that... they're in love with that person...
 PICARD / That's not true. You're a very lovely woman. I just think this is... a little premature. We don't know anything about each other.
 PICARD / It's all right.
 PICARD / It'll take a couple of hours for the power cell to charge. After that, we'll have to take it to the shuttle immediately. The cell casing is already breaking down...
 PICARD / We're going to get out of here, Anna.
 RIKER / I'll bet ten.
 RIKER / Ambassador, the bet goes to you...
 TROI / That's twenty to me...
 WORF / I'm in. And I raise twenty.
 WORF / (to Byleth) Excuse me, Ambassador. Those are my chips.
 WORF / I saw you take two chips from my pile.
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / Perhaps I am losing because you've been cheating all along!
 RIKER / Wait a minute, let's just calm down...
 WORF / (outraged) You are an insulting, pompous fool! If you were not an Ambassador, I would disembowel you right here!
 RIKER / Lieutenant Worf -- stop! That's an order!
 WORF / What?
 PICARD / The power cell's ready. We need to get to the shuttle...
 PICARD / Why not?
 PICARD / We don't have a few hours. I told you, the cell's already degrading...
 PICARD / I'm feeling much better now. And I don't intend to use this any longer...
 PICARD / (firm) Anna.
 PICARD / There's no pain. It would seem that my ribs weren't broken after all...
 PICARD / (hard) What the hell's going on? Why are you trying to keep me here?
 PICARD / Why do you keep me locked inside this freighter? You say there are dangerous animals... but I've yet to see or hear a single one of them...
 PICARD / And what about that com panel? You said you damaged it while cutting it out of the shuttle... Did you? I find it hard to believe you would be that clumsy with the one piece of equipment that could save you after seven years.
 PICARD / (re: device) And what was this really for... to keep me immobilized?
 PICARD / So you found it necessary to hold me captive?
 PICARD / I'm going to go find that shuttle myself...
 PICARD / Anna...
 PICARD / Anna, no.
 PICARD / Stop it!
 PICARD / Anna, wait... where are you going?
 PICARD / Anna!
 PICARD looks to the wall opposite the door, following / the voice.
 PICARD / Over here! There's a door on the opposite side!
 PICARD / (continuing) Over here! The door's over here!
 PICARD / Voval...
 PICARD / (continuing) I thought you were dead...
 PICARD / Yes. There's a woman who lives here... she went to the shuttle... she told me you were dead...
 PICARD / I see...
 PICARD / Yes...
 PICARD / She was upset.
 PICARD / It's possible...
 PICARD / All right. You stay here -- warm yourself. I'll go look for her...
 PICARD / Anna!
 PICARD / Anna...
 PICARD / You don't have to do this. I found Voval, the shuttle pilot -- he's still alive. He can help us get away...
 PICARD / Anna --
 PICARD / No... no, I won't promise that. You've been manipulating me, haven't you?
 PICARD / Your necklace. I broke it. It was lying in the cargo freighter, by the fire... I left it there. (beat) Now it's whole again and back on your neck. How?
 PICARD / Where's Voval? Isn't it convenient that he arrived at the freighter only moments after you left... and then he insisted that I come looking for you. He took me here to the ledge... where I found you... on the cliff, about to jump. Very well-timed, wouldn't you say?
 PICARD / Are you working together? Voval's the only one who could've gotten the necklace and given it to you...
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 PICARD / (continuing) What are you waiting for? It's a long fall... at least two hundred meters. You should die instantly... if that's what you really want.
 PICARD / (continuing) But somehow, I don't think it is.
 PICARD / Failed. Voval... what was the purpose of all this?
 PICARD / Ambassador...
 PICARD / You staged the crash... faked my injury... and arranged all this to see if I would fall in love with you?
 PICARD / What gave you the idea that trapping me here would give you the opportunity to explore love?
 PICARD / (realizing) And that man was injured... the woman nursed him back to health... they fell in love...
 PICARD / Well... let's just say that we're not used to such a... direct approach. (beat) Ambassador Voval... I must tell you that in our culture, what you've done would be considered dangerously close to a crime.
 PICARD / We can... talk about that later.
 PICARD / (continuing) The first order of business would seem to be getting off this planet. Am I to assume the shuttle is not as badly damaged as it looked?
 PICARD / Then let's go...
 RIKER / (to Worf) You seem a little sore...
 RIKER / (reacts) Eleven hours...
 WORF / It was... excruciating.
 TROI / After the past few days... I could use something a little bland.
 PICARD / For me as well, Ambassador.
 PICARD / On the contrary. I found your approach... intriguing. (off his look) We humans tend to take a rather... balanced approach to life. Never too much, never too little. It's nice to find a culture that's willing to take an experience to its furthest extremes.
 GEORDI is rushing up a ladder in the tube. The RED / ALERT CLAXON is sounding around him -- this is clearly an emergency. He is wearing his Starfleet uniform, but not his VISOR; his eyes are not clouded and his temple inputs aren't in place.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (concerned) Geordi... Have you found it yet?
 GEORDI / Not yet...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Starting to get fumes... Ammonia, fluorine, potassium cyanide...
 GEORDI / (continuing) I can feel the heat from here.
 GEORDI / (continuing) There it is!
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / How far?
 GEORDI / About ten meters. Along the ODN line. It's hot -- over two thousand degrees. (beat) I'm going in.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Geordi, wait.
 GEORDI / We're okay... I've activated the emergency supression system.
 GEORDI / (continuing) It's under control.
 DATA is monitoring the interface unit on Geordi's body; / BEVERLY is studying the console; RIKER is standing by, / watching Geordi.
 BEVERLY / (off console) All his vital functions are completely normal.
 DATA / The interface unit is operating within expected parameters.
 RIKER / Why did he start coughing when he went through the gasses?
 BEVERLY / (shrugs) Psychosomatic response.
 GEORDI / I feel like I'm actually here... I mean there -- in the Jefferies tube. I saw the smoke and I couldn't help coughing.
 DATA / No one else has reported so complete a sensory experience.
 BEVERLY / The interface is perfect for Geordi because his VISOR inputs allow the probe to transmit information directly into his cerebral cortex.
 RIKER / It looks like this is going to work. Let's get the probe out of the Jefferies tube and into the launch bay before we reach Marijne Seven.
 GEORDI / Will do...
 GEORDI / Something's wrong. I'm having trouble controlling my left leg.
 RIKER / (to Beverly) What is it?
 BEVERLY / The probe is designed to respond to the movements Geordi intends to make -- when his brain sends a message to move his leg, the interface moves the probe instead.
 DATA / Apparently the gain on the tactile sensors is too low; I will increase the input.
 GEORDI / There it goes.
 GEORDI / I'm on my way down.
 RIKER / Why the body-suit?
 DATA / It provides tactile sensations so that Geordi will feel as if he is in the same environment as the probe.
 BEVERLY / What's wrong?
 GEORDI / Nothing...
 GEORDI / (continuing) I just saw my reflection in a panel. (wry) I forgot what a handsome guy I am.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47215.5. We are responding to a distress call from the science vessel Raman, which is apparently trapped inside the turbulent atmosphere of an unusual gas giant planet. We will use an experimental interface probe in our attempt to rescue it.
 PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room and heads for the aft / science station where Riker, Data and Geordi are working.
 DATA / I have reviewed the vessel's mission plans. The Raman was to descend to the lower atmosphere, eleven thousand kilometers below its current position...
 DATA / (continuing) The crew was to sample the atmosphere at that level, and then return to a safer orbit.
 GEORDI / Something must have happened down there. Maybe the shields failed, or they had an inversion reaction in the nacelles.
 PICARD / Any life signs?
 GEORDI / Our bio-sensors are useless -- there's too much interference in the atmosphere.
 RIKER / The crew might still be alive. But we'll never be able to tell from up here.
 PICARD / Will the probe be able to transmit through the interference?
 DATA / The probe sends information via a focused particle beam that should be able to cut through the interference.
 GEORDI / But we may have to operate the interface at near tolerance levels.
 PICARD / Will your nervous system be able to handle that much sensory input?
 GEORDI / (nods) We've tested the interface at up to seventy percent of tolerance.
 RIKER / There shouldn't be a problem going higher -- the safety override will kick in at ninety-eight percent tolerance and disengage the interface.
 WORF / Captain, I am receiving a transmission from Starfleet Command -- Admiral Holt.
 PICARD / In my Ready Room.
 PICARD / (continuing) The seven people on that ship are our first priority. Is the probe ready for launch?
 DATA / Yes, Sir.
 PICARD / Send it directly to the aft section of the Raman, through the secondary air lock. That'll put it one bulkhead away from the Bridge.
 GEORDI / I'll interface with the probe as soon as it's in place and take it in the rest of the way.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 PICARD / Onscreen.
 PICARD / (continuing) Hello, Marcus.
 PICARD / How's life on DS-Three?
 PICARD / Nothing unusual about that.
 PICARD / The Hera?
 PICARD / I'll tell Commander La Forge...
 PICARD / Mister Data, I need a word with Commander La Forge.
 DATA / Yes, Sir. (to Geordi) I will be on the Bridge.
 PICARD / I've just spoken to Starfleet. (gently) The Hera is missing.
 GEORDI / Missing... ?
 GEORDI / What about my mother... ?
 PICARD / Captain La Forge has disappeared along with the rest of her crew...
 GEORDI / (quietly to himself) Your only son, Mom...
 GEORDI / Come in...
 RIKER / I didn't mean to interrupt.
 GEORDI / Don't worry about it.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Mom's always trying to find me a wife.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) This came in about three weeks ago. (beat) I never got back to her...
 RIKER / (gently) Geordi, the probe has entered the planet's atmosphere. I'm ready to move it inside the ship. (beat) If you want to take a couple of days off, I'll run the interface.
 GEORDI / The interface is calibrated specifically for my VISOR inputs. You'd need at least ten hours to convert it. Those crewmen down there can't wait...
 RIKER / The interface doesn't have to be fully compatible. I could use it right now. I wouldn't have the control you'd have, but it would still work.
 GEORDI / Forget it. I'm the best one for the job, and there's no reason not to go ahead as planned.
 RIKER / (gently) The Hera is reason enough.
 GEORDI / The Hera is missing. That's all. Until I hear something more, my mother might just as well have taken the crew on an unscheduled holiday.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Let's go.
 RIKER / Sir, the probe is through the airlock and in position aboard the Raman.
 PICARD / Picard to Commander Data. Report.
 DATA / (to Com) We are ready to bring the interface on line.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Proceed.
 DATA / Activating the remote sensors...
 DATA / (continuing) Initiating interface... now.
 BEVERLY / (off monitor) Vital signs normal... How do you feel, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Fine...
 DATA / Do you have visual contact?
 GEORDI / Not yet...
 GEORDI'S VOICE / Increase the input signal, Data. I'm not seeing anything...
 DATA / Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / I can see. But no colors.
 DATA / Increasing signal strength of seventy-five percent of tolerance.
 GEORDI / That's better.
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Your pulse has gone up...
 BEVERLY / It might take your nervous system a little while to get used to this input level.
 GEORDI / I'm excited, that's all. This is like being on a roller coaster.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Or a first date... Everything's okay.
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / (lightly) I'll be the judge of that, Geordi. If your heart rate goes too high, we'll disconnect you.
 GEORDI / Understood. But don't pull the plug yet...
 GEORDI / (continuing) It's a mess in here. There must be a hull breach somewhere. I'm picking up atmospheric gasses inside the corridor -- methane and ammonia primarily.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm heading toward the Bridge.
 GEORDI / (continuing) It's getting worse the closer I get. The break in the hull might be on the Bridge itself.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I found somebody!
 DATA'S VOICE / What is your position?
 GEORDI / About twelve meters up the main corridor! A section of the bulkhead collapsed on top of him.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I can't move it. I need more power to the tractor beams.
 BEVERLY / Go to eighty percent of tolerance -- no higher.
 GEORDI / He looks pretty bad.
 GEORDI / (continuing) He's dead.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Data, the door halfway down the left corridor... what's it lead to?
 DATA'S VOICE / A magnetic storage bay.
 GEORDI / (nods) If there was a breach on the Bridge, that would be the safest place to go.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Data, I need a phaser burst. Wide focus, level four intensity.
 GEORDI / I've found them!
 GEORDI / (continuing) They're dead... all of them.
 GEORDI / (continuing) There's a fire in here...
 BEVERLY / Data! Disconnect him!
 BEVERLY / (continuing) What happened?
 GEORDI / (dazed) I don't know... My hands...
 BEVERLY / (stunned) They're burned...
 PICARD / How did this happen?
 BEVERLY / There was some kind of energy discharge in the interface suit.
 PICARD / Shouldn't the safety over-rides have prevented that?
 BEVERLY / Yes... but I have a theory why they didn't.
 BEVERLY / The tolerance levels on the interface were set extremely high. I think Geordi's neural response to the input was so strong that it created a feedback loop.
 GEORDI / The sensors that were transmitting the sensation of heat to my hands must've overloaded.
 BEVERLY / I know it seems hard to believe, but the probe was sending huge amounts of sensory data directly into Geordi's brain. The tolerance levels on the interface were set extremely high.
 PICARD / The Raman's crew is dead. I'd like to retrieve their vessel, but not if it means risking Geordi's safety.
 GEORDI / If we turn down the sensory input from the probe, I should be fine.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Seven people lost their lives down there... we should at least retrieve the data they were collecting. Otherwise their deaths won't have any meaning.
 PICARD / Doctor?
 BEVERLY / If we operate the interface at lower input levels, I'd say the risk is acceptable.
 PICARD / Alright. (touches combadge) Picard to Riker.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker, here.
 PICARD / The Raman's crew is dead. I'd like to retrieve their vessel, but not if it means risking Geordi's safety.
 GEORDI / If we turn down the sensory input from the probe, I should be fine.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Seven people lost their lives down there... we should at least retrieve the data they were collecting.
 PICARD / Doctor?
 BEVERLY / If we operate the interface at lower input levels, I'd say the risk is acceptable.
 PICARD / Alright. (touches combadge) Picard to Riker.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker, here.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / I've decided to proceed with the probe.
 RIKER / (to COM) We'll have to take it into the Raman's auxiliary control room -- the Bridge is too badly damaged.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / How long before you can get it into position?
 RIKER / A few hours -- we're going to have to cut through a bulkhead.
 PICARD / Acknowledged.
 BEVERLY / (to Geordi) Looks like you'll have some time to recuperate.
 GEORDI / There's something I need to do anyway.
 GEORDI / How are you, Dad?
 GEORDI / Yeah...
 GEORDI / -- Dad. Don't you think everybody's jumping the gun here? (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / Last I heard, two starships were still out there looking. They've found no debris, no residual warp distortion --
 GEORDI / Not yet. That doesn't mean they won't.
 GEORDI / You can think that if you want. But until I see some hard evidence, I'm not going to give up hope.
 DATA / Come in.
 GEORDI / Hey, Data. Still working?
 DATA / No. I have completed the adjustments on the interface. I am now waiting for Commander Riker to finish moving the probe.
 DATA / (continuing) Do you wish to be comforted?
 GEORDI / No... I was just passing by. Wondered what you were up to.
 DATA / (re: monitor) I am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry.
 GEORDI / Data, there's nothing on the screen.
 DATA / That is not entirely correct. While it is true the display is currently blank, this emptiness has a poetic meaning. So it cannot be considered "nothing" as such.
 GEORDI / Says who?
 DATA / The ancient Doosodarians. Much of their poetry contained such "lacunae" or empty spaces. Often these pauses measured several days in length, during which poet and audience were encouraged to fully acknowledge the emptiness of the experience.
 GEORDI / I remember some lectures at Starfleet academy that seemed like that.
 DATA / Are you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother?
 GEORDI / Why do you ask that?
 DATA / You are no doubt feeling emotional distress as a result of her disappearance. Though you claimed to be "just passing by," that is most likely an excuse to start a conversation about this uncomfortable subject. Am I correct?
 GEORDI / Well, no. Sometimes "just passing by" means "just passing by."
 DATA / Then I apologize for my premature assumption.
 DATA / (continuing) This particular poem has a lacuna of forty-seven minutes. You may experience the emptiness with me if you wish.
 GEORDI / (unsure) Thanks...
 GEORDI / Data, maybe you gave up too fast.
 DATA / I do not understand.
 GEORDI / When I said "just passing by" means "just passing by" -- I didn't really mean it.
 DATA / My initial assumption was correct. You do wish to speak of your mother.
 GEORDI / Am I crazy to think she's still alive?
 DATA / Your sanity is not in question. However, your evaluation of the available information is... biased.
 GEORDI / She's the captain of a starship! She's gotten herself into and out of impossible situations before. Why should this be any different?
 DATA / Disappearances fitting the profile of the Hera have rarely ended with the safe recovery of ship and crew.
 GEORDI / (sharp) That makes me feel better.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm sorry, Data. I didn't mean to snap at you.
 DATA / I am not offended. You are upset and your reactions are not surprising.
 GEORDI / I guess I am a little... on edge.
 GEORDI / (continuing) It's just that... If she really is dead... (quietly) I don't know what I'm going to do...
 BEVERLY / (to Geordi) We're receiving the probe's telemetry.
 DATA / The input levels are currently at fifty-three percent of tolerance.
 GEORDI / That's too low, Data. I won't be able to do anything down there.
 BEVERLY / I want to start with as wide a margin of safety as possible. We can adjust upward as needed. (beat) Ready?
 GEORDI / Go ahead.
 DATA / Initiating interface...
 GEORDI'S VOICE / I can't see anything.
 DATA'S VOICE / I am increasing input now...
 GEORDI / That's better... but I need more...
 DATA'S VOICE / Is this level sufficient?
 DATA'S VOICE / (continuing) Geordi?
 DATA'S VOICE / (continuing) Geordi, can you hear me?
 GEORDI / (barely) Mom...
 GEORDI / Mom, is it you?
 GEORDI / I forgot! All you're seeing is a probe. Yes, it's me. I'm on the Enterprise. I'm interfaced with this probe.
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Geordi. Who are you talking to? (beat) What are you seeing?
 GEORDI / But is it really you?
 GEORDI / How can it be... ? How is it possible --
 GEORDI / Down where?
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Geordi. Report.
 GEORDI / (to Beverly) Hang on, Doctor...
 GEORDI / Why? Why do we have to go to the surface?
 GEORDI / "We?" Your ship? The Hera is down there?
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Geordi, we're disconnecting you right now...
 GEORDI / (to Beverly) No. Wait...
 DATA / (to Beverly) The cut-off has been automatically activated.
 BEVERLY / He's in neural shock --
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) The sensory overload didn't cause any permanent damage -- but I wouldn't want to expose his nervous system to that much stimulus again.
 PICARD / Is there any indication of what caused the hallucination?
 BEVERLY / His brain functions are normal --
 GEORDI / I told you, I wasn't hallucinating.
 DATA / Geordi, I have analyzed the probe's sensor logs -- there are no readings that would indicate the presence of a living human on board the Raman.
 GEORDI / She wasn't actually there. Her ship is on the surface.
 PICARD / Then you believe you saw some kind of... transmission?
 GEORDI / (nodding) Somehow she managed to contact me.
 DATA / We have no indication of a transmission of any kind.
 GEORDI / Maybe I'm the only one who could detect it -- because I was interfaced with the probe.
 DATA / The probe does allow Geordi to sense quantum fluctuations, subspace anomalies, and other phenomena not perceptible to other kinds of sensors.
 PICARD / Granted. But why would he perceive his mother visually, as if she were standing in the room?
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure... I do know that our brains aren't designed to process the kind of sensory information Geordi was getting. When the brain receives something it can't understand, it interprets the input as best it can -- sometimes as a sound or smell, sometimes visually.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) You see?
 BEVERLY / Geordi, that doesn't mean you're mother was really communicating with you. I'm just trying to explain why you might've thought she was.
 GEORDI / I'm telling you, my mother's ship is trapped down there -- they need our help.
 PICARD / (gently) The Hera's last reported location was over three hundred light years away. How could it have ended up here?
 DATA / If the Hera is on the surface, its hull could not possibly withstand the pressure of the atmosphere.
 GEORDI / Just let me go back so we can be sure.
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) I don't recommend he use the interface again -- the sensory overload nearly killed him.
 GEORDI / I'll be all right.
 PICARD / I'm sorry, Geordi. But I won't risk your life.
 PICARD / Mister Data, find another way to salvage the Raman. I want to hear an alternate plan in two hours.
 DATA / Yes, Captain.
 PICARD / (gently) In the meantime, I'd like you to talk with Counselor Troi. She's expecting you.
 GEORDI / Aye, Sir...
 TROI / What's your mother like, Geordi?
 GEORDI / Counselor, if you think I'm going to start talking about my childhood, you're way off.
 TROI / That's not what I asked.
 GEORDI / No, I guess not. (beat) She was -- (catching himself) She is... brilliant, funny... really perceptive. She knows people. Knows what they're all about even before they open their mouths. She's always been like that. A good judge of character.
 TROI / When did you see her last?
 GEORDI / Seven months ago, when she first took command of the Hera. I went to a party she had for her crew...
 GEORDI / (continuing) The Enterprise and the Hera were in the same sector three weeks ago. She wanted to see me. We were both pretty busy though... (quietly) I guess I could have made the time. But I didn't think... I mean I just didn't think...
 TROI / (gently) You didn't think it would be your last chance to see her...
 GEORDI / You don't know that! None of us does!
 TROI / I'm going to suggest something. Call it a theory. Alright?
 GEORDI / (calms down) Alright...
 TROI / You're very worried about the disappearance of your mother... and guilty over not seeing her when you had the chance. So you're unwilling even to consider that she might be dead. This need to believe she's alive is so strong, it manifested itself as a physical image.
 GEORDI / But she told me she's trapped on the planet! She's in danger! If this was some kind of wish fulfillment, don't you think I'd fantasize her being safe and sound?
 TROI / No. Because that would end the fantasy -- you'd know it wasn't true. The more involved and complicated and unending your story is, the longer you can believe your mother is still alive.
 GEORDI / That's your theory, Counselor. I've got a different one.
 DATA / I have been exploring the possibility of using a tractor beam to pull the Raman from the atmosphere. However, there is so much interference that it prevents a positive lock.
 RIKER / If we could set up some sort of relay system...
 DATA / That is my conclusion as well, Commander. Two shuttlecraft, staggered between the Enterprise and the Raman, with their shields adjusted to refocus the tractor beam.
 PICARD / Can we get those shuttles close enough without putting them in danger? (to Geordi) Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / (shrugs) I suppose so. (beat) Yes. As long as you keep them above the troposphere, they'll be alright.
 PICARD / In that case --
 GEORDI / (interrupting) What about the Hera?
 GEORDI / (continuing) We'll be leaving my mother and her crew stranded on the planet. We have to save them.
 PICARD / Commander --
 GEORDI / (interrupting) -- I've been thinking about this...
 GEORDI / (continuing) A few weeks ago I got a message from my mother. She said she had a new chief engineer who was always experimenting with the warp drive. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / Well, I've seen the Hera -- it uses trionic initiators in the warp coil. They have a history of strange side effects -- especially if you start playing around with them.
 DATA / There have been reports of warp bubbles and other subspace deformations.
 GEORDI / (nodding) So what if that's what happened? Not a warp bubble, but a subspace funnel.
 DATA / Connecting two points through subspace.
 GEORDI / (nods) The Hera could have accidentally created a distortion that emptied out right here, on Marijne Seven.
 PICARD / Why here?
 GEORDI / The Hera passed near this planet just ten days ago. There's a lot of subspace distortion in the atmosphere -- the ship might've picked up some residual traces that directed the funnel back here.
 RIKER / (disbelieving) And the Hera is still in one piece, down on the surface?
 GEORDI / Maybe it's surrounded by some kind of subspace field that's keeping it together. But who knows for how long?
 PICARD / Do you have any evidence to support this... hypothesis?
 GEORDI / I did get some strange subspace readings when I was interfaced with the probe.
 RIKER / Geordi, that could be anything.
 GEORDI / I talked to her. She asked me to take the Raman closer to the planet.
 PICARD / Is any of this possible?
 DATA / Yes.
 GEORDI / There.
 DATA / However, I believe it is... (hesitates) unlikely.
 PICARD / How unlikely?
 DATA / Nearly impossible, Sir.
 PICARD / Proceed with the shuttle plan.
 GEORDI / Captain --
 PICARD / -- Mister La Forge. Stay here for a moment.
 PICARD / (continuing) Geordi, I'm not unsympathetic about what you're going through. But I want you to consider my position as well.
 GEORDI / Yes, Sir.
 PICARD / Your mother's disappearance... It's... a tragic thing... (beat) But I can't risk your safety on the basis of a dubious hypothesis.
 GEORDI / If there's even one chance in a million I'm right and she's alive...
 PICARD / I'm sorry, Geordi. I've made my decision.
 GEORDI / I understand, Sir.
 DATA / I suspected you would decide to operate the interface alone.
 GEORDI / (surprised) You did?
 DATA / I am familiar enough with your behavior patterns to predict certain... decisions.
 GEORDI / I guess you know me pretty well...
 DATA / You are disobeying the Captain.
 GEORDI / I can't just sit back and do nothing when my mother might be down on that planet.
 DATA / I can not allow you to endanger your well being.
 GEORDI / If we leave here without knowing for sure...
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'll have to live with it for the rest of my life... wondering... if I left her to die... I couldn't take that, Data... I couldn't...
 GEORDI / That's why I have to do this.
 DATA / I could have you confined to quarters for the duration of the mission.
 GEORDI / If you want to do that to me, Data, then go ahead. Because nothing less is going to stop me from trying to save my mother.
 GEORDI / What are you doing?
 DATA / I will monitor the interface and attempt to keep you safe.
 DATA / I can not have you confined to quarters for something you have not yet done.
 GEORDI / Data, we could both end up in a lot of trouble for this.
 DATA / There is a high degree of probability that you are right.
 GEORDI / Thanks, Data.
 Geordi removes the VISOR and pulls the interface unit over his head. DATA / However, I have a request.
 GEORDI / (surprised) What's that?
 DATA / I would ask you to consider the possibility that what you see is not real.
 GEORDI / (nods) I will. I promise.
 DATA / I am establishing the interface...
 GEORDI / Mom... ?
 GEORDI / How did you get here?
 GEORDI / That's just what I thought!
 GEORDI / How are we communicating?
 DATA'S VOICE / Geordi, are you seeing the image of your mother... ?
 GEORDI / Yes, and she just confirmed everything I've been saying.
 DATA / I am reading some unusual subspace energy in your vicinity -- similar to what the probe sensors recorded the first time you encountered your mother.
 GEORDI / That's how she's communicating with me. It's the only kind of signal they could send that would get through the interference.
 GEORDI / I've been thinking about this -- I'm going to take the Raman into a low stationary orbit and initiate an inverse warp cascade.
 GEORDI / The subspace distortion from the cascade should reverse the warp funnel -- your ship will end up right where it started.
 DATA / Geordi, the atmosphere becomes increasingly turbulent the farther down you go -- you may not be able to bring the Raman close enough to the Hera before being destroyed.
 GEORDI / I have to try, Data.
 GEORDI / (nods) Shields back on line... we're starting our descent...
 GEORDI / (continuing; quietly) Thank god...
 GEORDI / That you're alive -- that I was right about all this. (beat) I can't wait to call Dad. He and Ariana had given up...
 GEORDI'S VOICE / Eventually, yeah.
 GEORDI'S VOICE / (continuing) Data -- everything's fading in and out.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm losing the interface.
 DATA / The probe is descending out of range.
 GEORDI / You're going to have to turn up the input gain to maintain my connection.
 DATA / (hesitates) It is already at seventy-five percent of tolerance.
 GEORDI / You can take it all the way up to a hundred if you increase it slowly enough -- give my nervous system time to adapt.
 DATA / That is theoretically true. But even at this input level you have already experienced dangerous neural feedback.
 GEORDI / Data, there are over three hundred people on board the Hera. We're the only chance they've got.
 DATA / I will increase the gain incrementally as you descend.
 GEORDI / It's working.
 DATA / When we are ready to disconnect the interface, we must allow sufficient time to lower the input levels -- otherwise your nervous system would go into shock from the sudden drop in input.
 GEORDI / Once I initiate the warp cascade we can start dropping the gain.
 GEORDI / (continuing) We'll be in sensor range of your ship within a few minutes.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm sorry I didn't get over to see you a few weeks ago.
 GEORDI / I'm sorry; it won't happen again.
 WORF / (off console) Captain, the Raman is descending toward the planet.
 RIKER / Geordi...
 DATA / Geordi, we are now at ninety percent of tolerance.
 DATA / (continuing) My calculations show that you will reach one hundred percent of tolerance before you are in range of the Hera.
 GEORDI / Then we're going to have to go beyond tolerance.
 DATA / That is not advisable. You must cease your descent.
 GEORDI / Data, I'm taking this ship down. If you don't boost the gain past tolerance levels, I'll lose the interface when we go out of range and my nervous system will go into shock.
 DATA / You are putting me in a very difficult position. Please cease your descent.
 GEORDI / I won't do it... so you'd better increase the tolerance...
 DATA / Disengaging safety systems... going to full tolerance levels... now.
 GEORDI / Thanks, Data.
 GEORDI / (to his mother) We're getting close...
 PICARD'S VOICE / La Forge.
 GEORDI / Yes, Captain?
 PICARD / Stop your descent and prepare to disengage the interface.
 GEORDI / I'm sorry, sir. But I can't do that.
 PICARD / Damn it, Geordi -- you're going to kill yourself...
 GEORDI / If I come back now, my mother and her entire crew will die. (reads monitor; to Silva) I'm scanning for your ship... (puzzled) I'm not getting anything.
 GEORDI / Not really. I should be picking something up by now.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm not finding anything... No warp funnel... No ship... There's nothing there.
 BEVERLY / (off monitor) His neural synapses are overloading. (to Picard) He can't survive this...
 PICARD / Geordi -- what's happening to you?
 PICARD'S VOICE / Geordi!
 GEORDI / (barely) Reverse tractors -- Reverse --
 DATA'S VOICE / Reversing tractor beams...
 GEORDI / What are you?
 PICARD / Geordi... Report.
 GEORDI / You're trapped... ?
 PICARD / Is there any way we can disconnect him?
 BEVERLY / If we cut him off abruptly, he'll go into neural shock.
 PICARD / How can we lower the input gradually and still get him out before it's too late?
 DATA / Perhaps we can deceive his neural receptors.
 PICARD / Deceive them?
 DATA / By feeding them the sensory information recorded from his earlier experiences with the probe.
 BEVERLY / (catching on) We could disconnect the interface and still maintain the input levels.
 DATA / We could then lower them in a controlled manner.
 PICARD / Like a decompression tank. (off their nods) Let's try it.
 GEORDI / Captain. I have to take the ship into the lower atmosphere...
 PICARD'S VOICE / Explain.
 GEORDI / As I understand it... when the Raman got close to the planet, they accidentally picked up some lifeforms that live in the lower atmosphere. Subspace beings of some kind -- intelligent. When the ship went back into a higher orbit, the beings were trapped.
 PICARD'S VOICE / How do you know all this?
 GEORDI / One of them is able to communicate with me. It must have read my thoughts through the probe interface and took the form of my Mother -- to try to talk me into taking the ship closer to the surface.
 PICARD'S VOICE / Were these beings responsible for the death of the Raman's crew?
 GEORDI / Yes, but I don't think it was on purpose. They probably tried to communicate with them the same way they're communicating with me -- by directly accessing their thoughts. That must've been fatal to the crew... I guess the interface protected me.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I have to take them back -- they can't survive so far up in the atmosphere.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'll turn the ship around and come back as soon as we're --
 PICARD'S VOICE / La Forge! What happened?
 GEORDI / The atmosphere is getting more turbulent. It's overloading the systems.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm having trouble keeping the shields up.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm losing power...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Total shield failure in eight seconds...
 PICARD / Are you ready to switch inputs?
 BEVERLY / Almost.
 GEORDI / Shields are failing...
 BEVERLY / Switching inputs!
 PICARD / Is it working?
 BEVERLY / His vital signs are stabilizing. He's going to make it.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. We have succeeded in disengaging Mister La Forge from the interface and are en route to Starbase four-nine-five.
 PICARD / You disobeyed my direct order, and you put yourself in grave danger. (beat) I'm not happy.
 GEORDI / It's my fault, sir. Data was just --
 PICARD / (interrupting) I'll deal with Data at another time. Meanwhile, I'll have to write this incident into your permanent record.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Geordi...
 PICARD / (continuing) I'm very sorry you didn't find your mother.
 GEORDI / Thank you, sir. (beat) When I was down there... it was so real. It's funny, but in a way... I feel like I got a chance to say goodbye...
 GEORDI'S DIALOGUE - PAGE 55, SCENE 72 / 
 GEORDI / You're trapped?
 GEORDI / (continuing) Caught on the ship...
 GEORDI / (continuing) You killed the Raman's crew?
 GEORDI / (continuing) What do you want?
 TROI / We had some business dealings... he owes me money.
 TROI / Maybe we should discuss that possibility. But first, I have to find him... collect the money I'm owed...
 TROI / (maybe) Mmmmmm...
 TROI / Maybe I like danger.
 TROI / If I can't find him, I'll have to move on. Are you sure you haven't seen him?
 TROI / You're lying...
 RIKER / Great story... I'll have to remember that the next time I'm in a knife fight...
 RIKER / (continuing) Any luck?
 WORF / I think the one over there knows something.
 WORF / He wouldn't admit to having seen the Captain... but he said that anyone who visited the ruins of Nafir would probably come here eventually... I suspect he knows more.
 RIKER / Let's go.
 WORF / (loud whisper) Commander -- I told him --
 RIKER / My friend here tells me you might know about the man we're looking for.
 WORF / (covering for Riker) I explained to him... that we are looking for the man who impregnated your sister.
 RIKER / You can imagine how much this means to me.
 RIKER / I see. And just how much would "anything" be?
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / I'm sorry... but I think he wants to stay.
 BEVERLY / (to Yranac) Sit down.
 RIKER / This -- (gestures to Beverly) -- is my sister. (beat) She's angry. (beat) She has a vicious temper. I wouldn't cross her.
 WORF / And how much more latinum will it take to offset that risk?
 RIKER / Yes...
 RIKER / Agreed. Now talk.
 WORF / Who were these aliens?
 BEVERLY / I'm picking up some Starfleet fiber traces... and human cellular debris.
 RIKER / Can you establish a DNA sequence?
 BEVERLY / There's something strange here. The cell structures are badly distorted. It looks as if they've been exposed to some kind of high energy field.
 WORF / A weapon discharge?
 BEVERLY / It could be. There are faint traces of micro-crystalline damage in the floor material. But I'm not familiar with the pattern.
 RIKER / You didn't say anything about a weapon.
 TROI / He's telling the truth.
 RIKER / Doctor?
 BEVERLY / There's no question. It's Captain Picard's DNA.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I used a multi-base progression to regenerate the DNA. The technique is practically flawless...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) The cellular damage could have been caused by a variety of energy fields... it's hard to be specific. I can't tell whether it was the field itself that killed him or if he was already dead when...
 RIKER / I'll need your analysis for my report to Starfleet.
 BEVERLY / It's all here.
 RIKER / Thank you. (beat) I'll inform the crew.
 RIKER / Come.
 TROI / How are you doing?
 RIKER / I'm all right.
 TROI / The crew is pretty shaken up... I'm arranging a memorial service... I think you should be the one to deliver the eulogy.
 RIKER / You'd be better at something like that. Or Beverly. She knew him the longest...
 TROI / I know it won't be easy... but it's important for all of us to face what's happened. You're in command now. The crew will be looking to you for guidance --
 RIKER / You don't understand. I can't give the eulogy because I won't be at the service.
 TROI / A memorial service helps to give everyone a sense of completion. Helps them begin the healing process...
 RIKER / That's exactly the point. I don't want to heal.
 TROI / Wil --
 RIKER / I've got an open wound in here, it hurts like hell, and I don't want it to get better. I don't want to believe that everything's all right.
 TROI / You're angry...
 RIKER / You're damn right. And I intend to stay angry -- until I find whoever's responsible for the Captain's death.
 TROI / That's pretty selfish, Wil. (a beat as Riker is taken aback) Do you think you're the only one in pain? That you have a monopoly on loss? Well, I've got news for you. We're all hurting... we're all angry. And like it or not, you've got a responsibility to the crew. You can't just indulge your personal desire for revenge.
 RIKER / (harshly) That's enough, Counselor.
 RIKER / (continuing, softer) I'm sorry. (beat) Deanna. This isn't about revenge. It's about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight... for nothing. Somebody has to answer for that. (beat) Then I can mourn.
 WORF / Commander. We are receiving a transmission from Admiral Chekote at Starbase two-twenty-seven.
 RIKER / Put it through to the Ready Room.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Sir.
 RIKER / I have a request, sir. (beat) I'd like to conduct an investigation into Captain Picard's death.
 RIKER / I know that, sir. But frankly, I don't have much confidence in the authorities on Dessica Two. There's every reason to believe they're corrupt.
 RIKER / Sir, the Captain's death has hit me pretty hard. I may not be completely objective... but no one is more determined than I am. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / I won't quit until we find out who's responsible.
 RIKER / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / These are the best quarters we have.
 RIKER / (continuing) Now that you've had some time to relax, I was hoping you might have remembered some details about the aliens you saw... something you'd forgotten earlier.
 RIKER / You said the aliens looked dangerous. How could you tell?
 RIKER / But you said that you noticed they looked dangerous before the fight even started. What made you think that? Were they unusually aggressive... ? Were they heavily armed... ?
 RIKER / They murdered a man in plain view of everyone in that bar... and you can't remember anything about them?
 RIKER / But you offered to help us.
 RIKER / Do you know where they went?
 RIKER / You know who they are and you know where I can find them.
 RIKER / What do you want?
 RIKER / A shuttlecraft? (beat; smiles) Well, here's my offer. Instead of a ship, I'm going to give you some time.
 RIKER / If you're lucky, you'll only have to spend the next five years in prison instead of the next twenty.
 RIKER / (continuing) You've got twelve outstanding arrest warrants for fraud and petty theft in the Klingon Empire. If you tell me what you know, I'll pull a few strings... maybe get them to reduce your sentence after you're extradited.
 RIKER / Yes. I certainly do.
 RIKER / I'll think about it.
 RIKER / Talk!
 RIKER / Where do we find them?
 RIKER / You think?
 RIKER / (taps combadge) Riker to Data.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data here.
 RIKER / (to combadge) Take us out of orbit. Set course for the Barradas system, warp six.
 DATA / Barradas Three is the only M-class planet in this system, and it is listed as unpopulated. However, sensors have detected intermittent energy signals emanating from its surface.
 RIKER / What's the source?
 GEORDI / The signals are difficult to localize, but... they might be emissions from some kind of power converter...
 WORF / Which could indicate a base or a ship.
 RIKER / What else do we know about Barradas Three?
 DATA / The planet was an outpost of the Debrune approximately two thousand years ago. The Federation Archaeological survey has catalogued numerous ruins on the surface.
 RIKER / Mister Worf, I want a security detail to accompany the Away Team to the surface. I'll lead the team. Geordi, you're with me... Mister Data, you have the Bridge.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Sir.
 DATA / (continuing) As Acting First Officer, I must question your decision to accompany the Away Team. If Captain Picard were here --
 RIKER / (tightly) He's not.
 DATA / I realize that, sir. But if he were, and he wanted to lead an Away Team, you would tell him that the Captain's place is --
 RIKER / On the Bridge. I know. (beat) But not this time.
 GEORDI / It's tough to get accurate sensor readings... there's a lot of interference in the area.
 RIKER / From what?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure... it's unlocalized. It could be atmospheric...
 RIKER / What do you make of this?
 GEORDI / The ruins are ancient... but I'd say this indentation was made fairly recently... (unconvinced) There might have been a battle here...
 RIKER / It doesn't look like any blast point I've ever seen... the shape is too perfect.
 GEORDI / (surprised) Sir, there's micro-crystalline damage all through this area. It's the same kind of pattern Doctor Crusher picked up in the floor of that bar on Dessica Two.
 WORF (O.S.) / Commander...
 WORF / (continuing) I have found something.
 RIKER / (musing) It almost looks as if someone... dropped them --
 GEORDI / (to com) La Forge to Enterprise... we are under attack...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Repeat, we are under attack...
 DATA / Is there a malfunction?
 DATA / What is the source?
 DATA / Bridge to Transporter Room Two. Can you get a lock on the Away Team?
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S VOICE / Negative, sir. There's too much interference.
 RIKER / I'm going to try to reach those trees. If I can get there, we might be able to set up a crossfire. Keep me covered...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to Away Team... please respond...
 GEORDI / (to com) Data, we've been attacked. We've got one casualty... and Commander Riker has been taken captive.
 WORF / (to com) Sir, the mercenaries have transported away... they must have a base or a ship nearby. Can you locate anything on sensors?
 DATA / Why was it not detected earlier?
 DATA / Raise shields. Red Alert.
 DATA / Damage report.
 DATA / Take us to warp nine and pursue. Lock phasers on target.
 DATA / Increase the sensor field bandwidth. Patch in the lateral sensor arrays to enhance detection.
 DATA / Plot a course and take us back to Barradas Three. Notify the Away Team to be ready for transport.
 DATA / Starfleet Intelligence has confirmed that a ship matching this configuration has been linked to raids on several other planets in this sector.
 DATA / (continuing) For the short time it was within our visual range, we were able to take sensor readings of the mercenary vessel. (beat) It appears to be encased in an energy-absorbing material. Although we can see the ship, this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable to our long-range sensors.
 TROI / There must be some way to track it.
 GEORDI / Data, I know this is a long shot... but if I remodulate the long-range sensor array, I might be able to increase its sensitivity enough to detect the ship.
 DATA / Without a full compositional analysis of the energy sheath, the chances of finding the correct remodulation sequence are remote. (beat) Furthermore, based on their speed, they could be as far as two-point-three-seven light years from this location.
 WORF / That means they must still be within this sector. If we used all available shuttlecraft to conduct a level-one search --
 DATA / It would still take at least ten days to complete. In that time the mercenaries would continue to distance themselves from us.
 WORF / (frustrated) Sir. They have taken Commander Riker. We must do something. We cannot just sit here.
 DATA / On the contrary, Lieutenant, that is precisely what we must do.
 DATA / (continuing) Since there are no viable alternatives, we will return to the surface and attempt to determine what the mercenaries were doing on this planet. An investigation may reveal some indication of their purpose. Notify me when you have assembled your search teams. (beat) Dismissed.
 RIKER / (all I'm saying) William T. Riker, Commander, SC two-three-one dash four-two-seven.
 RIKER / We were studying the ruins. It was a scientific expedition.
 RIKER / Then what were you doing there?
 RIKER / (weakly) What happened to him?
 PICARD (O.S.) / They're right, Baran, and you know it...
 PICARD / (continuing) I say kill him. Now.
 PICARD / (re: Riker) If he has nothing to give us, then we should kill him now and be done with it. Everyone seems to recognize that fact except you.
 PICARD / He may not be as useful as you think...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... if this is the same Riker I've heard about.
 RIKER / (to Picard) And which "Riker" is that?
 PICARD / Commander of the Enterprise... ? Formerly assigned to the USS Hood... ?
 RIKER / That's right.
 PICARD / Then you must be the William T. Riker with a history of insubordination...
 PICARD / (continuing) He was even relieved of duty once, during the Cardassian incident at Minos Korva.
 PICARD / I've been smuggling artifacts out of Federation sites for years. It's difficult to avoid developing a... familiarity with certain Starfleet personnel...
 PICARD / (taunting) If we hadn't captured him, he probably would've ended up in front of a court martial.
 RIKER / (hard) I've gotten out of them before.
 PICARD / (to Baran) He's no use to us. Finish him now or let me do it for you.
 PICARD / It's the antimatter flow regulator... It's locked open...
 PICARD / The flow regulator is frozen...
 RIKER / Let me do it.
 RIKER / (to Baran) I've had a lot of experience with these kinds of system failures... I might be able to do something.
 RIKER / It looks like you've got a control logic lockout in the regulator subsystem.
 RIKER / (continuing) I'm going to try to run an active bypass through the plasma flow convertor...
 RIKER / (continuing) Start running a phase-locked feedback through the regulator... I'll need about a six second delay...
 RIKER / (cuts him off) We'll all be dead anyway. (beat, works) Just a few more seconds...
 RIKER / (to Baran) If you want to make sure that doesn't happen again, you'd better re-initialize the regulator subprocessors. A full diagnostic on the intermix chamber wouldn't hurt either.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Still wish you'd killed me?
 WORF / The search teams have reported in, sir. They located several archaeological sites. Each one has been looted.
 GEORDI / It's possible that the micro-crystalline damage I found in these indentations was the result of some kind of high-energy Transporter beam... (beat) ... but I still don't understand. There's nothing here that's particularly valuable. Why would anyone want to steal any of these things?
 DATA / Perhaps these artifacts have special value to the Romulans.
 WORF / The Romulans?
 DATA / These structures were built by the Debrune. That race was an ancient offshoot of the Romulans. And the ruins on the planet where Captain Picard was killed were also Romulan in origin.
 WORF / The leader of the group which attacked us was a Romulan. (beat) Perhaps they are controlling the mercenaries...
 DATA / But the question remains: Why are they stealing these artifacts?
 DATA / There are several archaeological sites in this sector containing ruins which are Romulan in origin. (beat, pointing) These are the locations which have been attacked by the mercenary vessel.
 GEORDI / It looks like they've done a pretty thorough job.
 DATA / The only sites which have not been attacked are on Calder Two, Yadalla Prime, and Draken Four.
 GEORDI / Yadalla and Draken are on the far edge of the sector... but Calder Two is less than a day from here at maxiumum warp.
 DATA / That would be their next likely target.
 GEORDI / According to this, there's a Federation outpost on Calder Two.
 DATA / But it is only a small science station; it has limited defensive capabilities. (beat) I do not believe it could withstand an attack by the mercenary ship.
 DATA / Mister Worf. Send a message to the Federation outpost on Calder Two. Advise them that if a ship matching the mercenary vessel's configuration approaches, they should attempt to delay them until our arrival. (to Giusti) Ensign Giusti, take us out of orbit. Set course for the Calder system. Warp nine.
 PICARD / We don't have much time...
 PICARD / (continuing) I hardly expected to see you here, Wil.
 RIKER / I was trying to find the people who killed you. (beat) A witness in that bar saw you vaporized.
 PICARD / These mercenaries use weapons which activate their Transporter. It allows them to beam away objects quickly, by simply firing at them. That's what they did to me.
 RIKER / I don't understand any of this. Who are these people? How did you get involved with them?
 PICARD / One of the sites I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of artifacts were stolen... the site was practically destroyed. I wanted to find who was responsible. (beat) I tracked them to the bar on Dessica Two. I suppose I asked too many questions... They captured me to find out how much I knew about their operation...
 RIKER / But you ended up as part of the crew...
 PICARD / I convinced them I was a smuggler named "Galen", and I offered to help them appraise the relics they'd stolen...
 PICARD / (continuing) Wil, these aren't common thieves. They're stealing Romulan artifacts from archaeological sites throughout this sector... (beat) Baran has me analyzing each one for a particular particle signature. They're looking for a specific artifact...
 RIKER / Why?
 PICARD / That's what we have to find out. And Baran is the key. I believe he's the only one on board who really knows what we're looking for. (beat) I want you to try to get close to Baran... gain his confidence.
 RIKER / That's why you set up the engine failure... you knew I'd be able to fix it...
 PICARD / (nods) He also believes you're a less than perfect Starfleet officer... you'll have to play into that role. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) Baran doesn't care much for me -- he tolerates me because he needs me to test the artifacts. If you and I become enemies, there's a better chance you can become his friend.
 RIKER / All right. I'll do what I can --
 PICARD / Getting some answers. Just because you couldn't get him to talk --
 PICARD / Calder Two isn't just another archaeological site. There's a Federation outpost there.
 PICARD / It's defended by Starfleet. They're not going to just stand by while we walk in and take whatever we want.
 PICARD / They'll also have a minimum of two phaser banks... and possibly even photon torpedoes. Is that enough to worry about?
 PICARD / I tried to smuggle a Sakethan glyph stone out of there two years ago. I barely got away in one piece.
 PICARD / Fifteen minutes is more than enough time to transmit a distress call.
 PICARD / He's right. And our landing party would be stranded on the surface.
 PICARD / That's because you won't be down there... your life won't be at risk.
 PICARD / Why? Who are we working for?
 PICARD / Maybe we do. (beat) Why don't we use Riker?
 PICARD / A Starfleet Commander might be able to talk us past the outpost security without raising any suspicions. (beat) Once they drop their shields, we could beam the artifacts up without having to leave the ship.
 PICARD / If he doesn't help us, we'll destroy the outpost and kill everyone on it. He's still a Starfleet officer... he won't let innocent people die if he can prevent it.
 PICARD / Computer. Access spectral enhancement mode three and begin scan.
 PICARD / Analysis?
 PICARD / Computer. Reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number three-six-nine-A...
 PICARD / Tell Baran if he wants the analysis done faster, he can do it himself. If he wants it done correctly, he can wait.
 PICARD / I doubt he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of the identification process by a factor of ten. I'm the best person here to analyze these artifacts, and Baran knows it.
 PICARD / Computer, begin scan.
 PICARD / I don't like operating in the dark. If I knew what the point of this mission were... why I'm scanning these relics...
 PICARD / Do you know what this is all about?
 PICARD / Then tell me what we're doing here. Why are we risking our lives taking these artifacts? Who wants them?
 PICARD / You can tell him every word I've said. He knows I don't think he's much of a leader.
 PICARD / He wouldn't be captain for five minutes if he didn't have the control device. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / The crew follows him because they have no choice. Baran's power is based only on fear and intimidation.
 PICARD / If someone were to challenge Baran -- the crew would follow.
 RIKER / I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but the outpost is in imminent danger of attack. I want to station security personnel on the surface to protect you. (beat) I am ordering you to drop your shields.
 PICARD / That would take too long. Starfleet might be here any minute...
 PICARD / I'm configuring the disruptors to fire a phase-resonant pulse... If I can hit their shield generator at precisely the right frequency, I should be able to knock it off-line with a single shot... (beat) Firing...
 PICARD / (off console) Their shields are down...
 PICARD / They've managed to get their shields back up.
 WORF / Direct hit on their aft deflector, sir... They are undamaged.
 DATA / Ensign, scan for Starfleet combadge signals. Is Commander Riker aboard that ship?
 DATA / Open a channel. (to com) This is the Federation Starship Enterprise. You are ordered to stand down...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (continuing) ... Drop your shields and prepare to be boarded.
 RIKER / That's ridiculous... when did I have the chance?
 DATA / Commander. Are you all right?
 RIKER / (hard) Withdraw the Enterprise, Mister Data. That's an order.
 DATA / (puzzled) Sir, that is impossible. The ship you are on has violated a Federation outpost. It is my duty to stop it.
 RIKER / I'm your commanding officer and I'm giving you a direct order. Understood?
 DATA / Commander, if you could explain --
 RIKER / I've never explained my orders to you before and I'm not going to start now.
 RIKER / I have no intention of letting them blow us into space. (beat) If I can set up a low energy com link between the ships... I can use my personal command codes to deactivate their shields.
 DATA / Counselor, could Commander Riker have been drugged or mentally altered in some way to explain this?
 TROI / I didn't sense anything which would indicate that...
 WORF / (off console) Commander, we are receiving some kind of signal from the mercenary ship... (beat; astonished) These are Commander Riker's access codes... he is attempting to shut down our shields...
 TROI / That doesn't make any sense. He knows those codes would have been changed as soon as he was captured...
 DATA / That is correct, Counselor. He does know. (beat) Mister Worf. Prepare to drop the shields.
 WORF / (astonished) Sir? We will be totally defenseless.
 DATA / I am aware of that.
 WORF / The moment they see our --
 DATA / That is an order.
 WORF / Aye-aye, sir.
 RIKER / It worked! Their shields are dropping...
 WORF / Direct hit to the port nacelle... (beat, then surprised) But -- only minimal damage.
 WORF / (continuing) Hit on the starboard nacelle... again, no appreciable damage.
 TROI / Wil must've done something to their weapons.
 DATA / I believe so, Counselor. It is now up to us to... play along. (to Giusti) Release inertial dampers and cut power on decks thirty-one through thirty-seven. (to Worf) Set phasers to twenty-five percent. Return fire.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (off console) We've lost three plasma relays on the disruptors. Auxiliary power... is not available.
 WORF / (urgent) Sir. We will not be able to track them with our sensors if they go to warp. I can still disable them before they --
 DATA / I am aware of the tactical situation, Lieutenant. Let them go.
 DATA / Understood. Begin sensor sweep nine using the lateral array set to maximum gain.
 TROI / I've gone over every word, every inflection, every facial response... but I still haven't found any kind of code or hidden message.
 DATA / Understood. I agree that the probability that such a message exists is remote, but I believe we should check.
 TROI / I'll keep trying.
 WORF / (to Data) Two starships have been sent to intercept the mercenaries at Yadalla Prime and Draken Four, in case they attempt to attack those planets.
 DATA / Very well. Inform Starfleet Command that we will hold position here until further notice.
 WORF / So we are just going to... remain here?
 DATA / Yes. But we will continue to pursue all avenues of investigation which are available to us.
 WORF / If we had not allowed them to escape, this would not be necessary.
 DATA / That is correct. However, I believe Commander Riker wanted us to let them escape.
 GEORDI / (excited) I think I've got something.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I've been studying the com link Commander Riker used to transmit his command codes. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / I didn't see anything at first, but when I ran the transmission through a sub-harmonic analysis I found this. (indicates graphic) It was sent on the same carrier wave as the command codes.
 TROI / (to Data) It might be the message you've been looking for.
 DATA / Possibly. I will attempt to resequence the signal. (to Geordi) Begin running a search for a decryption key.
 RIKER / (bitter) You're welcome.
 PICARD / What's wrong, Commander? Starting to have second thoughts about betraying your comrades... because that's what you've done -- betrayed them... betrayed them in order to save yourself. (beat) You were just a second-rate officer before... now you're a coward and a traitor. How does that feel?
 RIKER / I don't know. How did that feel?
 PICARD / (irritated) Tell Baran I'm working as fast as I can.
 PICARD / (continuing) What?
 PICARD / You were there. The disruptors lost power. (to computer) Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample and begin scan.
 PICARD / (sarcastic) I'm touched by your concern for my well-being.
 PICARD / Computer, reset diagnostic and begin scan. (to Tallera) I'm not a prisoner in a Romulan labor camp, Tallera. I don't have to answer your questions and I don't give a damn what you think.
 PICARD / Well, whatever it is... it looks like we've found it.
 RIKER / I take it that's good news.
 RIKER / Really?
 RIKER / I can't say I'm sorry to hear that.
 RIKER / Oh?
 RIKER / I've... pretty much come to the same conclusion.
 RIKER / I guess I'd have to look for a new career... there must be a place where someone with fifteen years of Starfleet technical knowledge would be useful. (beat) Do you know of any place like that?
 RIKER / I haven't exactly sworn my undying allegiance to you, Baran. In fact, I'd like to know a little bit more about the job.
 RIKER / Such as what you meant by a "very profitable mission."
 RIKER / I'm not exactly... the "ideal" Starfleet type.
 RIKER / Sounds promising.
 RIKER / Why?
 RIKER / Okay.
 DATA / I have completed the analysis of the signal from the mercenary ship. I believe these groupings represent bearings and coordinates taken from their navigational system.
 GEORDI / So you think this is their flight plan...
 DATA / Yes. If I am correct, the mercenary vessel is heading toward these coordinates in... (works) ... the Hyralan Sector.
 WORF / Their maximum speed is warp eight point seven... it will take them at least fourteen hours to reach that position.
 GEORDI / We could be there in five.
 DATA / Make it so.
 WORF / (annoyed) Finally.
 WORF / (continuing, to Con Officer) Set course for the Hyralan Sector and engage at warp nine.
 DATA / Lieutenant, may I see you in the Ready Room?
 WORF / Of course.
 DATA / Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with your performance as acting first officer.
 WORF / (surprised) May I... ask in what way?
 DATA / You continually question my orders in front of the crew. I do not think this is appropriate behavior.
 WORF / Sir... with all due respect, I have always felt free to voice my opinions... even when they differed from those of Captain Picard or Commander Riker.
 DATA / That is true. But in those situations, you were acting as head of security, not as First Officer. The primary role of the second in command is to carry out the decisions of the Captain... in this case, me.
 WORF / But is it not my duty to offer you... alternatives?
 DATA / Yes. But once I have made a decision, it is your job to carry it out regardless of how you may personally feel. Any further objections should be given to me in private, not in front of the crew. (beat) I do not recall Commander Riker ever publicly showing irritation with his Captain as you did a moment ago.
 WORF / (abashed) No, sir.
 DATA / If you feel that you are not capable of carrying out this role, I can assign it to Commander La Forge and return you to Tactical. I would not enter it as a reprimand on your record... simply as a transfer.
 WORF / I would... prefer to remain at my current post.
 DATA / Then I will expect you to conform to the guidelines I have laid out.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 DATA / Mister Worf... I am sorry if I have ended our friendship.
 WORF / Sir... it is I who has jeopardized our friendship, not you. If you will... overlook this incident, I would like to continue to consider myself your friend.
 DATA / I would like that as well.
 WORF / Thank you, sir.
 RIKER / I think Narik may be right this time... a constrictor coil will only align so fast. We'll have to wait.
 RIKER / I'd say another hour, maybe less.
 RIKER / I'll take care of it.
 RIKER / (wry) It's good to see you, too.
 PICARD / I've had a few... unpleasant surprises. (puts the phaser away) This isn't a good idea, Wil. Baran may get suspicious.
 RIKER / As a matter of fact, Baran's the one who sent me here. (off his look) He told me to "wake you up," but he really wants me to "pretend" to get friendly with you and then help you organize a mutiny... so he can find your supporters among the crew and eliminate them. (beat) So here I am... pretending to like you after all.
 PICARD / Wheels within wheels... I'm starting to forget which side I'm on. (beat) All right... what have you found out so far?
 RIKER / When we get to the Hyralan Sector, we're supposed to rendezvous with a Klingon transport ship. I'm not sure, but I think they might be delivering another Romulan artifact to us.
 PICARD / (puzzled) A second artifact... ? (beat) By the way, these artifacts aren't Romulan... they're Vulcan.
 RIKER / Vulcan?
 PICARD / I've been looking over the glyphs and pictograms I found on the Calder Two artifact. There's not enough data to translate the inscription, but the alphabet and symbology are more consistent with early Vulcan artifacts than Romulan.
 RIKER / Do these artifacts have some kind of religious or cultural significance... something that would make them valuable enough to kill for?
 PICARD / I don't know. (frustrated) If I could just get access to the Enterprise computer for even a few moments...
 PICARD / What will Baran do once we obtain the second artifact?
 RIKER / You're supposed to confirm it's authentic... (beat) ... and then I'm supposed to kill you and take your place.
 PICARD / (dry) You always seem to be after my job.
 PICARD / Once Baran decides I've outlived my usefulness... he can simply kill me with the neural servo. (beat) I think... we'd better start planning a mutiny.
 PICARD / We need a new captain... so I've come to one inescapable conclusion...
 PICARD / Oh?
 PICARD / And who do you think they'll follow... you?
 PICARD / What?
 PICARD / I don't know what you're talking about.
 PICARD / (shocked) Vulcan Security?
 PICARD / What sort of threat?
 PICARD / (continuing) I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
 PICARD / It sounds like a very... illogical philosophy.
 PICARD / What are these artifacts we're collecting? I know they're Vulcan in origin...
 PICARD / You were much like my people once were... a warlike, savage race...
 PICARD / The Stone of Gol... ?
 PICARD / I know the story from Vulcan mythology. According to the legend whoever possessed the stone needed only to think of throwing it at someone... and that person would be killed.
 PICARD / As I recall the legend, the Stone of Gol was destroyed by the gods when the Vulcan people found the way to peace...
 PICARD / A telepathic weapon...
 PICARD / Since Baran will presumably need to deliver the artifacts to this assassin in order to get paid, it would seem that the best course of action is to continue with our little masquerade for now.
 DATA (V.O.) / Acting Captain's Log: Stardate 47160.1. The Enterprise is entering the Hyralan Sector which I believe to be the next destination of the mercenary ship.
 DATA / All stop. Full sensor sweep.
 DATA / Is it the mercenary ship?
 WORF / It is a Toron-class shuttlecraft... one passenger.
 TROI / We're awfully far from the Klingon Empire... it can't be a coincidence the shuttle's at these coordinates.
 DATA / Agreed. (to Giusti) Open a channel.
 DATA / (continuing) I am Lieutenant Commander Data of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 DATA / I take it that is your name?
 DATA / May I inquire as to your destination?
 DATA / May I ask the purpose of your journey?
 DATA / Perhaps I have not made our intentions clear... we are investigating a --
 DATA / (continuing) He seems... most uncooperative.
 TROI / He may have been curt, but he was also very worried... even a little scared.
 WORF / Sir... I recommend that we bring the shuttle aboard with our tractor beam, search it, and interrogate Koral.
 DATA / According to the terms of the Klingon_Federation Treaty, Koral has every right to free transit through Federation space. We cannot board or search his vessel without cause.
 WORF / Yes, sir. (thinks) However... the Treaty also gives us the right to conduct... health and safety inspections of any ship in our space.
 TROI / Health and safety inspections... ?
 DATA / (thinks) Article forty-seven, paragraph three, subsection B: "Starfleet will have the right to insure all Klingon vessels comply with safety and navigational regulations as specified by mutual agreement." (beat) But I am not sure that using this clause as an excuse to conduct a search would be consistent with the spirit of the Treaty.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 DATA / However, if Koral wishes to contest our actions he can file a protest with the Judge Advocate General's office. (to Worf) Bring the shuttle aboard and then you and Doctor Crusher may begin the inspection.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / Hello. (beat) I'm Doctor Crusher, and this is Lieutenant Worf.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We're here to conduct the health and safety inspection of your ship.
 BEVERLY / That's right. You know... radiation leaks... biochemical contamination... other health hazards...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Well... no radiation so far... I'm sure you're glad to hear that...
 BEVERLY / Right.
 PICARD / How could they have found out about the rendezvous, Commander?
 RIKER / How could I have known the rendezvous coordinates? If anyone sent them a message it must've been one of you.
 PICARD / Or maybe you're a clever liar.
 PICARD / How can you be sure Koral had the piece when he was captured?
 PICARD / You have a very bad sense of humor, Baran.
 PICARD / Do you have any idea how many security officers they have on a ship like that?
 RIKER / I can get you aboard... and I can find that artifact.
 PICARD / (sarcastic) Oh, how convenient... we'll just beam you aboard your old ship and then hope that you won't change your mind and decide to betray us?
 RIKER / I've already saved your life twice, Galen. I'd think you'd start to show a little gratitude by now.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 RIKER / I haven't forgotten.
 TROI / I'm sure the health and safety inspection won't last much longer. In the meantime, I'm glad we have this opportunity to get to know you. May I ask what business you're in?
 TROI / (continuing) I hope we're not causing you too much inconvenience... were you on a tight schedule?
 DATA / (re: drinks) Lieutenant Worf has programmed our replicators to make a very good approximation of Klingon bloodwine. I think you will find it to your liking.
 BEVERLY / Well, that's my third scan and I still can't find anything out of the ordinary.
 WORF / He must be hiding something. We should download his computer memory and analyze it.
 BEVERLY / I'd have a tough time defending that as part of a safety inspection.
 WORF / We could claim that the computer was generating abnormal radiation signatures...
 BEVERLY / Worf, we're on pretty shaky ground as it is... we can't just start --
 PICARD / Don't.
 RIKER / Watch that door.
 WORF / What is going on?
 RIKER / (to Beverly) Surprised to see me, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / You could say that.
 RIKER / I decided to make a career change...
 PICARD / (closes tricorder) It's not in here. (to Worf) Where's the artifact?
 WORF / I... don't know what you're talking about.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Use your brain. They wouldn't be down here searching the shuttle if they'd already found it. Koral must have it with him. (to Beverly) Where's the Klingon pilot?
 BEVERLY / He's in the Observation Lounge with Data and Troi.
 RIKER / It's twelve decks away.
 WORF / Security will not allow you to get that far.
 RIKER / They won't get the chance. We can use the transporter in that shuttle and beam directly to the Observation Lounge.
 RIKER / (to Beverly and Worf) Sorry about this...
 DATA / Koral, if you could tell us something about the nature of your mission --
 RIKER / Quiet. (to Picard) Does he have it?
 PICARD / This is it.
 PICARD / Yes, I recognize the inscription pattern from the first artifact.
 DATA / Commander Riker, by taking this action you risk charges of assault, theft, piracy, and treason.
 RIKER / Really? Then I guess adding one more charge wouldn't hurt.
 PICARD / Is he dead?
 TROI / Yes.
 PICARD / Good. (to Narik) Activate the transporter. (to Data) Good-bye.
 DATA / Good-bye.
 DATA / (to com) Security alert. Emergency medical team to the Observation Lounge. Data to Bridge, raise shields and begin sensor sweeps for the mercenary ship.
 TROI / (to Data) He's all right. He's just stunned.
 DATA / I must admit I am experiencing the same sensation.
 RIKER / This is going to take some time to explain...
 PICARD / Oh, I do have something else for you...
 PICARD / Tell them what happened, Narik.
 PICARD / He might have killed all of us. And I believe he was acting on the direct orders of Baran. (looks at Baran) You betrayed us.
 PICARD / (continuing) I say this has gone on long enough. It's time for a new commander... someone who will lead us to the profits we've been promised.
 PICARD / A refusal to follow your orders... the orders of a small man trying to fill a role too big for him.
 PICARD / (to all) More promises of riches. More excuses for Baran to fill his own coffers while the rest of us go begging. I say it's time for a change. Who's with me?
 PICARD / (quiet) It's over, Baran.
 PICARD / You can't kill us all... you need us to run the ship more than we need you to command it.
 PICARD / I switched our transponder codes. It seemed like a prudent, if regrettable step.
 PICARD / There'll be no more "punishment" on this ship. Do your duties and I'll see to it that we complete our mission... and get our payment.
 PICARD / Maintain course and speed for now. I'm going to find out where and when we're supposed to deliver our cargo.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Commander Riker. Minister Satok of Vulcan Security is standing by on a secure channel.
 RIKER / Put it through in here.
 RIKER / Minister, I wanted to let you know that the mercenary ship which has been raiding planets in the Taugan sector is probably on its way to Vulcan right now.
 RIKER / I'm sorry. It's been a difficult couple of days. (beat) I know that one of your operatives has been investigating the assembly of the psionic resonator on a mercenary ship for several months. I didn't want someone to make a mistake and start firing at them when they approach your planet.
 PICARD / (off monitor) According to Baran's logs, the two artifacts are supposed to be delivered... to the T'Karath Sanctuary on Vulcan.
 PICARD / (to com) Galen to Bridge. Alter course for Vulcan.
 PICARD / (to Tallera) Perhaps you can help me with something... I've been able to translate most of the writing on these pieces...
 PICARD'S VOICE / For the most part, they're just warnings of death and destruction for those who oppose the resonator...
 PICARD / But this hieroglyph on the anterior has me a bit puzzled.
 PICARD'S VOICE / This is clearly the Vulcan god of war... and this is the god of death...
 PICARD / But if you look closely you can see that there is a third symbol missing -- which should be on the final piece. The odd thing is that typically, the gods of war and death would stand alone on an artifact... they would never be combined with a third glyph.
 PICARD / Hmmmm. I'm anxious to see the final artifact... it may provide a new insight into Vulcan mythology.
 PICARD / (nods agreement) We shouldn't have any problems entering orbit. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / I told Commander Riker to contact the Vulcan authorities from the Enterprise and warn them of our approach.
 PICARD / (off her reaction) I didn't want to risk a misunderstanding... someone might have mistaken this for an actual raid...
 PICARD / Perhaps I should contact the Enterprise... have them meet us at Vulcan in case these isolationists try to escape.
 PICARD / I see. (beat) Are you sure it's wise for you to go to the Sanctuary alone? After all, they're expecting Baran to show up, not you. If I accompanied you, it may seem more plausible that --
 PICARD / Of course.
 PICARD / Tallera... I've decided on a change of plan. Leave one artifact here for now. Take the other... and once we have our payment in hand, we'll complete the delivery.
 PICARD / I realize that. But it would be safer for all concerned if we kept one piece here.
 PICARD / They've waited a long time for this. They won't take any risks at this stage. Take the piece and beam down.
 PICARD / Tallera's right, I am a Starfleet officer... but what she's not telling you is that those artifacts in her hand are part of an incredibly powerful weapon. There's no reward waiting for you down on the surface. Tallera will take the artifacts and leave you here, to be captured by Starfleet.
 PICARD / (to others) You know Tallera... you know she's a woman of great patience. She's bided her time and waited for this moment. All she cares about is assembling that weapon. If she leaves this ship you'll never see her again.
 PICARD / You can't win, Tallera. Starfleet won't stand by while you tear apart one of the founding worlds of the Federation.
 PICARD / Drop your weapons! Do it!
 PICARD / (continuing) Make no aggressive movements. The resonator amplifys violent thoughts and emotions.
 PICARD / (to Tallera) That's why you wanted me to take the phaser -- and why you were able to kill Narik and Vekor. It wasn't until I saw the image on the last artifact... that I realized what the message on the resonator was. (beat) The third image is the Vulcan symbol for peace... that symbol is positioned between the symbols for war and death. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / It's a warning... that the resonator's power can be overcome by peace.
 PICARD / (to officers) Clear your minds of all aggressive thoughts...
 PICARD / Think, Tallera -- two thousand years ago, your people were being consumed by war... then they found the way of peace and logic. During the same period, the resonator was dismantled... don't you see the connection? (beat) When peace came to Vulcan, the resonator became useless. That is why it was dismantled.
 PICARD / (quiet) You were right... the resonator cannot be stopped with phasers or shields. But like every other form of violence... it can be stopped with peace.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 47169.2. Security Minister Satok has taken Tallera into custody and begun a search for the rest of the isolationists.
 RIKER / Once we realized you weren't on the mercenary ship, we scanned the surface for your neural implant... and tracked the signal to the cavern.
 DATA / What will happen to the resonator?
 PICARD / Satok assured me that all three pieces will be destroyed.
 DATA / It is unfortunate that it cannot be studied. The resonator is a key artifact from a remarkable period of history.
 PICARD / Normally, I would be the first to agree with you... but perhaps there are some things best left in the past.
 RIKER / What's going to happen to the mercenaries?
 PICARD / They have been detained by the Vulcan authorities, for the moment. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / But they're also facing charges from the Klingons, the Cardassians, the Ferengi, and about seven other worlds. We won't be hearing from them for quite some time.
 PICARD / Number One, set course for Starbase two-twenty-seven. I'll be on the Bridge shortly.
 RIKER / (with humor) Wait a minute... You were declared dead, remember? You can't give orders around here.
 DATA / (to Riker) If we are to adhere to the exact letter of Starfleet regulations, then technically sir, you have been declared a renegade. In fact, I believe you are facing twelve counts of court martial offenses. You cannot give orders either.
 PICARD / (to Data) Quite right. I'm going to get some sleep. In the meantime I suggest you escort Commander Riker to the brig.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 DATA / This way, sir...
 RIKER / Data, he was just joking... you know that, right? Data?
 DATA is walking along, carrying a PADD. GEORDI catches / up to him from behind... out of breath, excited about something.
 GEORDI / Data, there you are... we need to install that plasma conduit right away. We're bringing the new warp core on-line in less than three hours.
 DATA / I will go to deck twenty and begin modifications.
 GEORDI / Great. Meet me in Engineering as soon as you're finished. (excited) This should be a lot of fun.
 DATA / Excuse me. Do you have authorization to work in this area?
 DATA / (continuing) You are dismantling a warp plasma conduit. I must ask you to stop.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47225.7. Commander La Forge has completed the installation of our new warp core. We are preparing to test its capabilities.
 RIKER and various N.D.s at their stations. PICARD / ENTERS from his Ready Room, looking very grim-faced. Riker takes note.
 RIKER / Something wrong, sir?
 PICARD / I just got a message from Starfleet command.
 RIKER / Bad news?
 PICARD / You could say that...
 PICARD / (continuing) I've been invited to the annual Starfleet Admiral's banquet.
 RIKER / My condolences.
 PICARD / I've managed to avoid it for the last six years. I guess my luck just ran out... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) I can't imagine anything more tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking hands, making dull conversation... uninteresting food... boring speeches...
 RIKER / Can't you find an excuse not to go?
 PICARD / After six years, I don't have any excuses left. Besides, I've been invited by Admiral Nakamura, the Sector Commander. He'd consider it an insult if I turned him down.
 RIKER / (with humor) We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the neutral zone and attack the Romulans... that should get you out of the banquet.
 PICARD / (wry) I wouldn't count on it.
 DATA / Have you ever had nightmares before?
 GEORDI / Sure. Everybody does from time to time...
 DATA / I have had one hundred eleven dreams since I first discovered the program nine months ago. In all of that time, I have never experienced such strange and disturbing imagery in a dream. (beat) I believe it was... a nightmare.
 GEORDI / Nightmares are part of dreaming, Data. Maybe you just discovered a new level to your program.
 DATA / Perhaps. I have also noted that I am spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about nightmare imagery. One could almost say that I am... preoccupied.
 GEORDI / Well, that's perfectly normal. When I have a nightmare, sometimes I can't shake that weird feeling for days...
 GEORDI / Speaking of nightmares...
 GEORDI / That's great. Thank you, Ensign.
 GEORDI / Well. Ah... why don't you go help Farrel check the deuterium cartridges. We're about to bring the warp core on-line.
 DATA / Geordi, you do not seem to appreciate Ensign Tyler's enthusiasm.
 GEORDI / Oh, she's enthusiastic all right... about me.
 DATA / I do not understand.
 GEORDI / She has a crush on me, Data.
 DATA / And you do not share her affection?
 GEORDI / Frankly, no. And it's getting a little awkward...
 DATA / I believe I understand. You are concerned about unintentionally hurting Ensign Tyler's feelings.
 GEORDI / Yeah... something like that...
 DATA / It would appear that you require a third party to intervene on your behalf. I would be happy to speak to her.
 GEORDI / (quickly) No, Data... I'll take care of it myself. Thanks.
 DATA / When I first woke up from my nightmare, there --
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Commander La Forge. What's our status?
 GEORDI / (taps communicator) We're ready to bring the core on-line, Captain. Stand by. (to Data) All right. Let's do it.
 GEORDI / Initializing deuterium infusion sequence...
 GEORDI / (re: core) It's a beauty, isn't it? Now let's see how fast she can run... (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (to com) La Forge to Bridge. Warp power at your discretion, Captain.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (then) Ensign Russell, plot a course to Starbase Two-nineteen. Warp six.
 PICARD / (continuing) Engage.
 PICARD / (continuing, a little louder) Engage...
 PICARD / (continuing, to com) Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge... why isn't my ship moving?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I'm on it, sir. There's a warp plasma conduit out of alignment, but I think I've fixed it... (beat) Ready, sir.
 PICARD / Very well. Ensign Russell?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / Stand by, Captain...
 DATA / I will take the warp engines off-line.
 GEORDI / (to com) La Forge to Bridge. I'm sorry, Captain. We're going to have to reconfigure the plasma conduit. It's going to take a few hours at least, sir.
 DATA / Enter.
 TROI ENTERS. She is wearing her regulation Starfleet / uniform.
 TROI / Hello, Data...
 TROI / (continuing) What are you doing?
 DATA / I am watching Spot sleep. In the past fifteen minutes, he has had twelve muscles spasms, which indicates that he is dreaming. (beat) I have often wondered what he dreams about. His twitching and his rapid breathing would seem to suggest anxiety -- but Spot has never seen a mouse or any other form of rodentia. Nor has he encountered an insect, or been chased by a canine.
 TROI / (continuing) I understand you've had some interesting dreams lately... (off his look) Geordi was a little worried about you. He just wanted me to check in and see how you were doing...
 DATA / That was very thoughtful of him. (beat) I have been debating whether or not to initiate another dream sequence.
 TROI / Because of the nightmares... ?
 DATA / (nods) I have found them to be quite... unsettling.
 TROI / Data, you shouldn't be afraid to experience dark imagery in your dreams. It's a natural expression of your unconscious... (catches herself) ... if you have an unconscious. I'm not really sure how your positronic brain works... but if it's anything like our brains, then there's part of you that's trying to express itself through your dream state. And I think you should allow yourself to experience it. (beat) As Sigmund Freud would have said... "Dreams are the royal road to the knowledge of the mind."
 DATA / Thank you, Counselor. I believe I will initialize the dream program now.
 TROI / (smiles) Let me know how it goes. Good night, Data.
 DATA / Good night, Counselor.
 DATA / (continuing) Good night, Spot.
 DATA / (continuing) Computer -- dim lights.
 WORF / Mmm. It is delicious.
 DATA / What kind of cake are you eating?
 WORF / (matter of fact) It is cellular peptide cake... with mint frosting. Would you like a bite?
 DATA / No, thank you.
 DATA / (continuing) Excuse me, Mister Worf.
 RIKER / (re: ringing) Aren't you going to answer that, Mister Data?
 DATA / Sir?
 RIKER / That damn ringing. Answer it, will you?
 DATA / Yes sir.
 DATA / (to workmen) Please identify yourselves.
 DATA / (continuing) I must know what you are trying to --
 DATA / Counselor...
 TROI / (scared) Data, please... don't hurt me..
 DATA / I am sorry, Counselor.
 TROI / No...
 TROI / Data, no! DATA!
 TROI / Data!
 DATA / What is wrong?
 TROI / We've been trying to wake you up for the past five minutes.
 GEORDI / When you didn't show up in Engineering on time, I got worried... I called security...
 DATA / My internal chronometer was supposed to wake me thirty-five minutes ago.
 WORF / You must have... overslept.
 DATA / That is not possible... (beat) Something is wrong.
 GEORDI / I can't find anything wrong with your internal time-base... and as far as I can tell, your primary systems check out fine.
 DATA / My chronometer is functioning normally, as well. (beat) I will compare my autonomic logs to the ship's chronometer. Perhaps we overlooked something.
 GEORDI / You know, Data... there's a lot we don't know about your dream program. Maybe it was designed to cause some side-effects... (beat) For all we know, Doctor Soong intended for you to oversleep now and then... as part of the human experience.
 DATA / It is a possibility. However, I would prefer to make certain there are no anomalies in my neural net.
 GEORDI / I'm curious... what were you dreaming about when we woke you up?
 DATA / I have not fully assimilated its impact. I would prefer to study the images further before discussing them.
 GEORDI / Sure... I understand. (beat) Sounds like it must've been pretty strange...
 DATA / "Strange" is not a sufficient adjective to describe the experience.
 DATA / It is difficult to explain. Counselor Troi's body was -- a cake.
 DATA / It had a black handle and a serrated blade. And it was quite long.
 DATA / Approximately twenty-five centimeters in length.
 DATA / One of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder. At that moment, I felt an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out of the cake.
 DATA / Yes. As I began to slice the cake, she reacted as though I was causing her pain. And yet, I could not stop cutting. (beat) It was then that I woke up.
 DATA / I am curious, Doctor Freud... what do my nightmares mean?
 DATA / I do not understand.
 DATA / But I do not have a mother.
 DATA / I have no sexual desires.
 DATA / I do not believe I am being helped by this session.
 DATA / That will not be necessary. (to computer) Computer -- end program.
 WORF / (off console) Captain. Incoming message from Admiral Nakamura.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Admiral.
 PICARD / Actually, we've been experiencing a few minor difficulties with our new warp core. But my Chief Engineer assures me that we'll be under way within the hour.
 PICARD / My apologies, Admiral.
 PICARD / Oh, no... certainly not, sir. I'm looking forward to it.
 RIKER / (lightly) I think he's on to you, sir.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Bridge.
 PICARD / (to com) Go ahead, Geordi.
 GEORDI / We've just started her up, sir. All systems are holding steady... (beat) Ready when you are, Captain.
 PICARD / Ensign Russell -- set course and engage.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Engineering -- report!
 DATA / (to com, off console) The warp field has collapsed, sir.
 GEORDI / (off console) It looks like we've blown out the entire power converter, Captain. Impulse engines are down, too -- we're not going anywhere... (quickly) But I know exactly how to fix it. Give me two, three hours, tops.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Now what?
 RIKER / Talk about going nowhere fast.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, open a channel to Starbase Two-nineteen. Advise Admiral Nakamura... I'll be later than I thought.
 GEORDI / (to Tyler) Tyler, how are you coming with that relay diagnostic?
 DATA / Ensign Tyler still appears to have a "crush" on you, Geordi. It is clear that you did not speak with her.
 GEORDI / (annoyed) I haven't had a chance, Data... (beat) Here. Give me a hand with this coil brace.
 GEORDI / (re: bracing) Could you perform a metallurgical scan on the brace... see if there are any microfractures? Be careful, it's kind of sharp.
 GEORDI / Is there a problem, Data?
 DATA / I am reminded of a recent dream. This brace is reminiscent of...
 RIKER'S VOICE / Aren't you going to answer that, Commander?
 RIKER / What are you waiting for? Answer it!
 DATA / (into phone) Hello?
 GEORDI'S VOICE / Data.
 GEORDI / Data, what's wrong?
 DATA / I do not know.
 DATA / Everything seems to remind me of the nightmare -- objects, sounds, smells. And now I have seen elements from the dream while still in a waking state. (beat) I cannot explain it.
 TROI / Data... if you were one of my human patients, I might be concerned right now. I'd say you had a waking dream... or a hallucination... (beat) But you're not human. It seems to me that we might be looking at some sort of technological problem...
 DATA / I have run three complete self-diagnostics. All of my systems are functioning normally.
 DATA / (continuing) I have studied over one hundred thirty-eight different theories of dream analysis in an effort to explain my nightmares.
 TROI / What have you found?
 DATA / I have been unable to find a single interpretation of my nightmares. For instance, Neo-Platonic hermetic texts from the Ancient Near East would suggest that my experience indicates a prophetic function -- that I have perceived an impending disaster. (beat) Professor Syrus of Tilonus Four would consider my dreams nothing more than epi-phenomena in my neural net. Random discharges with no meaning whatsoever. (beat) Doctor Freud of early Twentieth century Earth suggested that my dreams represent a latent psychosexual complex.
 DATA / (continuing) Perhaps Freud was correct... and the knife I dreamed of is the embodiment of my unconscious desire to inflict violence.
 TROI / Data... even Freud said "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar." (beat) A lot of the theories you've examined are interesting... but they're also flawed and obsolete.
 TROI / (continuing) That knife could just as well be an archetypal symbol of rational clarity -- it's sharp... it cuts through things that are dull...
 TROI / (continuing) The bottom line is... I think you may be developing an almost... obsessive interest in your own inner-workings. (beat) I'd almost call it the beginnings of a... neurosis.
 DATA / That is not possible.
 TROI / Why not? You've eliminated all the technical explanations. And it makes sense that as your neural net becomes more complex... more human... you might experience the same kind of psychological complexities as a human.
 DATA / (hopeful) Do you really think it is possible?
 TROI / You may be the first person who's come into my office who's actually been excited by the prospect of a new neurosis. (beat) But yes... I do think it's possible. In fact, I'd like to start counseling you on a regular basis.
 DATA / (pleased) Daily?
 TROI / No... we'll start weekly. And as a first step, I want you to shut down your dream program until our next session... just to be safe. Give yourself a chance to reflect on this experience.
 DATA / Thank you, Counselor. I look forward to our next meeting.
 TROI / And Data... (lightly) Next time... see me before you see Sigmund.
 PICARD / Admiral, I can explain...
 PICARD / Unfortunately, the problem has affected our impulse systems now. At the moment, we are... adrift.
 PICARD / That won't be necessary. I have full confidence in my Engineering staff. I will be at the banquet on time.
 PICARD / Yes, I know... it sounds... delightful.
 PICARD / Yes, sir. Picard out.
 PICARD / That won't be necessary. I have full confidence in my Engineering staff. I will be at the banquet on time.
 PICARD / Yes, I know... it sounds... delightful.
 PICARD / Yes, sir. Picard out.
 PICARD / Have you tried reconfiguring the plasma conduit?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir... we did that two hours ago.
 PICARD / What about the relays? Have you made absolutely sure they don't need a new phase invertor?
 DATA / I am currently running a level three diagnostic on the relays, sir. We will have the results of the analysis in approximately ten minutes.
 PICARD / I see...
 PICARD / Perhaps I can help you reconfigure these isolinear chips...
 GEORDI / No, sir, please don't touch that --
 GEORDI / Sir... Commander Data and I have the situation under control. If you'd just let the two of us take care of it... we can get the work done a lot faster...
 PICARD / You're right... (beat) If you don't mind, I'll just wait here and observe your progress.
 GEORDI / Actually, Captain...
 PICARD / Not at all. I'd be happy to...
 GEORDI / (quiet, to himself) Good work, Ensign. I thought he'd never leave... (beat) Data, would you help me lock down this plasma conduit... ?
 GEORDI / Data?
 GEORDI / Data... ?
 TROI / (to lift) Deck Thirty-six.
 TROI / Hello, Data.
 TROI / (continuing) Data... are you all right?
 TROI / (continuing) What are you doing?
 DATA / I am sorry, Counselor.
 TROI / NO!
 WORF / Ever since you gave Alexander that music program... he has been playing it all night... every night.
 RIKER / I was just trying to broaden his horizons. Besides, he likes it.
 WORF / It is screeching... pounding... dissonant. It is not music.
 RIKER / Worf, it's better than music -- it's jazz.
 RIKER / Data -- !
 RIKER / (taps his communicator) Medical emergency, deck seventeen, section three alpha!
 DATA / I believe I had another waking dream, sir. But this time, I felt an uncontrollable urge to... eliminate the image I saw.
 PICARD / And what you saw was some sort of a... "mouth" on Counselor Troi's shoulder...
 DATA / Yes, sir. And for a reason I cannot explain, I felt the need to destroy it.
 RIKER / What about me? Did you see one of these mouths on my head?
 DATA / No, sir. I saw a straw coming out of your head.
 PICARD / A straw?
 DATA / As I said, these are all images that I originally experienced in my dream program. I do not have a rational explanation for them.
 RIKER / But you said you shut down your dream program...
 DATA / That is correct.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / We've run every possible diagnostic on Data's positronic net... but we can't find anything wrong. I can run a sub-polymer scan... but it'll take some time to get the equipment together.
 PICARD / Make it so. (to Data) In the meantime, Mister Data... I'm going to have to relieve you of duty and confine you to quarters.
 DATA / A sensible precaution, sir.
 BEVERLY / (to Troi) It's all right, Deanna... you're in Sickbay. Everything's going to be all right.
 TROI / Data...
 BEVERLY / He's not here... try to relax.
 BEVERLY / The vascular pad has healed your wound. But you've lost a lot of blood... so I want you to lie still for a while.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) That's odd... there shouldn't be any discoloration after the treatment. This looks like some sort of rash...
 TROI / What is it?
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) I'm picking up cellular degradation. But I don't think it's related to the lacerations... (scans) And there's some kind of residual interphasic signature...
 BEVERLY / (to Nurse) Nurse, get me an interphasic scanner... I want to take a closer look.
 BEVERLY / Does that hurt?
 TROI / Not at all...
 WORF / I will have to confiscate your sidearm.
 DATA / May I ask a personal favor?
 WORF / Yes?
 DATA / Will you take care of Spot for me?
 WORF / Your... animal?
 DATA / (nods) I am concerned that if I have another waking dream, I may... injure him.
 WORF / Of course.
 WORF / (continuing) Spot. Come here.
 DATA / Unlike a canine, Spot will not respond to verbal commands.
 DATA / (continuing) Goodbye, Spot.
 DATA / (continuing) He will need to be fed once a day. He prefers feline supplement one-twenty-five.
 WORF / I understand.
 DATA / And he will require water. And you must also provide him with a sand box.
 DATA / (continuing, one last thing) And you must talk to him. Tell him he is a pretty cat, and a good cat...
 WORF / (cutting him off) I will... feed him.
 DATA / Perhaps that will be enough.
 BEVERLY / Captain. We have a problem. Take a look at this...
 BEVERLY / (continuing, re: rash) Her tissue is breaking down on a cellular level... and it's spreading. At first I thought it was a rash from the coil brace she was stabbed with... but when I used the interphasic scanner, I found something else...
 PICARD / What is it?
 BEVERLY / The better question is... what are they?
 BEVERLY / I've only checked the medical staff... but I've found them on almost everyone so far...
 BEVERLY / The infestation rate has reached seventy-three percent of the crew so far. The cellular decay is accelerating in all cases. I haven't found a way to stop it... or even slow it down.
 RIKER / What are we dealing with here? Are these creatures... feeding off us?
 BEVERLY / In a way... They appear to be extracting our cellular peptides. It's roughly analogous to the way Terran leeches consume hemoglobin.
 PICARD / Can we reverse the process?
 BEVERLY / Not until the organisms are removed. And if they're not removed soon, our bodies will begin to lose all cellular cohesion... we'll collapse into nothing but a few pounds of chemicals.
 PICARD / Can we affect the organisms in any way?
 GEORDI / We've tried E-M radiation... subspace fields... thermal protons... nothing works. They seem to exist in an interphasic state, just beyond our visual and sensor acuity. The only way we can see them is to use an IP scanner... tricorders can't even pick them up.
 RIKER / Do we know where these things came from?
 WORF / I have scanned the vicinity with an IP scanner. There is no sign of any similar creatures, or any unusual interphasic activity.
 PICARD / Perhaps Starbase Eighty-four... could we have picked them up there during the installation of the warp core?
 GEORDI / I contacted the Starbase and had them use IP scanners. Nothing.
 PICARD / What about Mister Data? There must be some connection between his odd behavior and these creatures. Is he infested, as well?
 BEVERLY / No. I scanned him, but I didn't find anything.
 PICARD / Data attacked Counselor Troi because he said he saw a... "mouth" on her shoulder... (to Beverly) And in that same area, you first discovered one of the organisms...
 RIKER / (onto idea) He also saw a "straw" on the side of my head... and Beverly found an organism in the same spot.
 GEORDI / (thinks) Those were all images from his dreams... maybe he's unconsciously perceiving these creatures...
 PICARD / I think it's time we took a closer look at Mister Data's dreams.
 DATA / It is an interesting hypothesis. If I am being affected by these interphasic creatures on an unconscious level, it may also explain my waking dreams, and my subsequent anti-social behavior.
 GEORDI / What we want to do is link your neural net into the Holodeck... and have you activate your dream program, so as you're dreaming... we can observe the dream images.
 PICARD / Perhaps we can learn more about the creatures by interpreting the symbols and images in your dreams.
 DATA / (onto the idea) I see. The concept is similar to the method of Directed Dreaming.
 PICARD / Exactly. (to Geordi) How soon can you have the link ready?
 GEORDI / We'd need about an hour to establish all the interface parameters.
 PICARD / Make it so. (beat) In the meantime, Mister Data... I'd say you should prepare for bed.
 GEORDI / I think we're ready, Captain... the link is active, and the Holodeck has been calibrated to Data's neural net.
 PICARD / Ready, Mister Data?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (to Data) Normally, I would wish you pleasant dreams... but in this case, bad dreams would be more helpful.
 DATA / I understand. (thinks) I am initializing my dream program. Stand by...
 PICARD / Keep your eyes peeled. Even an apparently insignificant image could be an important symbol.
 GEORDI / Right...
 DATA / Hello.
 PICARD / Can we talk to Data directly... or will that wake him up?
 GEORDI / He should be perceiving us as just another part of his dream. Anything we say to him will be taken in that context...
 PICARD / That sounds like a telephone ringer... (looks around) I don't see a receiver...
 DATA / Cake?
 PICARD / Thank you.
 PICARD / (continuing) Look at that... her right shoulder... the same place he stabbed her...
 GEORDI / Wait a minute... in his waking dream, he said there was a mouth on her shoulder...
 PICARD / (thinking) They're both symbols of... consumption. Food... a mouth... (to Data) Mister Data, what kind of cake is this?
 DATA / (matter of fact) It is cellular peptide cake.
 WORF / (chiming in) With mint frosting.
 GEORDI / Cellular peptides... that's exactly what the creatures are extracting.
 RIKER'S VOICE / Will someone answer that damn ringing!
 RIKER / (to Picard, urgent) Captain -- the ringing is getting worse.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) What could the ringing symbolize? Sound... a bell... an old way of communicating...
 BEVERLY / Want some? It's delicious.
 RIKER / Will somebody please get that!
 GEORDI / (into phone) Yes... ?
 GEORDI / It's for you.
 PICARD / (into phone) Picard.
 PICARD / Kill who?
 PICARD / Who is this?
 GEORDI / (to Picard) How does he fit into all this?
 PICARD / You mean, the interphasic organisms...
 PICARD / Tell me, Doctor... how can we kill them?
 PICARD / (re: workmen) What do they represent?
 GEORDI / I don't know... but I recognize that junction they're working on. It's the plasma conduit we installed with the new warp core...
 PICARD / (re: ringing) "Respond"... respond to them... what does that mean?
 GEORDI / (to workmen) What is it you're doing?
 PICARD / (to workmen) Who are you?
 DATA / (to workmen) Stop. You are hurting my friends and I must --
 PICARD / (quickly, to Data) Data, the shrieking noise you made -- it causes them pain!
 DATA / I believe I understand.
 DATA / (urgent, to Geordi) Geordi, you must adjust my positronic subprocessor to emit an interphasic pulse.
 PICARD / Data, what's going on?
 DATA / (explains) The workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are trying to demolish the ship. The incessant ringing of the telephone, and Freud's cautions at the other end, were warnings of the dangers around us.
 PICARD / What about the shrieking noise you made?
 DATA / My positronic subprocessors were detecting high-frequency interphasic signatures from the organisms... which were symbolically represented in my dreams by the high shriek.
 PICARD / When you made those sounds, the workmen reacted in pain...
 DATA / That is why I have asked Geordi to adjust my subprocessor. If I can produce a high-frequency interphasic pulse, it may have a similar effect on the creatures.
 GEORDI / Ready...
 PICARD / (taps communicator) Picard to Sickbay. Beverly, we're going to be sweeping the ship with a high-frequency IP pulse. Monitor the creatures for any response.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Understood.
 BEVERLY / (to com) It's working, Captain...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental The creatures infesting the Enterprise have been completely eliminated. We believe the infestation originated within the warp core we obtained on Starbase Eighty-four.
 GEORDI / (re: conduit) This conduit was manufactured on Thanatos Seven using a new interphasic fusion process. We think that process must've attracted the organisms to the conduit... where they lay dormant... until we activated the warp core. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (beat) That's also why we couldn't get the warp core on-line. The creatures were disrupting the plasma flow.
 PICARD / How long until we have warp power again?
 GEORDI / We'll have to manufacture a new conduit. I'd say another six hours.
 PICARD / The banquet is in eight hours... (beat) Take your time. Give yourself another twelve hours, if you need it.
 GEORDI / Understood, sir.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Ensign Tyler.
 GEORDI / There's something I've been meaning to tell you...
 GEORDI / Thanks. You've been doing a great job. We've got to work on toning down your enthusiasm a little... but I think you're going to fit in just fine.
 DATA / Enter.
 DATA / (continuing) Counselor, I did not get a chance to apologize for my behavior...
 TROI / Data, don't worry about it. Geordi explained everything. It wasn't your fault. (beat) But somehow I felt turnabout would be fair play... so I made us a little something to snack on...
 DATA / I wonder... what would Freud say about the symbolism of devouring oneself?
 TROI / Data... sometimes a cake is just a cake.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47254.1. A delegation of the Cairn have just come on board. This telepathic species has no concept of spoken language, and is being instructed in its use by... an old friend.
 PICARD / It must have been.
 PICARD / I can imagine...
 PICARD / Really?
 PICARD / I'd be happy to.
 GEORDI / ... it's called a VISOR. It lets me see things.
 DATA / It is often the case that children learn languages more easily than adults.
 GEORDI / (looking around) Should be here someplace...
 DATA / Mrs. Troi, are you all right?
 WORF / I do not care for telepaths. They make me... uneasy.
 RIKER / (looking around) She was working, but she said she'd be here -- ah -- speak of the devil.
 TROI / Sorry I'm late. I lost track of the time.
 TROI / Hello.
 TROI / (continuing) Pleased to meet you.
 TROI / Well, Maques... what do you think of the Enterprise?
 TROI / I'm glad you think so.
 TROI / You've learned a great deal in a very short time. I'm sure it won't be long before your words will do justice to your thoughts.
 TROI / Need?
 TROI / Why did you do that, Mother? You embarrassed both of us.
 TROI / Please, Mother... don't start.
 TROI / Stop it, mother.
 TROI / (continuing) Are you coming?
 TROI / What's wrong... ?
 TROI / Nothing's going to happen to me...
 TROI / My first appointment isn't for a few minutes... why don't we talk for a while?
 TROI / Are you sure?
 TROI / Maques...
 TROI / You don't have to --
 TROI / It wasn't your fault. My mother misled you.
 TROI / Yes.
 TROI / You mean you've never had telepathy with someone who wasn't Cairn?
 TROI / In what way?
 TROI / Dark?
 TROI / I'm not sure... (she considers) Did you ask my Mother about this?
 TROI / (realizing) Of course.
 TROI / You said that among the Cairn, nothing is hidden. We value honesty, but we don't always share everything we're thinking and feeling.
 TROI / Yes.
 TROI / For us, yes.
 TROI / (smiles) It is our way.
 TROI / I'm glad you stopped by.
 TROI / I was all set for another round of arguing when all of a sudden she just... fell apart.
 RIKER / She's been under a lot of stress, preparing the Cairn to meet with the Federation Council.
 TROI / It's more than that. I've been sensing very... erratic emotions from her. Even the clothes she's wearing seem unusual -- very subdued.
 RIKER / Maybe you better have a talk with her --
 RIKER / Mrs. Troi --
 TROI / Mother!
 TROI / (standing) That's enough.
 TROI / You're coming with me --
 BEVERLY / She's fine, except her psilosynine levels are a little low.
 TROI / That's a neurotransimitter involved in telepathy.
 BEVERLY / It's been depleted by your work with the Cairn. You're going to have to avoid telepathic communication for a while.
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry, but you're going to have to take some time and rest.
 TROI / Maybe I can help with the Cairn.
 TROI / Then I won't use telepathy; we'll work verbally.
 TROI / No, you'll work verbally too. The point is for you to rest. Besides, it'll be good for them to have to figure things out with words.
 TROI / This is the ship's arboretum.
 TROI / Very good, Hedril. People like to come here to relax, enjoy themselves in a natural setting.
 TROI / (continuing) "Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose... "
 TROI / (continuing) That's from an old earth poem by John Milton.
 TROI / Poetry is... an art-form that uses words, put together in new and unexpected ways -- sometimes in rhyme.
 TROI / (continuing) Milton was speculating that in Heaven, roses wouldn't have thorns.
 TROI / Heaven is... it's a...
 TROI / Mother, you're supposed to be avoiding telepathy.
 TROI / You don't look well.
 TROI / Don't worry... she'll be fine...
 TROI / Mother!
 TROI / (continuing) Mother... ?
 TROI / (continuing) Troi to Sickbay... medical emergency in the arboretum...
 BEVERLY / She's not responding to cortical stimulation. I'm not sure what more I can do...
 TROI / I don't understand... she was fine just yesterday.
 BEVERLY / I've never seen anything like this. It's almost as if her brain has... shut itself down.
 PICARD / Is there any physiological cause?
 BEVERLY / I'm running a sub-neural scan, but as far as I can see there's no tissue damage, no neuro-chemical imbalance, no sign of infection -- nothing.
 PICARD / Yet her neural activity is practically non-existent.
 BEVERLY / The only exception is in the paracortex -- activity there is almost off the scale.
 TROI / The paracortex is the Betazoid telepathic lobe. (concerned) She communicated with Maques telepathically just before she fell...
 PICARD / Might there be some side-effect of Cairn telepathy that we're not aware of?
 BEVERLY / It's a possibility.
 PICARD / (to Troi) I think you and I had better have a talk with Maques.
 PICARD / Maques, is it possible that your telepathic communications with Mrs. Troi harmed her in some way?
 TROI / What thoughts, Maques? Take your time...
 TROI / I don't understand.
 PICARD / Counsellor --
 PICARD / (continuing, to Maques) Stop it!
 TROI / It's all right, Captain.
 TROI / (continuing) I'm fine... He was just trying to communicate with me telepathically.
 TROI / I... I'm not sure...
 TROI / He communicated so much to me that at first it was just a jumble of images.
 BEVERLY / Have you been able to sort any of it out?
 TROI / I think so... during his telepathic contact with my Mother, Maques sensed what he calls a "dark place."
 TROI / He tried to tell me about it before, in my office. I misunderstood, I thought he was talking about thoughts she was keeping private. What he meant was that something was happening in her meta-conscious mind.
 BEVERLY / Meta-conscious?
 TROI / It's a part of the Betazoid psyche. A kind of... filtering mechanism to protect us from psychic trauma.
 PICARD / Is Maques suggesting that Lwaxana's meta-conscious is damaged somehow?
 TROI / He feels that whatever is wrong with her is centered there. If he's right... that may mean that she's suffered some kind of trauma that her meta-conscious can't tolerate.
 BEVERLY / Did your Mother mention anything that happened to her lately, something that might have been traumatic for her?
 TROI / No. Nothing like that.
 BEVERLY / Maques could be wrong about this. There's still a chance that the sub-neural scan will pinpoint an physiological cause for your Mother's condition, something I'll be able to treat.
 BEVERLY / The results won't be in until morning; maybe we should all get some rest.
 TROI / (to Beverly) I'd like to stay here with her... I'm going to try to contact her telepathically.
 BEVERLY / All right.
 TROI (V.O.) / Mother... can you hear me... ?
 TROI (V.O.) / (continuing) Please come back to me... please...
 TROI (V.O.) / Mother... ?
 TROI (V.O.) / How? How can I help you?
 TROI / Tell me, Mother. Please.
 TROI / Computer, lights!
 TROI / (alarmed) What are you doing?
 PICARD / What were you doing in Sickbay, Maques?
 TROI / How... what were you trying to do?
 TROI / I don't understand.
 TROI / Tell me, telepathically.
 TROI / (continuing) Maques believes my Mother's psyche has... collapsed in on itself -- that for some reason, she's retreated into her meta-conscious mind.
 PICARD / Was he trying to contact her telepathically?
 TROI / Yes. He was able to access images being generated by her meta-conscious mind. But he couldn't make any sense of them...
 TROI / He saw faces he didn't recognize, events he couldn't interpret.
 BEVERLY / If we could decipher those images, it might help us determine whether or not your Mother's condition was induced by some traumatic event.
 TROI / Maques believes he can provide a... telepathic "bridge" that will allow me to access her meta-conscious. If he can, I might be able to find out what happened to her.
 PICARD / If you succeed, would you be able to use that information to help your Mother?
 TROI / I'm not sure. But I do know that some part of her wants to be helped. When I tried to contact her telepathically, I heard a voice calling out to me.
 PICARD / If her psyche has... "collapsed in on itself," could accessing her mind pose any danger to you?
 TROI / There's no way to know.
 TROI / (continuing) Sir, I'd like to try...
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) I'll be monitoring her through the whole procedure. If anything goes wrong, Maques can break the telepathic link.
 TROI / I understand.
 TROI / (unsure) Mother... ?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Counselor... can you hear me... ?
 TROI / (unsure) Captain... ?
 PICARD / Deanna... Doctor Crusher is concerned that your para-cortical readings have become erratic.
 TROI / Are you... talking to me from Sickbay?
 PICARD / Yes. I want you to sever your connection to your Mother.
 TROI / Why don't you ask Maques to do it?
 PICARD / I'm asking you.
 PICARD / (continuing) That's an order, Counselor.
 TROI / You're not Captain Picard.
 PICARD_LWAXANA / Leave me alone... please...
 TROI / (to herself) This isn't real... none of this is real...
 TROI / Daddy... ?
 TROI / Don't do this...
 TROI / You're not my father... you're a part of Mother's mind...
 TROI / What is this place?
 TROI / Did I live here?
 TROI / I don't remember these toys...
 TROI / I do remember... I always felt safe when you sang to me...
 TROI / (a whisper) Down in the valley...
 TROI / No... no... you're trying to keep me here... keep me from finding something...
 TROI / I have to help her...
 TROI / But... she called out to me.... she does want my help.
 TROI / Goodbye, daddy.
 TROI / Hedril... ?
 TROI / (continuing) Mother...
 TROI / No!
 TROI / I asked your Father to bring you here because I wanted to talk to you about something. (beat) You know that Lwaxana is sick, don't you?
 TROI / No... not at all. But... I believe my Mother has been thinking about you. Do you know why?
 TROI / Why do you say that?
 TROI / (to Maques) Do you have any idea why Hedril would make my Mother sad?
 TROI / Thank you for coming to talk to us. I'll see you later, all right?
 TROI / Thank you, Hedril. So do I.
 TROI / I just don't understand how she fits in to all this...
 BEVERLY / I still haven't been able to find a physiological cause for what's happened to your Mother. That makes me think that Maques was right, that her condition was precipitated by some traumatic event.
 PICARD / Could this event have involved Hedril?
 TROI / I don't think so. My Mother never mentioned her.
 BEVERLY / Does your mother make personal logs... or keep a journal?
 TROI / Yes, she does. I'll contact Mister Homn on Betazed and ask him to transmit a copy as soon as possible. Maybe there's a clue there...
 DATA / Perhaps we are being too literal. In my recent study of dream analysis, I learned that people who appear in a dream can sometimes represent different aspects of the person who is dreaming.
 TROI / That's right... a child might represent vulnerability. Maybe Hedril depicts some fragile part of my mother.
 PICARD / A part that she's protecting... (explaining) ... you said everything you encountered when you were in her mind was a barrier of one kind or another...
 TROI / Yes... you, the wolf, my father... as though she were summoning all her defenses to keep me away.
 TROI / But away from what? What is she protecting?
 TROI / Come in.
 PICARD / (a greeting) Counselor...
 TROI / Hello, Captain.
 PICARD / I've just been in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher feels your mother's condition is deteriorating... her neural functions are getting weaker.
 PICARD / Have you had any luck here?
 TROI / No, nothing. I've gone through her belongings... and read her journal from the last five years... (a bit wry) ... and other than the fact that I'm not married yet, nothing bad seems to have happened to her.
 PICARD / Is this your Father?
 TROI / Yes...
 PICARD / He had a kind face...
 TROI / (nods) I remember when he died, my Mother had to go through all his things and pack them away... I was seven... and I remember thinking that he'd be mad when he came home and saw what she'd done. (beat) I didn't understand that he wasn't coming back...
 PICARD / Deanna... your Mother might still come out of this.
 TROI / If we can't figure out what's wrong with her -- I don't think she will.
 TROI / But I don't know what to do. I've talked with Mister Homn, who's known her for years. I've checked her medical records. I've made enquiries to the government on Betazed and I've contacted several of her close friends. If she suffered some kind of psychic trauma, there's just no evidence of it.
 PICARD / You said you'd reviewed her journals for the past five years. Perhaps we should go further back.
 TROI / There's a lot to review. My mother's kept a journal since she was first married...
 PICARD / Well, let's start at the beginning.
 PICARD / The first entry seems to be Stardate 30620.1.
 TROI / That's the year they were married.
 PICARD / This is odd... there's a seven year gap.
 TROI / It starts about a year after my parents were married...
 PICARD / And if I'm not mistaken, it ends a few months after your birth.
 TROI / My Mother has always been so diligent about her journal -- why would she have stopped making entries for so long?
 PICARD / She didn't. The files were deleted.
 PICARD / (continuing) By your Mother... almost thirty years ago.
 TROI / I don't understand any of this...
 TROI / (continuing) Captain, I have to go back in to my mother's mind. That's the only way we're ever going to get any answers.
 BEVERLY / Deanna... you understand that if your para-cortical readings go too high again, I'll have to tell Maques to sever the connection.
 TROI / I know.
 TROI / Hedril, be careful...
 TROI / Wait! I want to talk to you --
 TROI / (gently) Mother... ?
 TROI / No... I want to help you.
 TROI / (continuing) Why did you delete parts of your journal?
 TROI / (continuing) Did something happen to you -- something you don't want me to know about?
 TROI / Who is Hedril, Mother? Why is she here?
 TROI / (continuing) Is Hedril me -- when I was a little girl?
 TROI / Did you let something happen to someone... ?
 TROI / (continuing) Was it here, at El'nar?
 TROI / Tell me; whatever it is we can face it together.
 TROI / You can... we can.
 TROI / (to herself) Kestra... ?
 TROI / What happened, Mother. What happened next?
 TROI / You have to. You can't hold it back -- it's killing you.
 TROI / You have to forgive yourself, Mother... you have to let go...
 TROI / It was a terrible tragedy -- the worst thing that can happen to any parent... I know you feel responsible... but it was an accident...
 TROI / And what you're doing isn't fair to Kestra...
 TROI / I saw a little girl who was sweet and happy... she must have brought a great deal of joy into your lives...
 TROI / Then isn't it better to remember her like that? (beat) I've just found out I had a sister I never knew... I'd like to remember what was good and joyous about her... to celebrate her life, not mourn it...
 TROI / I know. And you shut it away inside you all these years. But hiding it didn't make it go away. It's still there, hurting you... and it will stay there unless you can forgive yourself and move on.
 TROI / Kestra was here, a few moments ago. Talk to her...
 TROI / Do it. Tell her how you feel. (beat) I'm here with you. I'll help you.
 TROI / She sounds very sweet...
 TROI / If it hadn't been for your work with the Cairn, the strain of the telepathic contact, you might have been able to repress the memory forever.
 TROI / (continuing) I contacted Mister Homn and told him you were all right. He asked me to give you something.
 TROI / Mister Homn said he saved it... in case someday you wanted to remember her...
 TROI / Tell me about her.. I want to know everything.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 47304.2. The Enterprise has arrived at Kesprytt Three in order to evaluate an unusual request on the part of the Kes for associate membership in the Federation.
 PICARD and BEVERLY are seated at the table, finishing / up the last remnants of a large breakfast. The fare this morning consists of some strange-looking soup with the consistency of molasses and plates of exotic fruits. Beverly eats heartily, thoroughly enjoying every bite -- Picard is somewhat restrained... making vague motions at the soup and mostly contenting himself with a cup of tea and a biscuit.
 BEVERLY / She's been very secretive... every time I ask her about it or try to edge around the subject, she changes the subject. Personally, I think she's in love.
 PICARD / Mmmmm.
 BEVERLY / Didn't you hear me? I said, she's in love.
 PICARD / Yes?
 BEVERLY / Is that all you can say?
 PICARD / What would you like me to say? I'm very pleased for them both.
 BEVERLY / Both of who?
 PICARD / The two... people we were discussing.
 BEVERLY / (with a smile) You don't have the slightest idea who I'm talking about, do you?
 PICARD / (laughing) No... no, I'm sorry... but I really don't.
 BEVERLY / (smiling) I'll try not to take that personally... I've been talking about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign Markson for almost fifteen minutes.
 PICARD / Oh, now it hasn't been that long.
 BEVERLY / How would you know? You haven't heard a thing I've said since I got here.
 PICARD / You're right. I'm sorry.
 BEVERLY / Are you worried about this mission with the Kes?
 PICARD / Not worried exactly... just uneasy. This notion of admitting half of their planet to the Federation while leaving the other half out...
 BEVERLY / Well, first of all, the Kes are not half the planet, they're almost three-quarters of it. And the Prytt are not being left out -- they simply don't want any outside contact with the Federation or anyone else.
 PICARD / Every member of the Federation has entered as a unified world... and that unity said something about them... that they had resolved certain social and political problems at home and were ready to join a larger community.
 BEVERLY / From all indications, the Kes are a very unified, very progressive people.
 PICARD / But the Prytt are not. They are reclusive to the point of xenophobia.
 BEVERLY / Think about Earth -- what if one of the old nation-states, say Australia, had decided not to join the World Government in twenty-one fifty? Would that have disqualified us from being a Federation member?
 PICARD / That analogy is not entirely --
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain.
 PICARD / (to com) Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We've received word from Ambassador Mauric that he's ready to see you and Doctor Crusher.
 PICARD / Inform him we're on our way.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 PICARD / Thank you for breakfast.
 BEVERLY / Wait until tomorrow... I have something very special planned. It's a Vulcan dish -- that's all I'll tell you.
 WORF is working at the console along with a N.D. / Crewmember as Beverly and Picard ENTER.
 WORF / Captain. Doctor. I have the coordinates of Ambassador Mauric's chambers.
 PICARD / Let's not keep them waiting, Mister Worf.
 WORF / (to com) Enterprise to Kes Security Relay Station One. We're ready to commence transport.
 WORF / Confirmed.
 PICARD / Energize.
 WORF / (to com) This is the Enterprise. We have completed the transport sequence. You should have them.
 PICARD / Beverly... Beverly...
 BEVERLY / What happened?
 PICARD / I don't know.
 BEVERLY / The last thing I remember... was beginning the transport...
 PICARD / I would assume that we're on Kesprytt... in some kind of prison cell.
 PICARD / (continuing) The question is why? I can't imagine that Ambassador Mauric would --
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / What is it?
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure.
 BEVERLY / It's an implant... looks like it might be connected directly to the brainstem.
 PICARD / Some kind of coercive device... ?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Whatever they are... I doubt they're designed for our health.
 PICARD / Why are we being held?
 BEVERLY / If you tell us why you've taken us hostage, we might be able to --
 PICARD / Prisoners. By whose authority?
 PICARD / The enemy... you mean the Kes.
 PICARD / Your information is in error. There are no plans to enter into any --
 PICARD / And you will discover that we're telling the truth.
 DATA is on the platform, examining a raised section of / the Transporter with a tricorder. Worf and RIKER are standing at the console.
 DATA / There is nothing wrong with the Transporter. I have run a complete diagnostic and checked all the targeting components.
 RIKER / Then what happened to the Captain and Doctor Crusher?
 WORF / Commander. The Transporter sensor log shows an unusual concentration of antigraviton particles in the emitter coil. These particles do not occur naturally -- something must have interfered with the Transporter.
 RIKER / Interfered?
 DATA / A concentration of antigraviton particles would suggest a tractor beam. It might have deflected the Transporter beam to a different set of coordinates.
 RIKER / Is there a way to locate those coordinates?
 DATA / No, sir. (beat) However, it may be possible to determine the point of origin of the tractor beam itself.
 RIKER / Well, that's a start.
 DATA / The tractor beam originated from somewhere within the Prytt Alliance.
 RIKER / The Prytt... things just got a little more complicated. (beat) Can we scan for them?
 DATA / (shakes his head) Prytt territory is shielded by a high-energy forcefield. It cannot be penetrated by our sensors.
 WORF / Why would the Prytt want Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher?
 RIKER / I don't know. And it's not going to be easy to find out... the Prytt have consistently refused all outside contact and somehow I don't think they're going to be eager to start now. We'll have to work through the Kes. (to Worf) Contact Ambassador Mauric and tell him we need a meeting right away.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / What?
 BEVERLY / (confused) What?
 PICARD / You're staring at me.
 BEVERLY / Sorry. I was just wondering how long you were going to keep at this.
 PICARD / (returns to the wall) As long as it takes. With any luck, there may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape.
 BEVERLY / (without conviction) Right.
 PICARD / The important thing during any confinement is to think positively and not to give up hope... there is a way out of every box... there is a solution to every puzzle... it is simply a matter of --
 PICARD / Damn.
 BEVERLY / Well, at least this means we're not going to starve to death.
 PICARD / (grim) What it means is that they plan on keeping us here for a while...
 BEVERLY / I'm starting to think negatively, Jean-Luc.
 BEVERLY / My tricorder!
 PICARD / Does it work?
 BEVERLY / (works) Yes. But something's been added to the main directory.
 PICARD / It's a map...
 BEVERLY / An escape route. That guard must be working for the Kes...
 PICARD / Possibly.
 BEVERLY / What else could it be?
 PICARD / It could be part of a very carefully laid trap.
 BEVERLY / If you ask me, I'd rather take my chances out there.
 PICARD / Agreed. Is there a way to open the cell door?
 BEVERLY / Yes. The code's been entered.
 RIKER / That's very kind, Ambassador. But I don't think anyone here blames you or the Kes government for what's happened.
 TROI / Our primary concern is not to assign blame, but to recover our missing officers.
 RIKER / Ambassador... we haven't even tried a diplomatic effort yet. I'd rather not use force until we've exhausted all other options.
 TROI / Surely you must have some means of communication in case of a planetary emergency.
 WORF / We can determine their communications frequencies and establish a link.
 TROI / How long has it been since your last diplomatic contact?
 TROI / Then it's possible that they've changed over the years.
 RIKER / Mister Ambassador... with all due respect, I feel I should make an attempt to communicate with the Prytt before I sanction the use of force.
 RIKER / Agreed.
 RIKER / (nods) Mister Worf will help you.
 WORF / Is there a problem, Ambassador?
 WORF / I can assure you there is no need.
 WORF / As Security Chief of the Enterprise, I would be glad to assist you in any way possible --
 WORF / Is there a problem, Ambassador?
 WORF / I can assure you there is no need.
 WORF / As Security Chief of the Enterprise, I would be glad to assist you in any way possible --
 PICARD / (re: cave door) Someone obviously put a lot of time and effort into this.
 BEVERLY / It might have been the guard's personal escape route.
 PICARD / You're assuming he's a Kes agent.
 BEVERLY / Seems logical.
 PICARD / There must be a lava flow or a hot spring somewhere near by.
 BEVERLY / (nods, off tricorder) It's a lava flow... about thirty meters beneath us. (beat) We're supposed to head this way.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I smell gas...
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) This whole chamber is filled with pockets of a methanogenic compound...
 PICARD / Can we get through it?
 BEVERLY / I think so...
 PICARD / What did you say?
 BEVERLY / I didn't say anything. (off tricorder) There seems to be a fairly regular pattern to these eruptions... if we're careful we should be able to navigate through them.
 PICARD / Say when...
 BEVERLY / Now...
 PICARD / The eruptions have stopped...
 BEVERLY / (scanning behind them) The gas is building up!
 DATA / I have scanned the entire Prytt communications system and I believe this is the primary access module for the central government.
 RIKER / Can you determine which of these com links is connected to their prime minister's office?
 DATA / I believe so. However, the Prytt have no link designed for extraterritorial communications. Our hail may come as a surprise to them.
 RIKER / Well, they're going to have to adjust. Open a channel.
 RIKER / This is Commander William T. Riker of the Federation starship Enterprise. I know this is an unusual way to --
 RIKER / That's right.
 RIKER / Well, we didn't know how to contact your government directly, so we had to start somewhere. Now if I could talk with your--
 RIKER / No. As I said, we didn't know how to contact you so--
 RIKER / Not very friendly are they?
 DATA / No, sir.
 WORF / Sir. We are being hailed... it is the Prytt Security Council.
 RIKER / Looks like we got somebody's attention. On screen.
 RIKER / Minister, we've been trying to contact someone in your government. It appears that you've detained two of our officers and we would like to discuss this situation.
 WORF / Their weapon systems pose no threat to the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Just the same, let's keep the shields up for the time being.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Our efforts with the Prytt just ran into a wall.
 RIKER / (shocked) What?
 WORF / Where are they now?
 RIKER / How do you plan to get them across the border?
 RIKER / Ambassador... I'm afraid I must insist that you provide us with more information.
 RIKER / Certainly. We can step into the Ready Room.
 RIKER / All right.
 PICARD / There's no way out of here...
 BEVERLY / Maybe we took a wrong turn...
 BEVERLY / (without looking up) Me too...
 PICARD / (puzzled) What?
 BEVERLY / I'm thirsty too.
 PICARD / I didn't say anything about being thirsty.
 BEVERLY / I heard you. You said, "I'm very thirsty."
 PICARD / I was thinking about it, but I didn't say anything.
 BEVERLY / You were thinking it...
 PICARD / (touches implant) The transceivers. Lorin said they would align themselves to our psi wave patterns...
 BEVERLY / The implants might be transmitting our thoughts. (beat) What am I thinking?
 PICARD / I don't know.
 BEVERLY / I can't hear your thoughts, either. Maybe it was just a fluke.
 PICARD / (nods) For now, I'm afraid we have more immediate concerns. Does the map indicate a way out of here?
 BEVERLY / Yes. We go up.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) There's a ledge about thirty meters up that connects to another tunnel which should lead to the surface.
 PICARD / Right.
 PICARD / (continuing) I heard that. (off her look) They weren't words exactly... I suddenly had this... sense of fear... a fear of heights.
 BEVERLY / So much for it being a fluke.
 PICARD / What a strange sensation... your thoughts just appeared in my mind.
 BEVERLY / If you sensed fear of heights, you sensed pretty accurately.
 PICARD / Come on. We've done this before... it's just like on the Holodeck. (takes her hand and puts it on rock) One hand-hold at a time... nothing too fast... just a slow, gentle climb.
 BEVERLY / (deep breath) Right.
 RIKER / I see you've done some redecorating.
 RIKER / Certainly.
 RIKER / Ambassador... how do you plan to get my people out of Prytt territory?
 RIKER / You've recruited a few Prytt spies.
 RIKER / Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it wise to send two human fugitives in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt village?
 RIKER / I'd still feel better if they could rendezvous with your operatives in a less public place.
 PICARD / One of us is hungry.
 BEVERLY / That would be me.
 PICARD / Try to think of something else. You're making me hungry.
 BEVERLY / What would you like me to think about?
 PICARD / Something other than a large bowl of vegetable soup.
 BEVERLY / (with relish) My grandmother used to make it... with beans and peas and carrots --
 PICARD / Beverly.
 BEVERLY / Sorry.
 PICARD / (having "heard" her) I am not being unreasonable.
 BEVERLY / I didn't say you were. I may have thought it, but there's a difference.
 PICARD / You're right. We can't react to every random thought that crosses the other person's mind. (beat) It's astonishing how much... clutter there is in our consciousness. Odd memories coming to the surface... bits of half-remembered songs...
 BEVERLY / (nods) Stray day-dreams... scattered minutiae... I wonder how true telepaths sift through it all. How can they get to what someone's really thinking if their minds are constantly churning all this flotsam to the surface?
 BEVERLY / That is not funny.
 PICARD / (lightly) I just wanted to see if you were listening.
 BEVERLY / I think the link is getting stronger.
 PICARD / (nods) Maybe we should put some distance between us... that might weaken it. (wry) Not that I'm tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts...
 BEVERLY / Certainly not.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc...
 PICARD / What happened?
 BEVERLY / I don't know... I suddenly felt a wave of nausea.
 PICARD / Me too.
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) I don't see anything wrong with either of us. (beat) Maybe the air is toxic...
 PICARD / The same thing... but when you moved back toward me... I felt better.
 PICARD / It would seem we're stuck with each other.
 PICARD / What's wrong?
 BEVERLY / I can't tell if we're supposed to go over this hill... or that one. The topography on this map is a little vague.
 PICARD / Let me see.
 PICARD / (continuing, confidently) This way.
 BEVERLY / You don't really know, do you?
 PICARD / What?
 BEVERLY / You're acting like you know exactly which way to go... but you're just guessing. Do you do this all the time?
 PICARD / No. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) But... there are times when it's important for a Captain to give the appearance of confidence.
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I couldn't resist...
 PICARD / I'm beginning to realize that you seem to always have some... acerbic remark on the tip of your tongue.
 BEVERLY / At least I've trained myself not to say it anymore. When I was a little girl, my mouth was always landing me in trouble with my parents... my teachers...
 PICARD / (reading her thoughts) Your friends... and someone named Tom Norris... ?
 BEVERLY / (smiles) That's right. We had one date... which I brought to an abrupt halt with the words... "Is that a beard or is your face dirty?"
 PICARD / (overlapping) "Or is your face dirty?"
 PICARD / There's something more... you're laughing, but... (surprised) You actually feel... embarrassed about that incident.
 BEVERLY / (a little sad) Yes. (beat) I thought I was being cute... but I really hurt him.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) That was a long time ago. And it taught me a valuable lesson.
 PICARD / (shakes his head) This... sharing of thoughts and feelings... it's compelling in a strange way...
 BEVERLY / Very. (beat) We'd better get going.
 BEVERLY / (quietly) I don't think so, either. Maybe there's another way to reach the village.
 PICARD / No. We'd have to backtrack several kilometers to find another way over this ridge.
 PICARD / (off tricorder) The border's only two kilometers east of here... there's a forcefield protecting it, but we'll have to find a way to deal with that when we get there.
 RIKER / (to Mauric) Is something wrong?
 RIKER / Do you know what happened to them?
 WORF / It is possible they have been recaptured.
 RIKER / A different rendezvous? I'm not sure what you mean.
 RIKER / What?
 RIKER / This is ridiculous. You're starting to see conspiracies everywhere. We were invited here by the Kes, why would we want to ally ourselves with the Prytt?
 RIKER / You can believe what you want... we're going to find our people with or without your help.
 RIKER / (re: equipment) Just make sure you take all that junk with you.
 PICARD / No luck.
 BEVERLY / I'm beginning to think there's not a single thing on this planet we can eat.
 PICARD / Well... if we're lucky, we'll be back on the Enterprise by this time tomorrow and you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife and fork.
 BEVERLY / Remember that Vulcan dish I promised you for breakfast? I was just thinking...
 BEVERLY / (continuing, surprised) You hate having breakfast with me.
 PICARD / That's not true.
 BEVERLY / Yes, it is. As soon as I said, "breakfast" I heard you say, "I hate that."
 PICARD / That's not quite what I meant...
 BEVERLY / Well, what did you mean?
 PICARD / I simply... don't like...
 BEVERLY / ("hearing" him) ... don't like what I've been choosing for breakfast.
 PICARD / No, no. It's... just that I feel breakfast should be... a simple meal... and recently they seem to have become more elaborate.
 BEVERLY / ("hearing" him) Tea and scones. That's all you really want, isn't it? Tea and scones. Why didn't you say so?
 PICARD / It didn't seem that important...
 PICARD / (continuing) You don't like those elaborate meals either.
 BEVERLY / (laughs) I usually prefer something simple myself... but somehow I thought you might enjoy more variety.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Well, it's tea and scones for both of us from now on.
 PICARD / (continuing) I love firelight.
 BEVERLY / (overlapping) I love firelight.
 PICARD / There's something about the flame... the smell of the smoke... I've always felt it's intoxicating in a way...
 BEVERLY / (smiles) I remember when Jack and I took Wesley on his first camping trip to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept throwing manta leaves in the fire to watch them pop... Jack kept telling him...
 BEVERLY / What?
 BEVERLY / (continuing, gently) Jean-Luc... I heard you. Don't push it away.
 PICARD / Beverly, please. I don't want to talk about this right now.
 BEVERLY / When I said, "Jack and I"... I could feel this sudden wave of... something. (beat, then surprised) I never knew you felt that way.
 PICARD / Didn't you?
 BEVERLY / I guess I always knew there was... an attraction between us, right from the start. But I had no idea how strongly you felt... (beat) Why didn't you ever tell me you were in love with me?
 PICARD / You were married to my best friend. (beat) At first, it seemed like a harmless infatuation... something more hormonal than emotional. But then...
 BEVERLY / ("hearing" more) But then as the months went by... and the three of us starting spending more time together...
 PICARD / I began to realize that it was something more. (beat) It wasn't right... and I knew I wouldn't act on it... but I couldn't help the way I felt.
 BEVERLY / ("hearing" more) And when Jack died... you felt guilty.
 PICARD / I felt guilty before he died... having those kind of feelings for my best friend's wife. Then... later, after the accident... I told myself that no matter what happened I would never let you know how I felt.
 BEVERLY / You didn't want to feel as if you were...
 PICARD / Betraying my friend...
 BEVERLY / That's why you didn't want me on the Enterprise seven years ago.
 PICARD / I didn't know how I would react. (beat) But gradually, I found that I didn't feel that way anymore... that twenty years was indeed a long time...
 BEVERLY / And now we're friends...
 PICARD / Yes... friends.
 BEVERLY / We still have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow. We should get some sleep.
 PICARD / Right.
 RIKER / Ambassador. Thank you for coming.
 RIKER / We're about to clear up this misunderstanding once and for all. (to Worf) Hail Minister Lorin, please.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / Yes, I know. But I think it's about time we all sat down together and tried to work this out. I have Ambassador Mauric here and --
 RIKER / We'll see. (to Worf) Mister Worf...
 RIKER / (to Mauric) I think there's someone waiting for us in the Observation Lounge.
 RIKER / I'm sorry I had to resort to these drastic measures, Minister, but you left me little choice.
 RIKER / Let's all just sit down and try to talk about what's happened to Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher.
 RIKER / All right... then we'll stand. The important thing is that we start talking.
 RIKER / Then talk to me. Where are my officers?
 PICARD / I'm all right.
 RIKER / (hard) That's it.
 RIKER / (continuing) I can see that... diplomacy is not going to get us anywhere today, and I don't have time for an extended negotiation session. So it's time to lay all the cards on the table.
 RIKER / (continuing) That means it's time to stop fooling around and get serious. (to Lorin) You're concerned that the Kes are about to be admitted into an associative membership with the Federation.
 RIKER / As First Officer of the Enterprise I think I can promise you that is not going to happen. The Kes will be denied membership.
 RIKER / They will listen to the report of the Enterprise Captain and his First Officer. And I can tell you right now that the First Officer's report will go something like this: (he moves about the room) "Kesprytt is a deeply troubled world with social, political, and military problems that it has yet to resolve. The Kes, although a friendly and democratic people, are driven by suspicion, deviousness, and paranoia. In the opinion of this officer, they are not ready for membership."
 RIKER / Now to the matter of our missing officers...
 RIKER / Then maybe you should consider this: If anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. That means more starships will be sent to Kesprytt... and those ships are going to want answers... which means they'll be putting your country under a very large and very uncomfortable microscope.
 RIKER / (continuing) Remember how unhappy you were when we contacted just one of your people without authorization? Well, think of what it'll be like when ten starships start looking for answers. They'll be contacting hundreds of your people... they'll conduct massive sensor sweeps... they might even start sending down Away Teams. And all because you wouldn't help me find my missing officers...
 BEVERLY / I think I can use the tricorder to set-up a multiphase pulse. That should weaken the field enough for us to get through.
 PICARD / No, no. The modulation frequency should be in the upper-harmonic range.
 BEVERLY / Right.
 BEVERLY / I'm going as fast as I can.
 RIKER / Thank you, Minister. Now, if you'll excuse me...
 RIKER / Mauric is determined to take his protest to the Federation Council, but I don't think he'll get very far.
 PICARD / I tend to agree, Number One.
 RIKER / Did I miss something?
 PICARD / (to Beverly) I know... I know... you're absolutely right.
 BEVERLY / (re: food) That was wonderful.
 PICARD / My pleasure.
 BEVERLY / Don't take this the wrong way, Jean-Luc... but I'm glad we're not joined at the hip anymore.
 PICARD / Were you getting tired of my company?
 BEVERLY / Just tired of bumping into you every thirty seconds. I was beginning to feel like you were part of my uniform.
 BEVERLY / Champagne... ?
 BEVERLY / (lifts her glass) What shall we drink to?
 PICARD / Our... freedom.
 BEVERLY / Freedom.
 BEVERLY / Penny for your thoughts.
 PICARD / I was just thinking... that as distracting as it was... I was beginning to get used to... "hearing" your thoughts.
 BEVERLY / So was I. It was very... intimate.
 BEVERLY / You know... last night... I woke up...
 PICARD / Oh?
 BEVERLY / I was awake for several hours. And thanks to the implant, I got to "hear" some very interesting dreams of yours.
 PICARD / A man can't be held responsible for what his mind does when he's asleep.
 BEVERLY / What about when he's awake?
 PICARD / So now that we've had this... unique experience... what do we do now?
 BEVERLY / (innocent) What do you mean?
 PICARD / You know exactly what I mean.
 BEVERLY / No I don't. The implant's been removed, remember?
 PICARD / I mean now that we know how we each feel... perhaps we shouldn't be afraid to explore those feelings...
 BEVERLY / (gently) I'm not afraid... but I'm also not ready.
 BEVERLY / Good-night.
 PICARD / Good-night.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / (harried) Come in!
 DATA / Geordi... ?
 GEORDI (O.S.) / I'm in here...
 GEORDI / I've got her now, Data... she's trapped.
 DATA / (puzzled) Who?
 GEORDI / Your demented cat.
 DATA / I do not understand. Why is Spot under the bed?
 GEORDI / Probably because she knows I'll kill her if I get my hands on her.
 DATA / Has Spot been misbehaving?
 GEORDI / That's putting it mildly. So far she's broken a vase and a teapot, destroyed my couch by using it as a scratching post, and coughed up hairballs on my carpet.
 DATA / These incidents are common to cat owners. When you borrowed Spot, you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behavior before getting a cat yourself.
 GEORDI / Yeah, well, I don't think I'm ready for one. You can take her back, with my blessings.
 GEORDI / Well? Go ahead -- call her.
 DATA / Spot does not respond to verbal commands.
 GEORDI / She won't come when you call her?
 DATA / No.
 GEORDI / Data, have you ever considered training her?
 DATA / (pondering) I have never found it to be necessary.
 GEORDI / Necessary? That cat is out of control. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / Half the time I wasn't sure if she was going to lick me or scratch my face off.
 DATA / I have never experienced that kind of behavior from Spot. (beat) Although she does have the unfortunate habit of jumping onto my computer console when I am working.
 GEORDI / There, see? She needs training.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to senior staff. Please report to the observation lounge. Mission briefing in ten minutes.
 GEORDI / Okay, we have to get her out from under there. I'll scare her -- you grab her when she comes out.
 DATA / I do not think it would be wise to startle her --
 GEORDI / Now!
 GEORDI / Uh-oh...
 GEORDI / Training. (beat) Definitely.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47310.2. We are investigating the disappearance of the Medical Transport Fleming somewhere in the Hekaras Corridor. Our search is complicated by the unique properties of this particular region of space.
 PICARD, RIKER, Data, TROI, BEVERLY, WORF, and Geordi / are seated at the conference table. The mood is upbeat -- even though the mission is serious, it's still fairly routine.
 RIKER / The Fleming's last contact with Starfleet was four days ago. They didn't report anything out of the ordinary when they entered the Corridor...
 DATA / The unusually intense tetryon fields in this sector pose a severe navigational hazard to warpdriven vessels...
 DATA / (continuing) The Hekaras Corridor is the only route through the area which is free of tetryon fields. Ships travelling at warp must use the Corridor to ensure safe passage through the region.
 PICARD / How long will it take to complete a level-one search?
 DATA / At least two days, sir. The Corridor is over twelve lightyears long, and the surrounding tetryon interference will limit our sensor range.
 WORF / Could we send out reconnaissance probes to supplement the sensors?
 GEORDI / They won't be very effective. The interference will make it difficult to maintain contact with the probes; the best we can do is to try increasing the sensor efficiency. (beat; to Picard) We're installing multi-phase buffers on all the sensor modules. It should help a little.
 TROI / Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't it? Maybe they've had contact with the Fleming.
 RIKER / They haven't. I've already spoken with the Hekaran government. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / According to them, only one ship has passed through their system in the last week... and that was a Ferengi trader.
 BEVERLY / The Fleming was carrying a supply of bio-mimetic gel... it's rare and quite valuable. Do you think it's possible the Ferengi could have hijacked it?
 RIKER / (considers) I wouldn't put it past them. (beat; to Picard) We should be prepared for that contingency.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 PICARD / (continuing) All right then. Mister Worf, initiate your search pattern. Let's head in.
 DATA / Geordi, we have experienced a slight drop in sensor efficiency. Commander Riker would like us to examine the phase buffers.
 GEORDI / No problem, Data... I'll be with you in a minute...
 GEORDI / (continuing) All right, Hansen, transfer EPS conduit thirteen through the stabilizer matrix.
 DATA / Geordi, is there a problem with the engines?
 GEORDI / No, not really...
 DATA / Then why are you stabilizing the EPS conduit?
 GEORDI / I'm just trying to get a slightly higher power conversion level...
 DATA / (considering it) That would not affect the engines in any way.
 GEORDI / I know. That's not the point.
 DATA / Then... what is "the point?"
 GEORDI / (a bit evasive) I just... want the best conversion level I can get.
 DATA / Why?
 GEORDI / It's the Intrepid. (off Data's reaction) Their Chief Engineer is Commander Donald Kaplan. We went through the Academy together. And... I kind of like to make sure our power conversion level is... a little higher than theirs.
 DATA / I understand. You are in competition with Mister Kaplan.
 GEORDI / No, it's not really a competition... (beat) This is the flagship. It just seems to me -- we should be better than the rest.
 DATA / That does sound like a competitive position.
 GEORDI / It's more a matter of personal pride. I mean... these are my engines.
 DATA / But you are trying to outperform the Intrepid.
 GEORDI / Well... yeah.
 GEORDI / Computer. How much have the conversion levels increased?
 GEORDI / All right, we'll deal with of this later...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Let's take a look at those sensors.
 GEORDI / Okay -- how's that?
 DATA / The phase buffer is functioning within normal parameters. Sensor efficiency has increased six-point-seven percent.
 GEORDI / Only six-point-seven? One of the stages must still be out of alignment... (beat) Let's check out junction A-nine.
 DATA / Geordi, I have taken your suggestion regarding Spot.
 GEORDI / What suggestion?
 DATA / I have begun to train her. I am currently testing several techniques.
 GEORDI / Really...
 DATA / I began with simple conditioned response exercises and followed with various environmental enhancements. Next I intend to explore bio-conditioning devices.
 GEORDI / Devices?
 DATA / Such as sensor nets for behavior modification... or bio-feedback motivators... (beat) Unfortunately, I have been largely unsuccessful...
 GEORDI / (kidding) How about a phaser? A low stun setting at the right moment might do the trick...
 DATA / Geordi. I will not stun my cat.
 GEORDI / I was just kidding...
 GEORDI / This isn't it, either.
 DATA / There is clearly a misalignment somewhere in this system.
 GEORDI / That's for sure... (thinks) There's one more possibility... let's take a look at junction C-twelve...
 DATA / I am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimately fail...
 GEORDI / Well, maybe you're just going about it the wrong way.
 DATA / I have consulted numerous animal behavior manuals; several of them claim that cats are inherently untrainable.
 GEORDI / I don't believe that. My sister didn't know a thing about animals and she was able to train her cat. How complicated could it be?
 DATA / (curious) What did she train her cat to do?
 GEORDI / (thinks about it) Well... her cat would jump into her arms on command.
 DATA / That is interesting. Perhaps I could modify your sister's technique to keep Spot off my console. Do you know how she was able to train her cat?
 GEORDI / (amused) Well, as I recall, she had to walk around for about two months with a piece of tuna in her blouse...
 GEORDI / I was right... this buffer is out of alignment... (beat, works) All right... how's that?
 DATA / The phase alignment is stabilizing... (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (beat) However, sensor efficiency has only increased an additional one-point-three percent.
 GEORDI / Well, that's not much, but every little bit helps.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Data.
 DATA / (taps combadge) Data here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / We're picking up a ship ahead on long range sensors. If you and Geordi are through down there, we'd like to have you on the Bridge.
 GEORDI / We've squeezed as much out of these systems as we're going to get.
 DATA / (to com) Acknowledged, sir. We are on our way.
 WORF / We are within visual range, sir.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / (to Picard) This is the same Ferengi ship that entered the Corridor a week ago. (MORE)
 GEORDI / Captain, there are no emissions from their plasma vents. Their warp drive must be completely inactive.
 DATA / (off console) That is correct, sir. Their impulse systems appear to be down as well... power generation is at extremely low levels.
 PICARD / What about life signs?
 DATA / (off console) Life support is also functioning, at low levels. There are approximately four-hundred fifty Ferengi on board. That is a standard complement for a vessel of this class.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency.
 WORF / No response on any channel, sir.
 GEORDI / (off console) I'm not reading any subspace emissions from their ship at all, sir. It looks like every one of their field coils has been overloaded.
 RIKER / That would explain why they didn't respond to our hails...
 DATA / It would also explain the failure of their warp drive.
 GEORDI / Sir, the Feregni sensors are still functioning. I could modify one of our deflector emitters to transmit old-style delta waves... if I modulate that with a com signal, the Ferengi should be able to pick it up.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Well, if they did hijack the Fleming, they certainly didn't get very far with the cargo.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, have tractor beams standing by... we may have to take them under tow... (beat) Helm, bring us within tractor range...
 WORF / (puzzled, off console) Captain, I am picking up power emissions from the Ferengi ship... (urgently) They are locking weapons!
 PICARD / (quickly) Raise shields --
 RIKER / Ready phasers. Prepare to return fire.
 PICARD / Target their weapons array only.
 WORF / Phasers locked.
 PICARD / Fire.
 DATA / Direct hit. (beat) Their weapon systems are down.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Damage report.
 WORF / (off console) We sustained minimal damage on decks five and seven, sir.
 DATA / Sir, the Ferengi ship's power has stabilized... they appear to have impulse capability.
 RIKER / (to Picard) They were just playing dead... conserving power until we got in close enough.
 PICARD / But why attack us in the first place?
 RIKER / Somehow I don't think they're going to let us beam over and ask them...
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, how are you coming with that com link?
 GEORDI / Almost ready, sir...
 GEORDI / (continuing) We can give it a try.
 PICARD / Open a channel.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Please explain your attack on my ship.
 PICARD / Your ship was adrift and your communications inoperative. We were attempting to ascertain your status.
 PICARD / Daimon, there has clearly been a misunderstanding here. I believe it would be in everyone's best interests if you came aboard and we discussed the situation.
 PICARD / Then I suppose we'll be on our way... (beat) If you wish, I'll relay your position to your government... in case you're unable to complete repairs... and remain stranded here.
 PICARD / Daimon Prak. The Federation established this Corridor to ensure a safe route through the sector. We have nothing to gain from mining it.
 RIKER / Whatever happened to your ship may not be an isolated incident. A Federation Medical transport was recently lost in the Corridor.
 RIKER / Can you give us an idea of their heading?
 PICARD / Perhaps if we assigned an engineering team to assist with the repair efforts... would that give you time to retrieve your logs?
 DATA / Spot -- down.
 DATA / (continuing) Spot -- down.
 DATA / (continuing) Spot -- down.
 DATA / (continuing) This is up. Up is no.
 DATA / (continuing) This is down. (strokes Spot) Down is good.
 DATA / (continuing) Come in.
 GEORDI / Data. I had another idea that might help boost our power conversion levels. Could you give me a hand?
 DATA / I would be happy to.
 GEORDI / Don't tell me you're training her to use the console.
 DATA / As part of her training program, I am teaching Spot to jump down from the desk on my command.
 GEORDI / How's it going?
 DATA / I have not been entirely successful...
 DATA / (continuing) Feline supplement two-hundred twenty-one.
 GEORDI / That cat has definitely got a mind of her own, Data. Maybe she's just not trainable.
 DATA / I suppose I must accept that possibility. It may be that Spot lacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses to my commands.
 GEORDI / Maybe. (beat) But I think your training is coming along quite nicely.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Come on, Data, let's go.
 GEORDI / Okay, Data, keep the EPS flow constant while I re-modulate the power taps.
 DATA / This procedure could only boost the conversion level by -- point-eight percent.
 GEORDI / That's all right... it might be enough.
 DATA / Enough?
 GEORDI / Commander Kaplan just sent me this on subspace.
 DATA / "La Forge. I've got Intrepid's power conversion level up to ninety-seven-point-one percent. Maybe you should try cleaning your plasma grid once in a while."
 GEORDI / Can you believe the nerve of this guy... ?
 DATA / We perform maintenance on the plasma grid at regular intervals.
 GEORDI / Of course we do -- he's just trying to get me angry.
 GEORDI / That should do it... (to computer) Computer, what is the current power conversion level?
 GEORDI / Too bad, Mister Kaplan...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate, 47311.4. Based on the Ferengi sensor logs, we have traced the Fleming's most likely course. It now appears that the vessel may have come to an unfortunate end.
 PICARD / What's the origin of this debris field?
 DATA / Unknown, sir. It does not appear on any Federation charts of the Corridor.
 PICARD / Could it be what's left of the Fleming?
 DATA / It is a possibility. The debris consists primarily of duranium and poly-composite fragments which suggests it could be from a ship. Furthermore, the field contains sufficient mass to account for the Fleming.
 PICARD / All right... let's take a closer look. Perhaps we can find something to give us a positive identification.
 PICARD / (continuing) Helm, plot a course through the debris field. Ahead slow.
 DATA / Captain, I am picking up a small, metallic object, approximately three-point-five meters in diameter...
 RIKER / It could be a ship's log recorder... or a probe casing.
 DATA / (off console) I do not believe so... it is emitting an unusual signal ... (urgently) Sir, it is beginning to generate a verteron field.
 PICARD / Shields up! Full reverse, now!
 PICARD / (continuing, to Worf) Damage report.
 WORF / Warp engines are off-line... shields are down... all subspace systems are inoperative...
 RIKER / Just like the Ferengi ship.
 DATA / Captain, there is an unidentified vessel heading toward us... two life forms aboard...
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / (off console) They are initiating their Transporter systems...
 PICARD / (to Worf) Can you get any power to the shields?
 WORF / No sir.
 RIKER / (to com) All decks... security alert!
 DATA / We are being boarded...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Bridge... we've got intruders in Main Engineering...
 GEORDI / (continuing, to com) We need a security team down here...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / It's on the way...
 GEORDI / What do you want?
 PICARD / (hard, to Rabal) You've made a very serious accusation. I want you to explain it.
 GEORDI / Captain, I've heard this theory before. Their research was evaluated by the Federation Science Council a few years ago. Their claims just didn't hold up.
 PICARD / Doctor, if you wanted us to review your research, you could have placed a request through the Science Council.
 RIKER / That's how you rationalize these attacks?
 RIKER / You can call it whatever you like. The fact remains that you deliberately disguised your probes. You made them look like signal markers... You hid them in debris fields... You mined the Corridor.
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister La Forge, how long do you estimate it will take to restore the engines?
 GEORDI / Their verteron pulse overloaded our field coils, sir... it'll take at least thirty-six hours to get underway.
 PICARD / Because of the seriousness of your claims, I'm willing to listen to your case. But make no mistake. Our priority here is the recovery of the Fleming. (beat) I expect you to help us restore our systems and deactivate all your remaining probes in the Corridor... (beat) If you do not, I will put you both in the brig and take you to the nearest Starbase where you'll face charges for what you've done.
 PICARD / We will, Doctor. Part of our job is to maintain an open mind... even under these circumstances. (beat) Mister La Forge, take them to Engineering and get the core back on-line.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data, begin a review of their research. I'd like your report as soon as possible.
 GEORDI / (irritated) You know, even after we get the engines on-line, it's going to take a week to recalibrate them properly...
 GEORDI / What if the Fleming had been transporting perishable supplies... or was on an emergency mission? Your little plan might have cost a lot of lives.
 GEORDI / Well, you have an interesting way of going about it.
 GEORDI / I'd have to agree with that...
 GEORDI / Warp drive has been around for three centuries. It's a proven technology...
 GEORDI / You mean you didn't believe her, either?
 GEORDI / Well, our Commander Data is no slouch. If there's anything there, he'll find it.
 GEORDI / Hekaras Two is the only inhabited world in this region. Without warp drive, you'd be completely isolated from the rest of the Federation. Are you really willing to take that step?
 DATA / According to Serova and Rabal's theory, there are regions of potential subspace instability within the Corridor...
 DATA / (continuing) They believe that if these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy, they will rupture -- subspace will extrude into normal space, forming a rift.
 PICARD / I see. It's like pacing up and down on a carpet... eventually, you wear a hole in it.
 DATA / The analogy is essentially correct.
 PICARD / Can their theory be proven?
 DATA / At this time, there is insufficient evidence to do so...
 DATA / (continuing) In order to determine whether or not a rift would form, we would have to expose a region of the Corridor to warp field energy approximately one-million times greater than that normally generated by a starship.
 DATA / I agree that is a possibility. (to Picard) Captain, I suggest we ask the Federation Science Council to send a research vessel to this area. A more detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Captain Picard.
 PICARD / (taps combadge) Go ahead.
 RIKER / Sir, we've located the Fleming on long-range sensors, approximately zero-point-three light years away.
 PICARD / What's their condition?
 RIKER / The vessel appears to be intact. They have shields, but it looks like their subspace systems are out.
 PICARD / All right. We'll get underway as soon as the engines are back on-line.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I'd like you all to put together a research proposal for the Science Council. I'll give it my full recommendation.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) The engines are back on-line, sir. All systems are ready.
 PICARD / Very good.
 PICARD / (to conn) Helm, lay in a course for the Fleming.
 RIKER / (to Picard) It looks like they're in pretty good condition. According to our sensors, they've got their shields back up to full strength.
 WORF / (interrupts, off console) Captain, the Hekaran ship is moving off....
 WORF / There is one life form on board. It is Serova.
 PICARD / What's going on, Doctor?
 PICARD / (nods) Mister Worf, open a channel.
 DATA / (off console) Captain, the Hekaran ship's engines are beginning to overload... (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / (beat) I believe Serova is attempting to create a warp core breach...
 RIKER / Shields at maximum... Full reverse...
 PICARD / Report!
 DATA / (off console) We have cleared the shock wave, sir... but tetryon flux in the area is increasing rapidly...
 RIKER / It's incredible...
 PICARD / (to Data) Mister Data, what's your analysis?
 DATA / (off console) The effect is approximately zero-point-one light years in diameter, and is emitting extremely high levels of tetryon radiation... (beat) It appears to be what Rabal and Serova predicted, sir -- a subspace rift.
 GEORDI / She was right...
 PICARD / (to Data) Can you get a fix on the Fleming? Is it still in one piece?
 DATA / (works console) Scanning... (beat) The Fleming is near its previous coordinates... it appears to be intact.... but it is now within the rift.
 PICARD / Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there?
 PICARD / Doctor...
 PICARD / (continuing) I'm sorry about your loss... but we need your help now.
 PICARD / Does the rift pose any danger to the Fleming?
 RIKER / What was that?
 GEORDI / Some kind of high energy distortion wave... it looks like they're being generated from within the rift.
 DATA / As long as we maintain our current position, our shields should provide sufficient protection.
 PICARD / What about the Fleming? How long can they survive in there?
 DATA / The waves are even more intense within the rift. I estimate their shields will fail within twelve hours.
 RIKER / Can we risk going in there to get them out?
 GEORDI / Not at warp, sir. (off console) According to these readings, the rift is in a state of accelerating instability -- which would make it extremely sensitive to warp field energy. If we go in at warp, we might make it expand even further.
 RIKER / I don't think we have a choice. It would take weeks to reach them at impulse.
 PICARD / Then I want some better options. (beat) Data, Geordi... take Doctor Rabal and begin an analysis of the rift. We need a way to get the Fleming out of there.
 DATA (V.O.) / Science Officer's log, Stardate 47312.1. Our new sensor readings have greatly improved our understanding of the rift. However, we have been unable to find any way to counteract it.
 GEORDI / (frustrated) Everything here supports Serova's theories... I don't see any way to close the rift or even reduce its size.
 DATA / Doctor, is it possible there are areas inside the rift which are stable... where we could safely use our warp engines?
 GEORDI / There's something strange here... (beat) Computer. Display grid delta-seventeen... enhance and magnify.
 GEORDI / What do you make of that?
 DATA / That should not be possible.
 GEORDI / In the meantime, we'll have to tell the Captain that we don't know how to get to the Fleming.
 DATA / I am not certain that is true. (off their reactions) I may have an idea.
 DATA / I suggest we coast into the rift.
 RIKER / Coast?
 DATA / We can initiate a brief, high-intensity warp pulse from our current position. We should be able to attain sufficient velocity to enter the rift, beam the crew off the Fleming and exit -- without using our warp engines.
 RIKER / All right. Let's say we initiate a full power warp pulse... how much time will we have before we drop out of warp?
 DATA / If we field-saturate the nacelles, we should be able to sustain warp speed for approximately two minutes.
 RIKER / That's not much time... and it could get pretty rough in there.
 DATA / Our timing will be critical.
 PICARD / Mister Data, begin your calculations. We'll go in as soon as you're ready.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / I believe the maximum saturation level should be eighteen-point-three percent.
 GEORDI / (works console) All right... (off console) With these parameters, we should be able to maintain warp speed for... two minutes and eight seconds. (beat) I don't think we can get any more than that.
 DATA / I agree. But based on the size of the rift, it should give us sufficient time to complete our rescue. (to computer) Computer. Begin nacelle field saturation.
 GEORDI / How did we miss it?
 DATA / What do you mean?
 GEORDI / How did we miss the connection -- between warp drive and the formation of the rift?
 GEORDI / Between the two of us we've logged thousands of hours on these engines. We're supposed to be warp field experts. But this time we certainly were wrong.
 DATA / Technically, Geordi, we were not wrong. Serova's theories rested on assumptions which were unprovable.
 GEORDI / Seems to me she managed to prove them pretty conclusively...
 DATA / But only by using methods which a reputable scientist would never employ.
 GEORDI / Yeah... she was willing to die to make her point. (beat) We should have listened to her more closely.
 DATA / We reviewed Serova's research to the best of our ability, and we were prepared to continue studying the problem. But that was not satisfactory.
 GEORDI / I can remember times when I've been a little stubborn... trying to get people to believe me when I didn't have enough proof...
 DATA / I do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes.
 GEORDI / But she had to... to make us listen. Why? Why was I so resistant?
 DATA / Perhaps because the aggressive methods she chose created an adversarial situation.
 GEORDI / Or maybe I was taking the whole thing personally.
 DATA / I do not understand...
 GEORDI / Maybe it was all a little threatening to me... the thought that warp engines might be doing some kind of damage.
 GEORDI / I've always looked at this warp core as something... beautiful... (beat) It never occurred to me that it might be -- destructive.
 GEORDI / (checks console) It's going to take another half hour for the nacelles to saturate. Would you call me when they're ready? (beat) There's someone I should talk to.
 GEORDI / May I join you?
 GEORDI / I wanted to say... I'm sorry about your sister.
 GEORDI / I wish things could've happened differently. I should have taken a closer look at your research... it's possible there was something I missed...
 GEORDI / I guess the question now is... where do we go from here?
 GEORDI / I've been in Starfleet for a long time. We depend on warp drive... (beat) I don't know how easy it'll be to change.
 DATA / (works console) Captain, warp pulse calculations are complete. We will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for six-point-three seconds before disengaging.
 WORF / Damage control parties are standing-by on all decks.
 RIKER / Our course to the Fleming is plotted and laid in, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) Mister La Forge... whenever you're ready...
 GEORDI / Aye-aye, sir. (works panel) Initiating warp pulse... now.
 DATA / Engines disengaged... (beat) We are entering the rift...
 DATA / (continuing) Hull stress is increasing... eighteen percent of maximum tolerance and rising...
 PICARD / How long until we reach the Fleming?
 WORF / (off console) One minute, twenty-two seconds...
 RIKER / All transporter rooms are standing by.
 WORF / (concerned, off console) Captain, I am picking up power emissions from the Fleming... they may be attempting to initiate their warp drive.
 RIKER / They must have been able to repair their engines...
 DATA / Captain, if they activate their engines --
 PICARD / I know, Data. (to Worf) Can we establish communications?
 WORF / No, sir... subspace interference is too high...
 PICARD / How long until we reach transporter range?
 WORF / Fifty-three seconds...
 RIKER / (grim) I don't think we're going to make it...
 WORF / (continuing) Sir, they are activating their warp drive...
 PICARD / Report!
 WORF / Damage on decks six and fourteen... our structural integrity field is holding.
 RIKER / What about the Fleming?
 DATA / (off console) They are badly damaged, sir... their life support systems are failing.
 RIKER / (to com) All transporter rooms, prepare for emergency evacuation procedures...
 DATA / (interrupting, off console) Captain, when the Fleming activated its warp drive, the rift expanded by two-point-three percent... (beat) We no longer have sufficient momentum to escape.
 DATA / Captain, distortion wave intensity has increased by a factor of ten.
 WORF / We are within transporter range of the Fleming, sir. Commencing evacuation procedures...
 DATA / Distortion waves are now occurring every fifty-nine seconds... Hull stress is nearing maximum tolerance...
 RIKER / Data, what if we forced an EPS discharge through the impulse reactor... would that be enough to blast us out of here?
 DATA / I do not believe so, sir... and the resulting explosion would most likely destroy the saucer section in the process...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain...
 GEORDI / (continuing) We might be able to get out of here without using the warp engines.
 RIKER / How, Geordi?
 GEORDI / When's the last time you went surfing, Commander?
 RIKER / A couple of months ago, on Risa... I nearly killed myself on the break at Kattala beach.
 GEORDI / Feel like catching another wave?
 PICARD / (catching on) A distortion wave...
 GEORDI / Exactly, sir. If can phase-match our deflector shield to the EM variants of the distortion wave, when the next one hits, we'll be pulled along with it...
 RIKER / (to Picard) We could ride it out of the rift and break away once we're clear. (beat) Assuming we survive the ride.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Is everyone off the Fleming?
 WORF / The last of the crew has been beamed aboard, sir.
 PICARD / All right, Mister La Forge. Get us out of here.
 GEORDI / Yes, sir... I'm phase matching the deflector shield now...
 DATA / (off console) The next distortion wave will impact in fourteen seconds...
 GEORDI / Matching phases... (beat) Prepare to engage shield emitters on my mark...
 DATA / Ten seconds...
 GEORDI / Ready...
 PICARD / (to Data) Engage shield emitters... full power...
 DATA / Distortion wave impact... now.
 DATA / (off console) We were unable to maintain contact with the distortion wave, sir... we are still within the rift.
 PICARD / (to com) What went wrong, Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / (checks a panel) The speed differential between us and the wave was too high, sir... the shock of the impact threw us off.
 DATA / Another distortion wave is approaching... impact in twenty-six seconds.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Our hull stress is already critical... we can't handle many more jolts like that one...
 DATA / Captain, I suggest we take the ship to full impulse. If we can attain sufficient speed, it will lessen the shock when the wave hits.
 PICARD / Helm, full impulse. Head us out of the rift. (beat; to com)) Shield emitters, stand-by.
 GEORDI / We're ready, sir.
 DATA / Distortion wave impact in five seconds...
 PICARD / Engage emitters... now.
 DATA / We are in the distortion wave... hull stresses exceeding tolerance...
 WORF / Structural integrity fields failing on decks ten through sixteen..
 DATA / We are within the distortion wave... hull stresses exceeding tolerance...
 WORF / Structural integrity fields failing on decks ten through sixteen... switching to backups...
 GEORDI / (to com) Captain, we're separating from the distortion wave... I'm attempting to compensate...
 PICARD / (to Data) How much longer until we clear the rift?
 DATA / Approximately twelve seconds... (beat) Hull stress is now one-hundred twenty percent above maximum...
 WORF / Structural breach is imminent...
 DATA / We have cleared the rift. Hull stresses have returned to normal.
 PICARD / Cancel red alert.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47314.5. We have been continuing our research, while the Federation Council studies our reports on the subspace rift. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / It now appears certain that what we've seen here will have repercussions for many years to come.
 GEORDI / Our scans have shown a lot of subspace instabilities all through the sector. If they're exposed to enough warp energy, they might eventually create other rifts.
 PICARD / (to Geordi and Rabal) Thank you, gentlemen.
 PICARD / (to group) We've received new directives from the Federation Council on this matter...
 PICARD / (continuing) Until we can find a way to counteract the warp field effect, the Council feels our best course is to slow the damage as much as possible... (beat) Therefore, areas of space found susceptible to warp fields will be restricted to essential travel only... (beat) And effective immediately, all Federation vessels will be limited to a speed of warp five, except in cases of extreme emergency.
 WORF / Sir, the Klingons will observe these restrictions, but the Romulans will not.
 TROI / And what about the Ferengi... and the Cardassians for that matter?
 PICARD / The Federation is sharing our data with all known warp-capable species. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / All we can hope is that they realize it's in their best interests to take similar action.
 BEVERLY / Putting limits on warp speed is only going to prevent other rifts from forming. What are we going to do about this one?
 GEORDI / Unfortunately, right now there's not much we can do.
 PICARD / Starfleet is setting up a weather control network for Hekaras Two. It's only a temporary solution, but it should suffice for now.
 RIKER / We were lucky the rift formed as far away from the planet as it did. At least we have a little time to consider our options.
 PICARD / If there are no further questions, you're dismissed.
 GEORDI / We should have the thermal stabilizers ready for the Hekarans in another day, sir.
 PICARD / Very well.
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) But now I can't help but wonder if all the while I was really helping to destroy the very thing I hold dear.
 GEORDI / It's not going to turn out that way, sir. We still have time to make it better.
 PICARD (V.O) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47410.2. The Atrean government has requested assistance in averting a natural disaster that is threatening their world. Two of their geologists have come aboard to discuss the problem, one of whom is a human who has been living on Atrea Four.
 PICARD, GEORDI, and DATA look on as Atrean Scientist / PRAN TAINER stands before an OKUDAGRAM depicting a cross-section of the Atrean planet. Also present is Pran's human wife, JULIANA TAINER, a fiftyish woman dressed in Atrean fashion. The Atreans are a humanoid species, only slightly different from us.
 GEORDI / We could minimize seismic activity by creating isobaric fissures and releasing some of the tectonic stress -- but that would just be a temporary fix.
 DATA / The only permanent solution would be to re-liquefy the core.
 GEORDI / These pockets in the magma layer -- how close are they to the molten region of the core?
 GEORDI / You think that's close enough to try ferro-plasmic infusion?
 DATA / The procedure would involve using our ship's phasers to drill down through the planet's surface and into the pockets -- where we would set up a series of plasma infusion units.
 GEORDI / We'd trigger the units by firing a modulated energy burst down through the shafts.
 DATA / It should be possible to stabilize the core temperature at ninety-three percent of normal.
 PICARD / If you give your permission, we'll begin immediately.
 GEORDI / I'll be glad to help you, Doctor.
 PICARD / (to Pran and Juliana) I've assigned you quarters during the time we're here. Please make yourselves comfortable.
 DATA / Yes, Doctor?
 DATA / You are Doctor Juliana Tainer.
 DATA / Have we met before?
 DATA / (taken aback) You were a colleague of Doctor Soong?
 DATA / Doctor, I have no memory of you.
 DATA / (pondering) My memory record begins when I was activated by the Starfleet officers who found me on the Omicron Theta outpost.
 DATA / Yes. All of the inhabitants of the colony had been killed.
 DATA / But -- I discovered that my memory banks contained the contents of their journals and logs.
 DATA / My -- childhood?
 DATA / Hiccuping?
 DATA / So you wiped my memory processors after this -- childhood.
 DATA / Doctor, I have scanned the colonists' journals... there is only one Juliana mentioned in them, and her last name is O'Donnell.
 DATA / But there is no mention that my father was married to you.
 DATA / My father did have an unusual way of looking at things...
 DATA / I encountered him once -- in the Terlina system.
 DATA / It was shortly before his death.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / What do you mean?
 DATA / This has been an interesting encounter, and one altogether unexpected. I would like to corroborate what you have told me before we proceed further.
 DATA / Excuse me, Doctor.
 GEORDI / I'm just about finished reconfiguring the phaser banks. We should be ready to start drilling in about an hour.
 DATA / Inform me when you are ready.
 GEORDI / What are you doing there, anyway?
 DATA / I am attempting to ascertain whether Doctor Tainer's story is true.
 GEORDI / Don't you believe her?
 DATA / I neither doubt nor believe her. I am simply attempting to verify her assertions.
 GEORDI / Well, what have you turned up so far?
 DATA / The Registrar's Office on Mavala Four cannot confirm that Doctor Soong was married there. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / Apparently many documents were lost when the government was overthrown.
 GEORDI / Then what are you looking at?
 DATA / I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavala during the period in question.
 DATA / O'Donnell, Juliana... (beat) Soong, Noonian -- they were both passengers on a transport that travelled from Omicron Theta to Mavala... and returned four days later.
 GEORDI / That sure seems to fit her story.
 DATA / Still, the fact that they went to Mavala does not prove they were married there.
 GEORDI / You know, Data... I almost get the feeling you're trying to prove that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling the truth.
 DATA / Not at all. I am merely unable to reconcile her story with the fact that my father never mentioned her to me.
 GEORDI / Well, she did leave him. Maybe she broke his heart. Maybe he just didn't want to talk about her...
 GEORDI / (continuing) And let me ask you this... Doctor Soong created an emotion chip for you... didn't Lore tell you it also contained memories -- memories Soong wanted you to have?
 DATA / Yes. (beat) It is possible that those are the memories of my childhood. And of my mother.
 GEORDI / And if you think about it -- why would she lie? Why would someone pretend to be your mother?
 DATA / I can think of no motive for such a pretense.
 GEORDI / I can understand why you might be a little disconcerted by all this... it came out of the blue... and the story doesn't fit neatly into your logical processors.
 DATA / That is true...
 GEORDI / But that's life, Data. Part of being human is learning to handle the unexpected... to risk new experiences even when they don't fit your preconceptions.
 DATA / I will admit that it is difficult for me to accept the possibility of a past about which I know nothing... (beat) But it is also true that I am very curious to learn more about it.
 DATA / I would like to get to know you. (beat) Mother.
 DATA / (intrigued) How did you decide?
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / Pleased?
 DATA / (after her) You misunderstand; Counselor Troi is a therapist --
 DATA / Doctor Tainer has provided me with many details about my development that I was not aware of. Conversing with her was a fascinating experience --
 TROI / But... ?
 DATA / Her interest in me seems to be... limitless.
 TROI / She's your mother, Data. That's how parents are.
 DATA / I was a parent. I do not recall exhibiting excessive interest in Lal's behavior.
 TROI / Data, you and Lal were practically inseparable the entire time she was alive.
 DATA / Yes, but... she needed my help.
 TROI / (smiles) That's how every parent feels. It's very hard to let your children go out into the world and fend for themselves. You can't help but be protective of them. I'm sure your mother feels the same way.
 DATA / If that is true... then why did she never attempt to contact me?
 TROI / I don't know, Data. It could have something to do with your parents' separating... you were part of a life she might have wanted to put behind her.
 TROI / But if you really want to know, why don't you ask her?
 DATA / We will be in position over the drilling site in three minutes, twenty-nine seconds.
 DATA / (continuing) These scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to set up the infusion units are somewhat unstable.
 GEORDI / (to Data) I've configured the phasers to create the most highly focused particle beam possible.
 DATA / Thank you, Geordi.
 GEORDI / Data? That's hard to picture --
 DATA / I am incapable of embarrassment. Please, continue.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bridge to Engineering.
 GEORDI / La Forge, here. Go ahead, Commander.
 RIKER is coordinating the drilling process. WORF is at / tactical; Pran hovers a bit fretfully, concerned that it will all go well.
 RIKER / We've established synchronous orbit over the drilling site.
 GEORDI / Phaser modifications are on-line, sir.
 DATA / My calculations indicate that the first phaser blast will be approximately nineteen seconds in duration.
 RIKER / Acknowledged.
 RIKER / No, but I'm sure Data knows what he's doing.
 RIKER / I have complete confidence in his ability to "check up" on himself.
 RIKER / (continuing) Mister Worf... ?
 WORF / Phasers are locked on target.
 RIKER / Fire when ready.
 DATA / (off console) The beam has penetrated eight kilometers beneath the surface...
 WORF / Standing by.
 DATA / We are within two kilometers of the magma pocket.
 WORF / (works) Terminating beam.
 DATA / I detect no increase in stress levels in the surrounding magma.
 RIKER / Good work. I don't think we could have gotten in any cleaner.
 DATA / The drilling process has raised the temperature inside the magma pocket by almost three hundred degrees C. It will be several hours before it cools enough for us to enter.
 DATA / I do not.
 DATA / Thank you. I have been practicing for a recital tomorrow evening.
 DATA / I have been told that my playing is technically flawless, but it has never been described as beautiful.
 DATA / Are you certain that you are not saying that because you are my Mother? (off her reaction) I have observed that parents tend to exaggerate when it comes to their children's accomplishments.
 DATA / I do not know for certain... but I believe that it is during my creative endeavors that I come closest to experiencing what it might be like to be human.
 DATA / As am I.
 DATA / I would like that very much.
 DATA / I can replicate one for you.
 DATA / Yes.
 DATA / I am attempting to master all known styles of painting.
 DATA / (continuing) This one is in the style of the early French impressionists...
 DATA / That is Lal, my daughter.
 DATA / Yes. I created her... using myself as a model.
 DATA / The positronic matrix I designed for her was unstable. She only lived a short time.
 DATA / In a sense, you were her grandmother...
 DATA / (continuing) Would you like to practice now?
 DATA / The acoustics in Ten Forward are quite favorable.
 DATA / Of course.
 DATA / Perhaps. I created Lal because I wished to procreate. Despite what happened to her, I still have that wish.
 DATA / I was not aware that he created any androids before my brother.
 DATA / Mother... I am that android. Are you saying that you were against my creation?
 DATA / Then... why did you never attempt to contact me?
 DATA / What?
 DATA / Perhaps if you told me what has made you feel that way, your guilt might be alleviated.
 DATA / (off console) We are within four kilometers of the magma pocket...
 DATA / (continuing) Doctor, should we lower the beam intensity?
 WORF / Acknowledged.
 GEORDI / (off console) We're getting feedback pulses along the particle beam --
 RIKER / We're going to have to terminate the beam if this keeps up --
 DATA / If we do, we will have to begin a new shaft at another suitable location --
 GEORDI / Doctor, it's going to take longer than that to match the resonant --
 GEORDI / You did it --
 GEORDI / (off console) We've broken through --
 DATA / (off console) I am detecting no signs of instability...
 RIKER / (to com) Data, Doctor Tainer -- we'll meet you in Transporter Room Two.
 DATA / Acknowledged.
 DATA / I have initialized the plasma induction coils.
 DATA / I am incapable of anger.
 DATA / I am not certain that I do. Perhaps you could clarify them for me?
 DATA / If I had been your biological offspring, would you have left me behind on Omicron Theta?
 DATA / Doctor Tainer, I have the impression that you are trying to spare my feelings. I assure you, that is not necessary.
 DATA / Is that because you place more value on biological life than on artificial life?
 DATA / I do. Thank you for making it clear to me.
 which has been converted into a recital hall. Picard, BEVERLY, TROI, Riker, Geordi and Pran are seated amid / some SUPERNUMERARIES, enjoying the concert.
 TROI / Data, I don't think I've ever heard you play more... (searches) ... expressively.
 PICARD / That was wonderful, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / (smiles) I see where Data gets his musical talents.
 DATA / Thank you.
 DATA / Would you excuse me? There is something I must do.
 BEVERLY / Data... why do you need Doctor Tainer's medical records? Is something wrong with her?
 DATA / I am not certain. Perhaps you could determine that from her Transporter trace pattern.
 BEVERLY / I probably could... but I don't ordinarily look into someone's medical status unless I have a good reason.
 DATA / Doctor... I would ask that you not require me to be more specific. But I assure you that I have a good reason for asking.
 BEVERLY / All right, Data...
 BEVERLY / (continuing, studying it) Well... at first glance I don't see anything wrong -- except for some mild hypertension, which is perfectly normal for a woman her age.
 DATA / I see.
 BEVERLY / Maybe you should tell me what her symptoms are.
 DATA / (eyeing the readout) She has not complained of any discomfort.
 BEVERLY / Then... why did you want to look at her medical records?
 DATA / Because... I have reason to believe she is not who she claims to be...
 RIKER (V.O.) / Bridge to Data...
 DATA / (hits combadge) Go ahead, Commander...
 RIKER (V.O.) / There's been a cave-in in one of the magma pockets. You're needed in Transporter room two.
 DATA / On my way. (to Beverly) Excuse me, Doctor.
 GEORDI / (off console) It looks like the area has stabilized, but seismic stress is building up -- eventually, the pocket will collapse.
 RIKER / How long, Geordi?
 GEORDI / It's hard to say... twelve hours at most.
 RIKER / I'd rather not send anyone back down there.
 RIKER / All right. But I want you in and out of there as quickly as possible.
 DATA / Acknowledged, Commander.
 GEORDI / (to Data) One of the transporter's pattern enhancers was thrown out of alignment by the seismic activity -- I'm getting a normal power signature from it so you should be able to re-align it for the beam out.
 DATA / Energize.
 DATA / There will be more seismic activity. We must hurry.
 DATA / The shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity -- it should be possible to trigger the unit from orbit.
 DATA / (works) Priming the energy transfer matrix...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Data.
 DATA / (hits combadge) Data, here. Go ahead, Commander.
 RIKER / We're reading an increase in seismic stress levels.
 DATA / Understood. We will attempt to expedite our work.
 RIKER / Data! Are you all right?
 DATA / Yes, Commander. We will be returning to the beam-out point shortly.
 DATA / No, we are too far below the surface.
 DATA / There are no hand-holds in the rock face.
 DATA / (continuing) We will have to jump.
 DATA / You will --
 GEORDI / Basically, she's a Soong-type android -- except everything about her is designed to fool you into thinking she's human.
 BEVERLY / She's got tear ducts, sweat glands -- even veins and capillaries underneath her skin.
 RIKER / Why does the scanner read her as a human?
 BEVERLY / There's a feedback processor that's designed to send out a false bio-signal.
 GEORDI / It's tied in with her aging program -- she not only ages in appearance, like Data, her vital signs change too.
 BEVERLY / What I can't figure out is why she lost consciousness. As far as I can see, everything's fine -- she should be awake.
 DATA / Check her positronic matrix -- there may be a cascade anomaly.
 RIKER / Data -- you said you knew she was an android... how?
 DATA / The first indication occurred when we were drilling. I saw her perform several complex calculations without the assistance of the computer.
 RIKER / That could just have meant she was good at math --
 DATA / That is true. But it was enough to draw my attention. Later, I noticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes.
 DATA / (continuing) The intervals between blinks were governed by a Fourier Series -- the same mathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern the appearance of randomness.
 RIKER / I can't imagine anyone but you noticing something like that.
 DATA / Then there was our concert in Ten Forward.
 RIKER / What about it?
 DATA / (continuing) We had practiced the piece, and I noticed that she played it the same way during the performance -- every pitch, every intonation, was exactly the same. Only an artificial life-form could have done that.
 RIKER / Does her husband have any idea?
 DATA / I do not believe so. He is on the surface, to monitor the plasma infusion.
 RIKER / That's probably just as well...
 GEORDI / Data, take a look at this.
 DATA (O.S.) / It appears to be an information module...
 DATA / (continuing) With a holographic interface.
 DATA / That is correct.
 DATA / I am Data.
 DATA / I am fine.
 DATA / You refer to Doctor Tainer as my mother -- yet the complexity of her design indicates she was created after I was.
 DATA / What happened to her?
 DATA / And you never told her the truth?
 DATA / What happened?
 DATA / If she recovers and learns that she is an android --
 DATA / Then... you do not believe she should know the truth.
 DATA / It seems that I must make a decision: to tell Doctor Tainer that she is an android -- or withhold that knowledge from her. And I do not know what to do.
 BEVERLY / Why was Doctor Soong so adamant that she not be told?
 DATA / He seemed certain that if she knew, it would preclude the possibility of her being happy.
 PICARD / And -- what do you think?
 DATA / I am not certain. (beat) I can understand why my father felt as he did -- but his wishes are not necessarily paramount. I am concerned with what would be best for -- my mother.
 BEVERLY / Wouldn't she be better off knowing the truth? Dealing with the reality of her existence?
 TROI / I don't think so. She's believed she's human all her life. The truth might be devastating to her.
 DATA / I have noticed that her present husband seems uncomfortable with the fact that I am an artificial life-form. If he finds out about his wife, it may adversely affect their relationship.
 BEVERLY / He doesn't have to know -- if you tell her, it would be up to her whether or not to tell him.
 PICARD / Data, there might come a time in the future when she would find out anyway -- another accident, for example. Perhaps it would be easier for her to learn the truth from you.
 BEVERLY / I can tell you that if I were in her place... I'd rather have my son tell me than some stranger...
 DATA / I find that I am having difficulty separating what would be best for her... from what would be best for me.
 TROI / What do you mean?
 DATA / If she knew she were an android, she and I would have something to share. I would no longer be alone in the universe.
 TROI / I know how much that would mean to you... but at the same time, telling her would rob her of the one thing you've wanted all your life -- to be human.
 PICARD / It's a difficult choice. (beat) You must do what you think best, Data. We will support any decision you make.
 DATA / You were knocked unconscious by the fall... you broke a bone in your arm, but Doctor Crusher repaired it.
 DATA / (continuing) Everything is fine, Mother.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. The infusion of plasma into the core of Atrea Four has been accomplished. Pran Tainer's projections indicate that the core will remain molten for several hundred years.
 DATA / Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my next leave.
 DATA / Mother... I remembered something that I thought you should know.
 DATA / (continuing) Before he died, my father told me that he had only one great love in his life... and that he regretted never letting her know how much he cared for her. (beat) I am certain he was referring to you.
 DATA / Good-bye, Mother.
 WORF is alone in the shuttle, shining his BAT'LETH / SWORD with a cloth. He eyes the sword with satisfaction, then sets it down and moves to the helm. He taps a control. (NOTE: He faces the console, as though looking into a "camera".)
 WORF / (to computer) Personal log, Stardate 47391.2. I am returning from the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions were difficult... several contenders were maimed. But I was triumphant...
 WORF / (continuing) I won "Champion Standing."
 WORF / (continuing) I look forward to resuming my duties aboard the Enterprise. However, I am anticipating a... troubling situation.
 RIKER / It looks like we're going to have to head out to the Argus Array. This is the third time in the last year it's stopped relaying data. Starfleet's beginning to think it may be more than a simple malfunction.
 RIKER / (continuing) I want you to start a long range scan as soon as we enter the --
 RIKER / Are you listening to me, Lieutenant?
 WORF / Oh... yes, sir.
 RIKER / You seem pretty tense for a man who just came back from vacation.
 WORF / Today... is my birthday.
 RIKER / What's the matter with you?
 WORF / Because it is my birthday... I assumed that you or one of the others would try to mount an unexpected... social gathering.
 RIKER / You mean a surprise party? Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would never do that to you.
 WORF / I am... sorry, Commander.
 RIKER / Why don't you settle in and I'll meet you on the Bridge.
 WORF / Aye sir.
 TROI, BEVERLY, GEORDI, DATA and SEVERAL N.D.S as they / rush out of the bedroom. Many hold birthday GIFTS -- others have party favors, noise-makers. It's the most human and obnoxious party you can imagine. They come up shaking his hand, offering birthday wishes, patting him on the back. Troi and Beverly kiss him on the cheek. Riker ENTERS during the middle of all this, comes up behind Worf with huge smile on his face.
 RIKER / Actually, Worf, I love surprise parties.
 WORF / That was not a Klingon song.
 TROI / It wasn't easy to translate. There doesn't seem to be a Klingon word for "jolly".
 BEVERLY / It's traditional for the birthday boy to cut the cake.
 RIKER / Captain Picard sends his birthday wishes. He was needed on the Bridge.
 DATA / Happy birthday, Worf.
 WORF / Thank you....
 WORF / Ah... a painting.
 DATA / Yes. I have entered my Abstract Expressionistic phase. This is my interpretation of the Battle of HarOS.
 WORF / The Battle of HarOS... ?
 TROI / I think it's wonderful. And I know just where to hang it...
 WORF / What are you doing?
 TROI / I always thought this room could use a little more color.
 GEORDI / (re: painting) Battle of HarOS, right?
 GEORDI / You alright?
 WORF / I believe Commander Data's painting is making me dizzy...
 WORF / (casual) I thought this cake was chocolate...
 TROI / Don't I wish.
 TROI / (re: gift) This is from Alexander. He gave it to me before he left to visit your parents.
 GEORDI / What is it?
 WORF / Alexander's forehead. (proudly) The ridges of a warrior.
 TROI / He really wished he could've been here when you got back from shore leave. You should have seen him, Worf... he stayed up all night talking about how proud he was of his father.
 WORF / Thank you for watching him while I was away.
 TROI / It was my pleasure.
 PICARD / So... how old are you, Mister Worf?
 WORF / Captain -- I was told you couldn't attend.
 PICARD / I wouldn't miss this for the world. How old are you?
 WORF / I am... old enough.
 PICARD / Report.
 DATA / (off console) The Array appears to be functioning normally, sir.
 RIKER / That can't be right. We were told it stopped relaying data six days ago.
 DATA / The Array is still transmitting data. However, it is no longer sending that information to the Federation. (off console) It appears that someone has redirected its imaging systems.
 PICARD / Where is the information being sent now?
 DATA / (works) Sector One-nine-six-five-eight. I am unable to access the Array's main computer, so it is impossible to determine the exact location.
 RIKER / What's in that sector?
 WORF / It is uninhabited. But there could easily be a ship, or a subspace relay station receiving the data.
 RIKER / Captain. I suggest we beam a repair crew aboard the Array. We can download the imaging logs -- find out what the Array's been observing for the past six days.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 WORF / Excuse me, Counselor. Do you have a moment?
 TROI / Of course.
 WORF / I have been meaning to speak with you... about Alexander.
 TROI / Oh?
 WORF / It has never been easy for me... having Alexander on board. I have always tried to be a good father... to give him guidance... but he seems to have his own mind about some things.
 TROI / Most children do.
 WORF / I could not have gotten this far without your help. Alexander looks up to you. At times, I have felt that you are like a mother to him.
 TROI / Worf... that's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
 WORF / Once, when I thought I was going to die... I asked you to watch over Alexander. I was wondering... if you might consider formalizing that arrangement. (beat) I want you to be Alexander's SohchIm.
 TROI / His "Soh-chIm"?
 WORF / You would become his surrogate mother. In case anything ever happened to me, you would be responsible for him.
 TROI / Worf, I don't know what to say. It's a great honor. (beat) So this would make me your...
 WORF / The closest analogy would be... step-sister.
 TROI / That would make my mother your step-mother.
 WORF / I had not considered that... (with humor) It is a risk I am willing to take.
 TROI / I accept.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Lieutenant Worf, please report to Engineering.
 WORF / (taps combadge) On my way.
 DATA / (to Worf) We have analyzed the imaging logs. It appears that the Array was reprogrammed to observe several Federation sites.
 GEORDI / (indicates screen) This is Deep Space Five... Starbase Forty-seven... the Iadara Colony... and this is the Utopia Planitia Shipyard.
 PICARD / (reacts) The Utopia Planitia shipyard... they're responsible for new starship development...
 WORF / (realizing) Someone is using the Array for covert surveillance of the Federation.
 DATA / That is our theory. We believe that unauthorized access was made six days ago. The imaging logs from that day show a ship approaching the Array...
 WORF / That's a Cardassian ship. Galor Class.
 GEORDI / We're only three light years from Cardassian space. They would've had easy access to the Array.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, start a long range scan of the region... see if there are any Cardassian ships nearby.
 WORF / Aye sir.
 GEORDI / (re: PADD) Here's a propulsion analysis of the Cardassian ship. You might try scanning for its energy configuration.
 DATA (O.S.) / Are you alright, Lieutenant?
 WORF / I feel... dizzy...
 GEORDI / Worf, you don't look so good. Maybe you should go to Sickbay...
 WORF / Yes... perhaps I will.
 BEVERLY / Any nausea... or blurred vision?
 WORF / No. However, I did experience dizziness earlier today... at my birthday celebration.
 BEVERLY / (casually) It sounds like you're having a few side-effects from the concussion. I'll give you vertazine for the dizziness... but I want you to get some rest.
 WORF / Doctor... perhaps you are thinking of another patient. I have no concussion.
 BEVERLY / Worf... you came in here this morning complaining about a ringing in your ears. I scanned you... you had a concussion.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Are you telling me you don't remember any of this?
 WORF / No...
 BEVERLY / Temporary memory loss is common with this kind of injury... (prompting) Do you remember telling me about the Bat'leth tournament? You said one of the competitors hit you in the head... that's why you lost the match...
 WORF / I won that tournament. I can prove it to you.
 BEVERLY / What's wrong?
 WORF / It says... "Ninth Place."
 WORF / This is not the same trophy... (beat) Someone is playing a trick on me.
 BEVERLY / Worf, try to calm down. Memory loss can be very disorienting...
 WORF / The log... I recorded a personal log on my way back to the Enterprise.
 WORF / (to computer) Computer -- access personal logs on Shuttlecraft Curie. Show my log entry for Stardate 47391.2.
 WORF ON MONITOR / Personal log, Stardate 47391.2. I am returning from the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions were difficult... several contenders were maimed.
 WORF ON MONITOR / (continuing) One of the contenders used an illegal T'gha maneuver against me. The judges chose to ignore it... and I was robbed of my rightful standing.
 WORF ON MONITOR / I was awarded "Ninth Place". (beat) I look forward to resuming my duties aboard the Enterprise. However, I am --
 WORF / I do not understand...
 BEVERLY / I'm sure this must be very disturbing for you... but don't worry. Your memories will eventually return to normal.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) The best thing you can do right now is settle back into your normal routine... but slowly.
 WORF / Thank you, Doctor.
 BEVERLY / If you have any more problems with dizziness, let me know.
 DATA / Lieutenant, have you completed the metallurgical scan of the Array?
 WORF / Sir?
 DATA / The metallurgical scan. Is it complete?
 WORF / I do not remember you asking me to --
 WORF / Captain. There is a Cardassian ship approaching. Galor Class.
 PICARD / Open a channel.
 WORF / On screen.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. You are in Federation territory. Please explain your presence here.
 PICARD / We are repairing one of our subspace telescopes.
 PICARD / No, thank you. We have everything under control.
 PICARD / It's a long range subspace Array... it gathers data on astronomical phenomena.
 PICARD / Certainly not.
 RIKER / Charming fellow.
 WORF / Captain -- that ship was responsible for reprogramming the Array.
 PICARD / What do you mean?
 WORF / (off console) It is the same Class and energy configuration as the ship we saw in the imaging logs.
 PICARD / Imaging logs... Are you saying you have evidence that the Cardassians tampered with the Array?
 WORF / They have been using the Array as a surveillance device. (beat) You saw the logs yourself.
 PICARD / I haven't heard anything about this.
 RIKER / Neither have I.
 WORF / Commander Data -- show them the imaging logs you downloaded from the Array.
 DATA / I know of no such logs, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / Worf... are you feeling alright?
 WORF / Yes.
 PICARD / Mister Data, perhaps you should re-examine the Array... see if you can find anything to support Worf's claims. (to Worf) In the meantime, Lieutenant... I think you should go to your quarters.
 WORF / Doctor Crusher says I am experiencing further memory loss... but my instincts tell me it is more than that... (beat) I remember those imaging logs... I could tell you every detail... every word...
 TROI / Worf, let's assume you're right for a second -- that things did happen as you remember them. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / Are you saying that everyone's memory on this ship has been altered but yours? (beat) The only one of us who's had a recent head injury or mental stress is you. Isn't it more logical that your concussion is causing some memory problems?
 WORF / Enter.
 GEORDI / Hi, Worf. I wanted you to know that we re-examined the imaging logs. They don't show a Cardassian ship... or any evidence that the Array was reprogrammed. (MORE)
 GEORDI (Cont'd) / (beat) From what we can tell, the Array suffered a simple mechanical failure.
 WORF / That is not right. I am certain that --
 TROI / What's wrong?
 WORF / The painting Commander Data gave me...
 WORF / (continuing) It has moved.
 TROI / Worf, I hung that painting there... at your birthday party. Remember?
 WORF / No...
 WORF / The painting has changed... don't you see it?
 WORF / Your hair... and your clothing... they have changed, as well...
 GEORDI / Worf, maybe you should --
 PICARD / (urgent) Now, Mister Worf! (beat) Now!
 RIKER / (urgent) Worf, what are you waiting for? Raise shields.
 WORF / This panel configuration has been altered, sir. I do not know how to --
 DATA / (off console) Direct hit -- Engineering Section, Deck Forty-two. Shield generators are overloading.
 PICARD / (to Riker, re: Worf) Number One.
 RIKER / (working) Firing photon torpedoes, full spread.
 RIKER / (off console) Direct hit on their main reactor... they're returning fire!
 DATA / (off console) Captain, we have sustained heavy damage to our deflector systems. Hull breaches on Decks Seventeen and Thirty-six.
 PICARD / (to Conn) Ensign, take us out of here, maximum warp.
 PICARD / Are they pursuing?
 RIKER / No, sir. (off console) But they're firing on the Argus Array... (beat) They've destroyed it, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge to Engineering. Status, Mister La Forge?
 PICARD / What happened back there, Lieutenant?
 WORF / I believe I had another... memory loss.
 RIKER / "Memory loss"... What are you talking about?
 WORF / I do not feel well, Captain. Request to be temporarily relieved of duty.
 PICARD / Granted.
 WORF / (to computer) Computer -- access personal logs on Shuttlecraft Curie. Play log entry for Stardate 47391.2.
 WORF / (to computer) Computer, display any log entries regarding the Bat'leth Tournament on Forcas Three.
 WORF ON MONITOR / Personal log, Stardate 47391.2. There has been a malfunction in the ship's main deflector. It will require two more days of repairs.
 WORF ON MONITOR / (continuing) As a result, I will not be able to compete in the Bat'leth tournament on Forcas Three. I have asked my brother to take my place. He does not have my prowess with the blade, but --
 TROI / (matter of fact) Why'd you lock the door?
 WORF / (sharp) Why shouldn't I?
 TROI / I heard about what happened on the Bridge. Are you all right?
 WORF / I am not sure...
 TROI / Do you want to talk about it?
 WORF / I would rather not, Counselor.
 TROI / (a little wry) Very well, Lieutenant.
 TROI / (to replicator) Hot chocolate.
 WORF / Is there something I can do for you?
 TROI / Actually, there is...
 TROI / I want you to sit down. Relax for a minute.
 TROI / You're really tense.
 TROI / Worf... I know you don't want to talk about what happened on the Bridge... but there are times when it's best to open up... (beat) Come on... if you can't talk to me, who can you talk to?
 WORF / I do not believe this is appropriate behavior!
 TROI / Not even for your wife?
 WORF / Wife!
 TROI / Worf, what's wrong?
 WORF / I do not know... things are... changing...
 TROI / What's changed?
 WORF / I do not remember us... you and I... being mates... (beat) It is as if events... circumstances... continue to change from moment to moment... but I am the only one who seems to be aware of it...
 TROI / So... are you saying you don't remember the last three years? You don't remember us falling in love... and getting married?
 WORF / I do remember the last three years... but they are different. We did not have this relationship. We were friends. The Enterprise did not have a battle with the Cardassians...
 WORF / No one believes me.
 TROI / Worf... whatever's wrong... whatever's happened... I want you to know that I believe you... (beat) And that I love you. We'll find out what's happening...
 DATA / (working) I am initiating a subspace scan to search for temporal anomalies on or off the ship.
 TROI / (taps combadge) On my way. (to Data, Worf) Let me know if you find anything.
 WORF / Commander... how long have I been married to Counselor Troi?
 DATA / Two years, one month and twelve days.
 WORF / And when did this... relationship begin?
 DATA / It is my understanding that your romantic affiliation began soon after you recovered from your spinal injury on Stardate 45587.
 WORF / I remember that... A cargo container fell on me.
 DATA / That is correct. After that, I observed that you and the Counselor began to spend more time together.
 WORF / When did it become... romantic?
 DATA / It was approximately six months later that you asked Commander Riker for his formal permission to court Counselor Troi. (beat) You felt that to do otherwise would be dishonorable.
 WORF / And then we mated.
 DATA / I am not privy to the exact details of when, where and how the first coupling took place. I could investigate it if you --
 WORF / No... that is alright.
 DATA / I am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system.
 DATA / (continuing) Perhaps we should try to pinpoint the exact moment when events became discontinuous. Do you remember the first change?
 WORF / I went to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher told me I had a concussion... but I do not remember that happening.
 DATA / Think back. Are you sure that was the very first change? Perhaps there was one before you entered Sickbay?
 WORF / Before...
 WORF / Yes... yes. In Engineering. I felt a wave of dizziness... and when I looked up, you and Commander La Forge were on the opposite side of the room. Captain Picard was gone. (MORE)
 WORF (Cont'd) / I thought I had blacked out for a moment, and had not observed your movements.
 WORF / (continuing) And at my birthday party... the cake was chocolate, then it was yellow. And Commander Riker told me the Captain was not going to attend... then suddenly the Captain was there.
 DATA / We should try to find any commonalties in these events. Where were you each time?
 WORF / (thinks) I was at the party... then I was in Engineering... then in my quarters...
 DATA / What about the people you were with? Was there anyone who was present at all three events?
 WORF / Everyone was at my birthday party... then I was with Counselor Troi... then Commander La Forge entered... (realizes) Geordi was in all three locations. And he was near me in each case, just before I noticed the differences. (beat) Do you think there is a connection?
 DATA / It is possible. We should speak with Commander La Forge.
 DATA / Doctor, is Geordi well enough to answer some questions?
 DATA / (off tricorder) There do not appear to be any unusual readings. Energy residuals from the plasma burns... the beginnings of cellular decomposition...
 DATA / (to Worf) I see nothing that connects these bio-readings to your recent sense of discontinuity.
 DATA / (off tricorder) I still see nothing unusual.
 DATA / Perhaps we should activate it.
 DATA / The VISOR is active.
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Worf... are you alright?
 DATA / Have you noticed another discontinuity, Commander?
 WORF / A moment ago, Doctor Crusher was not here. It was... Doctor Ogawa.
 BEVERLY / Doctor Ogawa?
 WORF / And my uniform is different... what is my rank and position?
 TROI / You're a Commander... and First Officer.
 WORF / (to Troi) Are we still married?
 TROI / Yes...
 DATA / (off tricorder, to Worf) I am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular RNA...
 WORF / What does it mean?
 DATA / I do not know. I will have to analyze these readings...
 DATA / I have found that the quantum flux in Worf's cellular RNA extends to the subatomic level. It is asynchronous with normal matter. (beat) In essence, Captain -- Mister Worf does not belong in our universe.
 RIKER / (reacts) What?
 DATA / All matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature. This signature is a constant. It cannot be changed by any known process. It is the basic foundation of existence.
 RIKER / And you believe that Worf's quantum signature is different from ours...
 DATA / Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. It is as if he originates from a different quantum universe.
 RIKER / But he's standing right here in front of us. He's been on the ship for seven years.
 DATA / I cannot explain that either. According to my understanding of physics, Worf should not exist.
 RIKER / (to Worf) You say these discontinuities started to occur after you returned from a Bat'leth tournament on Forcas Three.
 WORF / Yes sir.
 RIKER / Now, I know for a fact that you didn't attend that tournament... and that no shuttlecraft has left the Enterprise for over a month.
 WORF / I understand. But I also clearly remember attending the tournament, and returning to the ship in a shuttlecraft.
 RIKER / Do you remember the course you took to return to the ship?
 WORF / I think so.
 RIKER / Let's backtrack that course... see if there are any unusual readings or anomalies.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 WORF / If I may inquire, sir... how long have you been Captain?
 RIKER / Four years. Ever since Captain Picard was killed during an incident with the Borg. (beat) You don't remember any of this, do you?
 WORF / I do remember. I just remember it differently.
 Riker, Data and N.D.s at stations. Worf is at command. WESLEY CRUSHER is working Tactical, wearing a gold / uniform. There is a CARDASSIAN N.D. working Conn. Various SET DETAILS are different: side panels, lighting, etc.
 WESLEY / (off console) Captain -- I'm picking up a minor subspace disturbance off the port bow.
 RIKER / Full stop. (to Data) Analysis, Data.
 DATA / It appears to be a guantum fissure in the space-time continuum.
 RIKER / On screen.
 DATA / The anomaly cannot be seen. However, I believe I can enhance it with a warp field to make it visible.
 RIKER / Is it dangerous?
 DATA / Not at this distance, sir. (works) I am also detecting an ion trail intersecting the phenomenon. I believe it was left by a Starfleet type-six shuttlecraft.
 WORF / So I was here...
 DATA / I have an explanation, sir.
 DATA / I believe the quantum fissure we discovered is a fixed point across the space-time continuum -- a "keyhole" that intersects many different quantum realities.
 TROI / What do you mean by "quantum realities"?
 DATA / For any event, there is an infinite number of possible outcomes. Our choices determine which outcome will follow. But there is a theory in quantum physics that all possibilities that could happen do happen in alternate quantum realities.
 DATA / (continuing) For instance, in a different quantum reality, Captain Riker may have chosen to sit at the other end of the table. While in another reality, the Captain may be standing.
 BEVERLY / (onto idea) So at this moment, there are an infinite number of Enterprises... and an infinite number of Doctor Crushers having this discussion.
 DATA / Yes. Although on some of those Enterprises, there may not be a Doctor Crusher...
 WORF / And somehow I have been shifting from one reality to another...
 DATA / That is correct.
 TROI / How did this happen?
 DATA / (off graphic) When Worf's shuttlecraft made contact with the quantum fissure, I believe its warp engines caused a small break in the barriers between quantum realties. (beat) Worf was thrown into a state of quantum flux.
 DATA / (continuing) He immediately began to shift to other realities.
 BEVERLY / (onto idea) And Geordi's VISOR somehow triggered that...
 DATA / Exactly. The VISOR uses a subspace field pulse. I think that whenever Geordi came near Worf, the field pulse intensified the quantum flux and pushed Worf into another reality.
 WORF / How can we find my original quantum state... and return me to it?
 WESLEY / Data... what if we scanned the quantum fissure using a subspace differential pulse? Maybe we could locate the quantum state that shares Worf's signature... and find a way to get him back.
 DATA / An excellent idea, Lieutenant.
 RIKER / Proceed.
 TROI / Worf...
 TROI / From what I understand, there's a good chance that my Worf won't return... (beat) And I guess it's just hard for me to accept that there's a reality out there where you never loved me...
 WORF / Deanna... I have always considered you a close friend.
 WORF (Cont'd) / And although I have never seriously considered a romantic relationship... I am not opposed to the possibility...
 TROI / And what about our children?
 WORF / (reacts) Children...
 TROI / You didn't know?
 WORF / When the last shift occurred in Sickbay, we did not have children...
 TROI / We have a little girl... Shannara. She's two years-old. And we have a three year-old boy. Eric-Christopher.
 WORF / What about Alexander?
 TROI / Alexander?
 WORF / He was my son... in another reality.
 WESLEY / (to Worf) I've used a differential pulse to analyze over ten million quantum states within the fissure... but I still haven't found the one with your signature. (beat) This may take some time, sir.
 DATA / Captain -- there is a Bajoran ship approaching.
 RIKER / Red Alert.
 WORF / Sir... the Bajorans?
 RIKER / Ever since the Bajorans overthrew the Cardassian Empire, they've been getting more and more aggressive. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (beat) Yesterday they destroyed one of our subspace telescopes... they thought we were using it to spy on them.
 WESLEY / They're charging their weapons, sir...
 WORF / Shields!
 RIKER / Return fire!
 WESLEY / Captain, they've damaged our power systems -- it's caused an energy surge within the subspace pulse.... (off console) The quantum fissure is beginning to destabilize.
 RIKER / Can you disengage the pulse?
 WESLEY / (off console) Too late, sir.
 RIKER / What the hell's happening?
 DATA / (off console) The barriers between quantum realties are breaking down. Other realties are emerging into our own.
 WESLEY / (off console) The Bajoran ship is disengaging.
 DATA / The rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially. (beat) At this rate, the sector will be completely filled with Enterprises within three days.
 WESLEY / (off console) Sir -- we are receiving two hundred eighty-five thousand hails from other ships.
 RIKER / I wish I knew what to tell them... (beat) Data -- can we stop these incursions?
 DATA / Perhaps -- if we find the ship which matches Commander Worf's quantum signature.
 RIKER / How would that help?
 DATA / It was Worf's shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure and weakened the barriers between quantum realities. If he re-enters the fissure in his original shuttle, and emits a broad-spectrum warp field -- it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities from emerging into our own.
 RIKER / Then what? How do we get the Enterprises that are already here back to where they belong?
 DATA / In theory, the act of sealing the fissure should also restore the barriers between quantum states. (beat) The ships would return to their own realities.
 RIKER / Lieutenant Crusher, send out a general hail to all ships. (to com) This is Captain Riker of the Enterprise... that is, the Enterprise which is indigenous to this universe. We have all encountered a quantum anomaly. We think we have a way to return all of us to our proper realities. We need to find the ship which exhibits a particular quantum signature. Our Mister Data will transmit the signature to you now.
 RIKER / Anything?
 WESLEY / (off console) There's too much com traffic, sir... it's tough to isolate who's talking to who... (beat) Wait. Here it is... one ship is responding...
 RIKER / Onscreen.
 PICARD / Captain... we appear to have the quantum signature you're looking for.
 RIKER / Data believes that by sending Worf through the fissure again, it would send all of us to our own realities.
 PICARD / Our Data has said the same thing.
 RIKER / We need you to send us your shuttlecraft Borges.
 PICARD / (nods) We'll prepare to launch it now.
 RIKER / It's... good to see you again, Captain. It's been a long time.
 RIKER / (re: shuttle) Did they send the right shuttle?
 DATA / Yes. Its quantum signature matches Commander Worf's precisely. (to Worf) I have re-modulated the shuttle's engines to emit an inverse warp field. You will need to activate the field at the precise moment you enter the fissure.
 WORF / Assuming it works... what will happen? Will I find myself near my own ship?
 DATA / That is one possibility. However, the uncertainty principle dictates that time is a variable in this equation. You may end up several days before this event -- or several days after it. There is no way to tell.
 WORF / I understand.
 RIKER / Good luck.
 WORF / (quiet) Goodbye, Deanna.
 WORF / (to com) Setting course for the fissure...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 WESLEY / Captain -- the shuttle is under attack!
 RIKER / The Bajorans again?
 WESLEY / No sir -- it's one of the Enterprises. (beat) They're hailing us.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER ON VIEWSCREEN / (urgent) We won't go back! You don't know what it's like in our universe. The Federation is gone -- the Borg are everywhere! We're one of the last ships left! Please, you've got to help us!
 RIKER / I'm sorry. There's no choice. If this works, everything will return to --
 RIKER ON VIEWSCREEN / No! We won't go!
 WESLEY / They're firing on the shuttle!
 RIKER / Open fire! Try to disable them!
 WESLEY / (off console) Direct hit... their shields have collapsed... their engine core's overloading --
 RIKER / What happened?
 WESLEY / (off console) It looks like their ship had already taken heavy damage -- their warp containment field must have been weak.
 RIKER / Probably from fighting the Borg...
 DATA / (to com) Captain -- Worf is entering the fissure.
 WORF / (to com) Charging primary systems... initiating inverse warp field...
 WORF / (to com) Worf to Enterprise.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Enterprise here.
 WORF / Captain -- is everything alright?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a problem?
 WORF / I do not believe so. But I will explain when I arrive.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / How was the Bat'leth tournament?
 WORF / I won... "Champion Standing."
 RIKER / So you don't think this... quantum fissure is anything we have to worry about?
 WORF / No. I believe the inverse warp field resealed it.
 RIKER / I look forward to reading your report.
 RIKER / Something wrong?
 WORF / I know what you are planning. (off his look) I will not be surprised.
 RIKER / Surprised? I don't know what you're talking about.
 WORF / (wry) Of course you don't.
 TROI / Worf... welcome home.
 TROI / I hope you don't mind I let myself in. I promised Alexander I'd feed his Dalvin hissing beetle while you were both away.
 WORF / So... you do not live here?
 TROI / What is that supposed to mean?
 WORF / It is a... long story.
 TROI / Happy birthday. (beat) Wil wanted to give you a surprise party, but I knew you'd hate it... so I talked him out of it.
 WORF / Thank you.
 TROI / Well... I know Klingons like to be alone on their birthdays. (with humor) I'm sure you have to meditate, or hit yourself with a pain stick or something.
 WORF / Deanna... you do not have to leave.
 TROI / Oh?
 WORF / I have not had dinner. Would you care to... join me?
 TROI / I'd love to.
 PICARD / I don't know why they have to do this every year. In fact, I thought last year the teachers agreed not to do this anymore.
 TROI / Captain Picard Day is one of the children's favorite school activities. They look forward to it all year.
 PICARD / Why does it have to be me?
 TROI / You're the Captain... children look up to you... you're a role model for them.
 PICARD / Their perception of me is a little... exaggerated.
 RIKER / (using doll and imitating voice) "I don't know... I think this bears a certain resemblance. Wouldn't you agree, Number One?"
 PICARD / (to Riker) Don't you have something else to do?
 RIKER / (smiles) I'll be on the Bridge.
 TROI / The finalists will be here in half an hour. You have to pick first, second and third place and four honorable mentions.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain. Incoming transmission from Admiral Blackwell. It is coded priority one.
 PICARD / (to com) Put it through. (to Troi) Excuse me, Counselor.
 PICARD / (continuing) Admiral.
 PICARD / We're conducting an energy output study of the Mekoria Quasar. All systems normal, the ship is fully operational.
 PICARD / I understand. What is our assignment?
 PICARD / Very well.
 PICARD / Oh... yes. It's for the children... I'm a... role model.
 RIKER / So who won the contest?
 PICARD / Paul Menegay -- seven years old. He did an interesting clay sculpture of my head.
 RIKER / Is that the lumpy one with the orange skin?
 PICARD / Yes. (beat) Oh, you'll be interested to know that I've arranged for a Commander Riker day next month. I'm even considering making an entry myself.
 RIKER / (wry) Great.
 PICARD / Energize.
 RIKER / It's... good to see you, sir.
 RIKER / No... it's just been so long and...
 RIKER / (continuing) I'm sorry. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Admiral Erik Pressman.
 PICARD / Pressman? Oh, of course. You were Wil's first commanding officer... on the Pegasus.
 RIKER / Sir?
 PICARD / I remember reading about it. The ship was destroyed by a... warp core breach as I recall.
 RIKER / That's right. The Captain and I, along with seven others managed to get to an escape pod before the breach became critical.
 RIKER / No wreckage was ever found, so Starfleet officially listed the ship as destroyed.
 GEORDI / Why would the Romulans try to salvage pieces of a twelve year-old starship?
 PICARD / What are our orders?
 GEORDI / We'll need metallurgical and chromographic specs on the Pegasus in order to set up the proper search parameters.
 PICARD / Very well. (to Riker) Set course for the Devolin system.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 DATA / We are approaching the Devolin system, Captain.
 PICARD / Any sign of the Romulans?
 DATA / (works) No, sir.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / There's an awful lot of ionizing radiation in this system, Captain. That, combined with the sheer amount of rock is going to slow down our search.
 PICARD / How slow?
 GEORDI / Well, I'd say at least--
 WORF / (urgent) Sir. Romulan Warbird decloaking directly ahead.
 WORF / They're powering weapons.
 RIKER / Red alert. Raise shields. Standby phasers.
 WORF / Sir... they are hailing us.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starship Enterprise.
 PICARD / Not at all. But an... unannounced appearance like this could have unfortunate consequences. It would be a shame if your ship were damaged during such a... misunderstanding.
 PICARD / I could ask you the same question.
 PICARD / How interesting. So are we. Perhaps we could combine our efforts and share our findings.
 PICARD / You are probably right.
 PICARD / Then I won't keep you.
 WORF / They are moving off... resuming their tachyon scans of the system.
 PICARD / Stand down from Red Alert, but continue to track their movements, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) Commander, how long will it take to search the system?
 GEORDI / At least seven days, sir.
 WORF / And the Romulans have a two day head start.
 PICARD / Then we better get to it. Mister Data?
 DATA / (working) Initiating sensor sweep of grid zero one.
 RIKER / About four years. I think I just got tired of hearing how "young" I looked.
 RIKER / (grimaces) Ensign Babyface.
 RIKER / I like to think I've loosened up in my old age.
 RIKER / I've been known to tell a joke or two.
 RIKER / (a little melancholy) We went through some... serious times.
 RIKER / (continuing, quiet) Do you really think we'll find the Pegasus?
 RIKER / And what about our... experiment? Do you think we'll find that too?
 RIKER / You know... I still think about what happened... about that last day.
 RIKER / Do you ever... wonder whether we did the right thing?
 RIKER / I know... but maybe we went about it the wrong way.
 RIKER / (shocked) You want to try again?
 RIKER / Admiral Raner... ? How many other people know about this?
 PICARD / ... as a matter of fact, I never met Wil before he reported aboard at Farpoint Station.
 PICARD / I was looking through the records of about fifty candidates... Wil's was much like all the others... filled with the usual dry statistics and glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I was about to put it aside and go on to the next file, when something caught my eye. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) There had been an incident on Altair Three when Wil was First Officer of the Hood. He refused to let Captain DeSoto beam down during a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and risked a general court martial because he thought he was right. When I read that... I knew I'd found my Number One.
 PICARD / I wanted someone who would stand up to me... someone who was more concerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the mission than with how something looked on his record. To me, that's one of the marks of a good officer.
 PICARD / (gently) I am aware of that, Admiral.
 PICARD / Admiral... the records regarding the loss of the Pegasus are a bit... vague about what happened just before you abandoned ship. Can you add anything to the... official account?
 BEVERLY / What's wrong?
 RIKER / I think I busted a rib.
 BEVERLY / What were you doing?
 RIKER / I was practicing Bat'leth moves with Worf. I jabbed when I should've blocked. He caught me right in the side. I'm glad we were using sticks instead of real blades.
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) It's broken all right. (to Nurse) Give him ten cc's of terakine for the pain.
 RIKER / I can't believe how stupid I was.
 BEVERLY / You both got a little carried away, that's all...
 RIKER / No. It was my fault. I lost focus... I let myself get distracted at a crucial moment.
 BEVERLY / It happens to everyone.
 RIKER / I knew what I was supposed to do... but I didn't do it. If we'd had real Bat'leths I might be dead right now.
 BEVERLY / Wil... it's all right. You made a mistake... no harm done. You'll do better next time.
 RIKER / (downbeat) Yeah... maybe.
 DATA / (off console) Scan of grid one five seven is complete. Moving to grid one five eight.
 WORF / The Romulan ship is still searching grid two seven zero.
 RIKER / They're sure taking their time over there. I wonder if they--
 GEORDI / (excited) Whoa... I think we might have just struck paydirt.
 GEORDI / (continuing) There's a subspace resonance signature coming from this asteroid. (beat) And from the frequency variances, it looks like the pattern from a Federation warp core.
 RIKER / (to com) Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.
 RIKER / (continuing, to Con) Bring us to within ten kilometers of asteroid gamma six zero one. (to Picard) Geordi's found something.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) There's a subspace resonance signature coming from that asteroid, sir. It could be the warp core of the Pegasus.
 PICARD / Put the asteroid on the main viewer.
 DATA / I have confirmed Geordi's readings, sir. The resonance signature is originating from somewhere beneath the asteroid's surface.
 DATA / This asteroid contains several deep chasms large enough for a starship to enter. It is possible the Pegasus drifted into the asteroid's gravitational field and was pulled down into one of the fissures.
 RIKER / Sir, the Romulan warbird has altered course again... they are heading toward our position.
 RIKER / They probably want to see what we're so interested in over here.
 PICARD / Mister Data, how long will it take to determine the exact location of the Pegasus?
 DATA / At least another six hours, Captain.
 RIKER / (to Picard) I recommend we destroy the asteroid. It would take almost all our photon torpedoes, but it would preclude any possibility of the Pegasus falling into Romulan hands.
 RIKER / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data, is it possible to saturate the asteroid with verteron particles? That could mask the resonance signature from the Romulans... prevent them from detecting it.
 DATA / (thinks) In order for the deception to succeed, it would have to appear to be a natural phenomenon. Verteron particles are artificial in nature.
 GEORDI / Wait a minute... we could blanket the asteroid with high levels of ionizing radiation. There's so much of it in this system already, the Romulans won't know the difference.
 PICARD / Data?
 DATA / (beat) Theoretically, it should work..
 RIKER / (off console) If we're going to do it, we have to do it fast... the Romulans will be in sensor range in about a minute.
 PICARD / Make it so, Mister Data.
 DATA / (works) Aye, sir. Initiating an ionization field pulse.
 PICARD / (to Riker) After he's finished, we'll have to move off... make it look like we scanned the asteroid, but didn't find anything.
 RIKER / (to Con) Lay in a course to the next search grid and stand-by to engage.
 PICARD / (to Pressman) If this works, the Romulans won't find anything and we can return later. But if it doesn't...
 DATA / Ionization pulse complete.
 PICARD / Helm, one quarter impulse. Engage.
 DATA / (off console) The Romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid... (beat) They have switched to their lateral sensor array... beginning another scan.
 RIKER / They're certainly being thorough.
 DATA / The Warbird has completed its sensor sweep.
 DATA / They are moving off.
 PICARD / (to Data) Mister Data, we have to convince the Romulans that we're still looking for the Pegasus. I want you to continue scanning this system.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (to Riker) I want to be back at this asteroid at zero eight hundred hours tomorrow. Plot our search pattern accordingly.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to Pressman) Admiral, if you'd care to join me for a late dinner... ?
 PICARD / (nods) Very well. (to Riker) Number One, you have the Bridge. Oh, and will you bring the scan analysis to my quarters when you go off watch?
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / (continuing, to Con) Initiate search of grid one six three.
 DATA / Beginning sensor sweeps...
 RIKER / Mister Data, you have the Bridge.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 RIKER / I thought it was more important to keep the Romulans from--
 RIKER / (tight) No, sir.
 RIKER / I haven't enjoyed it if that's what you mean.
 RIKER / I understand that you think it's necessary.
 RIKER / Changed... ?
 RIKER / A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral.
 RIKER / I'd like to think that I... haven't changed those things, sir.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / (re: PADD) The scan analysis you asked for.
 PICARD / Thank you. Can I interest you in some sashimi?
 RIKER / No, thanks.
 RIKER / Is there anything else, sir?
 PICARD / Yes, there is.
 PICARD / (continuing, reading) "Judge Advocate General's Report. Stardate xxxxx. Subject: Inquiry into Mutiny Aboard USS Pegasus."
 PICARD / (continuing, reading) "Based on testimony from Captain Pressman and other surviving officers, the Judge Advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude that certain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just prior to the destruction of the Pegasus."
 PICARD / (continuing) Mutiny... on a Federation starship. It's shocking -- no, it's unthinkable. And yet you've never mentioned it.
 RIKER / No, sir.
 PICARD / It wasn't easy getting this record. I had to call in a few favors at Starfleet just to get a look at it. It seems the file was sealed by Starfleet Intelligence.
 PICARD / (continuing) So... not only was the Pegasus carrying "sensitive" equipment that can't be allowed to fall into Romulan hands... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / ... not only was there a mysterious explosion which appeared to destroy the ship, but didn't... but now it turns out there was a mutiny on board. (beat) I've read the official report of the mutiny. But I'd like to hear your version of what happened.
 RIKER / I was on the Bridge. The ship was at yellow alert... we were running some... tests on the engines. Something went wrong... there was an explosion in Engineering... heavy casualties. In the middle of the crisis, the First Officer, the Chief Engineer, almost the entire Bridge crew mutinied against Captain Pressman.
 PICARD / Why?
 RIKER / They... felt the Captain was jeopardizing the ship.
 PICARD / And you?
 RIKER / I was seven months out of the Academy... my head was still ringing with words like duty and honor. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (beat) When they moved against him, I thought they were a group of self-serving, disloyal officers. (beat, then quieter) So I grabbed a phaser and defended my captain. Two or three others joined in on our side, but it was clear the mutineers had most of the crew behind them... we felt we had to get off the ship. There was a... running firefight all the way to the escape pod. (beat) About five minutes after we left the ship... there was an explosion...
 PICARD / (reading) "The Judge Advocate also believes that the surviving officers are deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry. Further investigation is recommended." (to Riker) But there was no further investigation... the file was classified and quietly buried. (beat) Why?
 RIKER / Sir... maybe you should take this up with the Admiral.
 PICARD / I'm taking it up with you. The Judge Advocate thought you were participating in a conspiracy to cover-up the truth. That you were lying about what really happened on the Pegasus. Now, I want you to tell me that's not true.
 PICARD / (continuing, harsh) Wil, what the hell's going on here? Why did your crew mutiny? And why is Pressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later?
 RIKER / (formal) I've told you all I can. I am under the direct orders of Admiral Pressman... not to discuss this. Sir.
 PICARD / Very well. He's an admiral, I'm a captain -- I can't force you to disobey him. (beat) I will tell you this... I need to place a great deal of trust in the person who serves as my first officer. You've had that trust... until now. But something is wrong here... and you're part of it. (beat) And when this mission is over... I may have to re-evaluate the command structure of this ship.
 PICARD / (continuing) Dismissed.
 PICARD / Margaret... something's very wrong here. Do you know what's going on?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain Picard. We are approaching asteroid gamma six zero one, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) On my way.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, where are the Romulans?
 WORF / They are out of sensor range on the far side of the system.
 PICARD / (to Con) Bring us to within fifteen kilometers and hold position.
 DATA / For the past several hours, I have been scanning the area where we detected the resonance signature of the Pegasus. From the strength and polarity of the signature, it would appear that most of the warp core is still intact.
 RIKER / So how do we get to it? I wouldn't want to try to transport through that much solid rock.
 PICARD / Agreed. What about a shuttle? We could send it down through one of these fissures.
 DATA / I would recommend against that, sir. There may be gravimetric or magnetic fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower the engines on a shuttlecraft.
 RIKER / You mean into the asteroid?
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / It is theoretically possible, Captain. But I am unaware of any prior situation where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetary body. There may be unforeseen difficulties.
 PICARD / Admiral... I don't think we can risk--
 PICARD / Mister Data, please note in the ship's log that this action is being taken over my explicit objections.
 DATA / It is so noted.
 PICARD / Yellow Alert.
 RIKER / Shields up, inertial dampers to maximum.
 PICARD / Mister Data, plot a course into the chasm... maneuvering thrusters only.
 DATA / (works) Course plotted.
 PICARD / Take us in.
 DATA / (off console) We are now two kilometers beneath the surface.
 WORF / We are encountering shifts in magnetic field density.
 PICARD / (sotto, to Pressman) Admiral, if the passage narrows to less than five hundred meters, I'm going to abort the mission.
 PICARD / (continuing, sotto) You can charge me with insubordination if you wish, but I won't risk the Enterprise for a salvage operation.
 WORF / Sir... I am reading a large resonance signature directly ahead.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / What the hell happened?
 DATA / Sensors show that the ship is still intact... but approximately sixty-five percent of it is contained within the asteroid.
 RIKER / As if half the ship had materialized inside solid rock.
 DATA / Yes, sir. I do not know how this could have happened.
 DATA / (works) The starboard bulkhead of Main Engineering is contained within the rock face... but most of the compartment is still intact.
 WORF / (off console) There is a hull breach in that section.
 PICARD / (to Data) If we begin a power transfer, can you restore life support to that compartment?
 DATA / I believe so. The breach can be temporarily sealed by extending our shields.
 PICARD / Admiral, I'd like to send a complete Away Team to --
 PICARD / Yes, sir.
 RIKER / (nods) The vacuum preserved everything...
 RIKER / (continuing) I wonder how many of the crew are back there...
 RIKER / (quiet) I know. I just kept hoping it wasn't going to be here... that it would've been destroyed or buried back there in the rock...
 RIKER / It means I can't put this off any longer. Right up until this moment, I had the... luxury of time. Now I have to make a choice. (beat) And Admiral... I'm afraid the only choice I can make... is to put a stop to this. I can't let you start these experiments all over again. It was wrong twelve years ago, and it's still wrong today.
 RIKER / That's all that matters to you, isn't it -- starting your experiment again. Look around... we're standing in a room filled with bodies... people who died because of that thing.
 RIKER / You don't know that. Neither of us knows what happened after we left.
 RIKER / No... we killed them.
 RIKER / Yeah, well I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had to do it over again... I'd point that phaser at you instead of them.
 RIKER / I wasn't a hero and neither were you. What you were doing was wrong and I was wrong to support you... I was just too young and stupid to realize it at the time. You were the captain, I was the ensign... and I followed orders.
 RIKER / They were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you from violating a treaty the Federation signed in good faith.
 RIKER / And now you're going to try again. How many people will die this time? Fifty? A hundred? A thousand?
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Away Team. Prepare to return to the ship immediately.
 PICARD / The Romulans fired on the entrance to the chasm with their disruptors... they've sealed us in.
 WORF / Sir... there is an incoming message... it is from the Warbird.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Are you responsible for this?
 PICARD / What is it you want, Sirol?
 RIKER / How?
 PICARD / Thank you for your... generous offer. I will... take it under advisement.
 PICARD / Agreed. Options?
 WORF / We could use the phasers to cut our way out.
 DATA / The asteroid's internal structure is highly unstable. Any attempt to cut through the rock could cause the entire chasm to collapse.
 RIKER / Captain... I have a suggestion. There's a piece of equipment under guard in Admiral Pressman's quarters which could get us out of here. (beat) It's a prototype for a Federation cloaking device.
 PICARD / That's what this is all about? A cloaking device? In the Treaty of Algeron the Federation specifically agreed not to develop cloaking technology.
 PICARD / (hard) That treaty has kept the peace for sixty years. And as a Starfleet officer, you are sworn to uphold it.
 RIKER / (to Pressman) I don't think anyone's going to come to your defense this time.
 PICARD / (to Riker) How can we use the cloak to escape the asteroid?
 RIKER / It's more than just a cloak. It changes the structure of matter... in theory, a ship using this device would be able to pass through normal matter.
 PICARD / (to Pressman) That's why you were so eager to find it...
 PICARD / Except it's illegal... it's a violation of an agreement the Federation signed in good faith.
 RIKER / Captain... we might be able to adapt the cloak for the Enterprise engines and use it to escape the asteroid.
 PICARD / Mister Data?
 DATA / It is theoretically possible, sir. But it will take several hours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 47457.1. We have been trapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours. Mister Data and Commander La Forge inform me that they are nearly ready to engage the cloak.
 GEORDI / (to com) Commander, I've routed the impulse engines through the warp plasma conduits... but you'll have to watch the intercooler levels... if they go too high, we'll blow out the entire relay system.
 RIKER / (to com) Understood. (to Picard) I think that's what happened twelve years ago. The cloak blew out the plasma relays on the Pegasus after we left the ship... the plasma ignited in space, and it looked like the ship had been destroyed.
 RIKER / The cloak failed. And half the ship materialized in solid rock.
 GEORDI / La Forge to Bridge. The cloak is on-line and ready to begin phase sequencing.
 PICARD / Proceed, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir. (he works) Activating power systems...
 PICARD / Report.
 RIKER / The cloak appears to be functioning normally. The ship's matter_energy phasing rate should be sufficient to pass through the asteroid.
 PICARD / (to Conn) Take us out. Maneuvering thrusters only.
 WORF / We will reach the rock face in... five seconds.
 WORF / We have passed through two kilometers of the asteroid... now within one kilometer of the surface.
 RIKER / We're approaching the surface...
 WORF / We have cleared the asteroid, Captain. (reacts to something on console) The Warbird is off the port bow.
 RIKER / They're still waiting for us to make up our minds.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Disengage the cloaking device, Commander.
 PICARD / They'll know the truth, Admiral. Which is what everyone is going to know very shortly. (to Riker) Carry out my orders.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, send a message to the Warbird... inform them that their government will be contacted shortly regarding this incident.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Admiral, I hereby charge you with violation of the Treaty of Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest. Mister Worf?
 WORF / Admiral, if you will come with me...
 PICARD / You're going to need them.
 RIKER / Lieutenant. I'll have to be placed under arrest as well.
 PICARD / I've spoken to Fleet Admiral Shanthi. There will be a full inquiry once we reach Starbase two-four-seven... and it will probably lead to a general court martial of Admiral Pressman and several others at Starfleet Intelligence.
 PICARD / (continuing) Your... involvement in this affair will be thoroughly investigated, Wil... there will be some hard questions for you to answer...
 RIKER / I understand.
 PICARD / You made a mistake twelve years ago... but your service since that time has earned you a great deal of respect... from me and from a great many others. This incident may cost you some of that respect...
 RIKER / I can't help feeling that I should have come forward a long time ago...
 PICARD / When the moment came to make the decision... you made the right one... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / No matter what that choice may have cost you... and no matter how much Pressman may have meant to you... you chose to tell the truth and face the consequences.
 PICARD / (continuing) As long as you can do that... you'll still deserve to wear that uniform... and I'll still be proud to have you as my first officer.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47423.9. We have arrived at Boraal Two in response to an emergency distress call from Lieutenant Worf's foster brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has been stationed on the planet as a cultural observer.
 PICARD and RIKER are at their stations; DATA is at Ops; / WORF is at Tactical; assorted N.D.s man the other / stations. The mood is serious.
 PICARD / Mister Data, analysis.
 DATA / (off console) It appears the planet's atmosphere is dissipating, sir. Intense plasmonic reactions are destroying it.
 PICARD / How far has it progressed?
 DATA / The stratosphere is already breaking down, and there are turbulent radiation storms across much of the surface. (beat) I estimate the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirty-eight hours.
 RIKER / The distress call was only four days ago. Why would Doctor Rozhenko have waited so long before sending it?
 DATA / Atmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictable event. When it occurs, it proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko would not have had much warning.
 PICARD / What was that?
 DATA / (off console) The dissipation effect is generating plasmonic energy bursts...
 RIKER / Are they any danger to the ship?
 DATA / I do not believe so. However, we may experience intermittent system failures and power surges as a result.
 PICARD / Keep an eye on it.
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister Worf. Any luck?
 WORF / There is still no response to our hails, sir... I am attempting to scan the observation post...
 RIKER / (to Picard) He could be hurt... maybe he can't respond...
 WORF / Sensor interference is significant, but the post appears to be intact... its power grid is still functioning...
 WORF / (continuing) However, I am reading no life forms within the structure.
 RIKER / (to Picard) It's hard to believe he would have left the post...
 PICARD / Especially under these circumstances...
 WORF / (off console) Sir, I am detecting faint power emissions from a system of caverns near the post. It could be a deflector shield.
 RIKER / It can't be native to the planet. The Boraalans don't have anything close to that level of technology.
 WORF / Captain. Request permission to lead an Away Team.
 PICARD / Very well. But regardless of this planet's immediate situation, we must still observe the Prime Directive. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) I'd like to minimize the risk of contact with the inhabitants. You're to go alone, Mister Worf -- and I want you surgically altered to pass as a Boraalan.
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 BEVERLY / Worf, you have to try to keep still. I need an accurate scan of your cranial anatomy...
 WORF / I'm sorry, Doctor. Please continue.
 BEVERLY / You're worried about Nikolai, aren't you?
 WORF / (reluctantly) Yes.
 BEVERLY / Are the two of you close?
 WORF / We are... brothers.
 BEVERLY / You've never talked much about him. What's he like?
 WORF / (carefully) Nikolai is older than I... and we are not -- alike. We had many disagreements as we were growing up.
 BEVERLY / That's not unusual.
 WORF / Nikolai... has a mind of his own. He attended Starfleet Academy -- but he was unable to follow the rules. He left after one year. (beat) However, he has many fine qualities. He is... brilliant. Persuasive. A natural leader...
 BEVERLY / Sounds intriguing... I look forward to meeting him.
 WORF / (taps combadge) Worf to Enterprise...
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (fritzed) Go ahead...
 WORF / I am picking up faint life signs approximately two-hundred meters from my position. I am heading toward them.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (fritzed) Understood. The plasmonic interference is getting worse... start checking in every thirty minutes to make sure we have a fix on you.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WORF / My name is Worf. I am a... traveller...
 WORF / Nikolai... ?
 WORF / Please... I must speak with my brother for a moment...
 WORF / (continuing) Nikolai, what have you done?
 WORF / What have you told them?
 WORF / At least you had that much sense...
 WORF / There is nothing we can do for these people. You have only postponed their deaths.
 WORF / I am certain he will want to speak with you.
 WORF / (reluctantly) That is correct.
 PICARD / Doctor, you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipation could not be stopped. What were you hoping to accomplish by assisting these people?
 RIKER / You can't be serious.
 PICARD / I have no intention of compounding what you've already done by committing another gross violation of the Prime Directive.
 TROI / Not entirely. The Prime Directive was designed to ensure non-interference.
 BEVERLY / But aren't we intefering either way? If we take no action, it's a conscious decision to let the Boraalans die.
 PICARD / The Prime Directive is a principle we've all sworn to uphold. Until that is changed, we cannot follow any other course of action. Is that understood?
 PICARD / I'm afraid that won't be possible. You may have full use of the ship's computers to set up a com link and upload your data from here.
 PICARD / (continuing) If there's nothing further, you're dismissed.
 WORF / (gently) Nikolai... I am sorry. I wish there were another way.
 WORF / (continuing, presses on) I am quite familiar with our communications systems. If you wish, I will help you set up your com link.
 DATA / (off console) Captain, the atmospheric dissipation has accelerated over the past several hours. I estimate the planet's atmosphere will be completely gone within four minutes.
 PICARD / Of course.
 DATA / (off console) The mesosphere is gone. Ionic reactions are now beginning to break down the troposphere.
 PICARD / Put it on-screen...
 PICARD / What's going on?
 DATA / It appears that the plasmonic reactions are continuing to interfere with our sensors.
 RIKER / I thought you'd already compensated for that.
 DATA / (puzzled) I had, sir... (beat) I will attempt to engage additional filtering elements...
 DATA / (continuing) Visual re-established.
 PICARD / This is one of the times when we must face the ramifications of the Prime Directive... and honor the lives we cannot save.
 PICARD / Number One, I'll be in my Ready Room. You have the Bridge.
 RIKER / Helm, take us out of orbit. Set course for Starbase eighty-seven, warp five.
 RIKER / What happened?
 DATA / There appears to be an unusual power drain in the EPS distribution net...
 RIKER / What's the source?
 DATA / Unknown, sir... it is difficult to localize.
 WORF / The power drain has registered on my security grid as well, sir... it appears to be coming from deck ten.
 RIKER / (considers) All right, Worf. Get a security team on it.
 WORF / (checks tricorder) Concentrate your scans on the EPS transfer links...
 WORF / Computer. Open Holodeck Five.
 WORF / Override. Authorization, Worf Theta-six-one-nine.
 WORF / What are you doing here?
 WORF / Bridge.
 WORF / (furious) Trust you? You never had any intention of obeying the Captain!
 WORF / Your duty was to respect the Captain's orders and uphold the Prime Directive.
 WORF / You have disgraced yourself... and you have disgraced me. I want nothing more to do with you.
 PICARD / You realize your career is finished.
 PICARD / What do you expect us to do now? You've left us with a colony of Boraalans who think they're still on their planet.
 PICARD / A home which would look very different from Boraal... you can't really believe they'd be fooled...
 PICARD / What if it doesn't work? What if they become aware that something strange is going on?
 PICARD / I'm not enthusiastic about this plan... but I don't see another option. We'll give it a try.
 BEVERLY / There are countless M-class planets in Federation space which could support the Boraalans. We'll have to narrow the parameters.
 DATA / I estimate it will take approximately nine and one half hours to complete the analysis.
 PICARD / And even then there's no guarantee we'll be able to find a suitable planet...
 DATA / That is correct.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Excuse me, Captain... but I think you better take a look at this...
 PICARD / What is it?
 GEORDI / We've got a problem, sir. I don't think it's going to be possible to keep this Holodeck simulation stable.
 PICARD / (concerned) Why not?
 GEORDI / The plasmonic energy surges from the planet have affected some of the ship's systems. We're having problems with the EPS subsystems and the power distribution matrix.
 GEORDI / It's not a question of whether the simulation is going to break down... it's a question of when.
 PICARD / There's no way around it?
 GEORDI / Not while it's running. To fix it, I'd have to shut down all of the Holodecks and re-initialize the entire system.
 PICARD / That would take hours...
 PICARD / Very well. Let's try it. (to Geordi) Monitor the situation closely, Mister La Forge. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / Keep an open com link with the Holodeck so you can be apprised of any problems.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Considering the situation you've put us in, I don't think it's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mister Worf will accompany you.
 WORF / Sir. Perhaps someone else would be a better choice. Counselor Troi is familiar with --
 PICARD / No, the Boraalans already know you. There's no need to introduce anyone new.
 WORF / (reluctant) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Keep a close eye on your brother. I don't want him making the situation any worse than it is.
 WORF / I know a way through the caves. We can travel safely until we return to the surface.
 WORF / As we said, it is far from here. It will not be like the home you knew... even the stars may be different.
 WORF / Do not worry... it is an omen...
 WORF / This is the sign of... La Forge. It is a message to travellers...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / (continuing) It is said that when these lines appear and disappear in a pool of water...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / (continuing) The road ahead will be filled with good fortune...
 GEORDI / (to himself) Hang in there, Worf... just give me a second... (beat) There, that should do it...
 WORF / (disgusted) We are not a "team." I am here because Captain Picard ordered me here.
 WORF / Only because you forced us into it.
 WORF / You have not changed. You still expect others to solve the problems you create.
 DATA / These are the two planets which best match our search criteria...
 DATA / Draygo Four features an unusually large temperate zone. However, it is within three light-years of Cardassian space.
 BEVERLY / There are constant border disputes in that sector...
 DATA / The alternative is Vacca Six. It is located in the Cabral sector...
 BEVERLY / (hopeful) That's pretty isolated...
 DATA / It offers a less hospitable climate than the Boraalans are accustomed to. However, it would still appear to be the better choice.
 DATA / Do you disagree, Doctor?
 BEVERLY / No, Data... you're right. It's just that... the enormity of what we're doing is overwhelming. We're deciding the future of a species.
 DATA / It is a formidable responsibility.
 BEVERLY / There are so many questions we can't answer... what if the climate is so different that it affects them in some way we can't anticipate? Can we even be sure they'll survive? And if they do, how will their society evolve here... and what impact will it have on the Vaccan system? (beat) We have no idea what this decision will mean for their future.
 DATA / I do not believe we can offer any guarantees, Doctor. We can simply make the best choice we have at the moment.
 BEVERLY / Right. (beat) Well, Vacca Six it is, then.
 DATA / (taps combadge) Data to Bridge...
 PICARD / Picard here...
 DATA / We have located a new home for the Boraalans, sir. It is Vacca Six in the Cabral sector.
 RIKER / (to Picard) At maximum warp, we could be there in less than forty-two hours, sir.
 PICARD / Very well. (to helm) Helm. Set course for Vacca Six.
 WORF / What is this?
 WORF / (covering) Not in this manner.
 WORF / We tell each other stories... make up songs...
 WORF / (loudly) We must leave. Gather your belongings.
 WORF / We must stay together. You will have to leave it behind.
 WORF / Go... and return quickly.
 WORF / She is a... fine girl.
 WORF / You will reach your new home... I promise.
 RIKER / All right, everybody... back off...
 TROI / I know things must look very strange to you... but everything's going to be fine. No one is going to hurt you...
 TROI / (continuing) We're friends of Nikolai and Worf... Don't be afraid...
 TROI / Yes, he is my friend... and that means you are, too. I promise I won't hurt you...
 BEVERLY / I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do... his neural physiology is unusual. I can't wipe his memory.
 PICARD / I see... (long beat) How is he?
 BEVERLY / As well as can be expected. I gave him a mild sedative, and Deanna's been talking to him the whole time. He's calmed down a lot.
 PICARD / Does he understand the situation?
 BEVERLY / I think so.
 PICARD / All right. Get in touch with Mister Worf... make sure he knows what's happened.
 TROI / This is Captain Picard.
 PICARD / Vorin, isn't it?
 PICARD / Your planet was dying... it could no longer support life. So we took you away from it.
 PICARD / We have the ability to create the... illusion of other places, like the caves on your planet. You have actually been on this starship for the last two days... not on Boraal.
 TROI / (beat) Yes.
 PICARD / Vorin. Listen to me. We can travel to many worlds. We will take you to one where your people can build a new life...
 PICARD / A chance... for your people... your culture... to survive and grow.
 WORF / I will carry this. Go join the others...
 WORF / Vorin has left the Holodeck.
 WORF / I don't know. But Doctor Crusher cannot erase his memory.
 WORF / They have explained the situation to him... he must make his own decision.
 WORF / That is his right. He's not a prisoner.
 WORF / You should've considered that before you beamed them aboard!
 WORF / But you never think about the consequences of your acts.
 WORF / Wherever you go, you create chaos. How many times did our parents lie awake at night, wondering what kind of trouble you were in?
 WORF / I was not perfect -- but I was not wild and disobedient.
 WORF / I would rather be accused of that -- than of making our mother weep.
 WORF / (continuing) But it is clear you have no intention of changing. I see no reason to discuss it further.
 WORF / Commander, the Holodeck malfunctions are increasing...
 GEORDI / I'm running every stabilization routine I know...
 WORF / How much longer until we reach the new planet?
 GEORDI / We'll be there in less than eight hours... You just have to hold things together a little while longer...
 WORF / (to com) Someone is coming...
 WORF / Of course.
 WORF / It is an... old argument.
 WORF / No. I do not.
 WORF / Us?
 DATA / We are in synchronous orbit above the beam-down site, sir.
 PICARD / Good. (to com) Mister La Forge. How much longer before we can transport the Boraalans?
 GEORDI / (worried) A few more hours, sir... but we've got some problems here.
 GEORDI / (continuing) I don't think the Holodeck's going to last that long. We've had materialization errors and resolution failures all over the place -- and it's getting worse. The simulation could fall apart any minute.
 PICARD / (to com) We'll have the Transporter room standing by... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / We may need to transport the Boraalans whether you're ready or not. Keep Mister Worf apprised of the situation.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (continuing) Commander, you have the Bridge... We still have one more problem to worry about...
 PICARD / Vorin. We've arrived at the planet I told you about... (beat) Have you made a decision?
 PICARD / I see. (beat) And what do you intend to tell them?
 PICARD / If you tell them the truth -- what will happen? Will they believe you?
 PICARD / It's possible they'll think you had an hallucination... or even that you're insane...
 PICARD / On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. They would learn about alien worlds and starships...
 PICARD / You can stay here. Make a future for yourself... with us.
 WORF / How could you have mated with a Boraalan? What were you thinking?
 WORF / As usual, you are thinking only of yourself.
 WORF / You have treated Dobara with dishonor.
 WORF / That is impossible -- I cannot allow you to stay here.
 WORF / Yes. But everyone must take shelter in the tents.
 WORF / Commander... it might help if you could produce a storm...
 WORF'S COM VOICE / ... wind, lightning and thunder.
 GEORDI / I'll see what I can do...
 WORF / (to com) Commander... Energize...
 WORF / The storms will not return.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47427.2. The Boraalans have safely reached the site of what will eventually become their new village. None of them suspects they ever left their planet. However, our success has come at a high price...
 BEVERLY / I think it was some form of ritual suicide...
 PICARD / He said he had nowhere to go...
 BEVERLY / He'd have died even if we hadn't interfered...
 PICARD / But he wouldn't have died alone... and afraid...
 BEVERLY / Are you saying you're sorry we saved the Boraalans?
 PICARD / No, of course not. Our plan worked out well for them...
 PICARD / (continuing) But I wish Vorin could have bridged the gap between our cultures. I would have liked the chance to know him better.
 WORF / I don't want to fight you, Nikolai.
 WORF / No.
 WORF / If you'd been more like me -- those people would not be here now. You gave them a chance at a new life.
 WORF / You were never good at drawing... how will you keep a chronicle?
 WORF / Then perhaps there is hope...
 WORF / (continuing) May I take this with me?
 WORF / I will attempt to explain all this to mother and father.
 WORF / They may. I will tell them... you are happy.
 A traditional FUNERAL is in progress. A large group of MOURNERS, dressed in black, are gathered around a COFFIN. The setting is a SUNNY clearing surrounded by a large HEDGE. Stone-carved TOMBSTONES and other traditional graveyard details can be seen. PICARD and TROI are there, as well -- wearing their dress / uniforms.
 BEVERLY is standing at the head of the coffin, speaking / to the group. It's a eulogy, and Beverly speaks with great fondness.
 BEVERLY / (to all) Most people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a "healer"... but her abilities went beyond that. She didn't just relieve pain, or fight illness... because she knew that well-being is more than a healthy body. Her remedies included words of advice as often as they did medicinal teas... (smiles) And sometimes they were just as bitter-tasting.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) But Nana's favorite thing was cooking. My most vivid memories growing up were of Nana in the kitchen... the sounds of bubbling pots and wooden spoons... the exotic tastes and smells... (beat) In fact, she was in the middle of writing a cook book when she died. I'd like to share with you one of her recipes... it was my favorite.
 BEVERLY / (reads) "Nana's Gingerbread. Mix one gram currants... six hundred milliliters of flour... two hundred milliliters buttermilk... and a dollop of molasses... " (beat) "Two pinches of ginger and cinnamon... and two hundred milliliters of sugar."
 BEVERLY / (continuing, reads) "Heat the oven until it's happy... then pour the batter into the arms of a welcoming pan... " (an aside) I never knew when an oven was happy, and I never saw arms on a pan... but it sure tasted great.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I'll miss Felisa Howard very much... her healing... her advice... and most of all, her gingerbread.
 PICARD / Just a few more hours. Why?
 PICARD / We're due at Starbase six-two-one tomorrow morning... but we can delay that for a few days. Yes... I'm sure we can find some time.
 PICARD / I look forward to that tour. The Caldos Colony is really an impressive accomplishment. I actually feel like I'm in the Scottish Highlands.
 PICARD / I'm curious, Governor... you're obviously not from Scotland. What drew you here?
 TROI / I thought it was a beautiful eulogy, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / Thank you.
 BEVERLY / You know, I never realized how many friends Nana had...
 TROI / Did you come home often?
 BEVERLY / Not really. After I married Jack and moved to Earth... I never seemed to get back here...
 BEVERLY / Deanna... did you notice a peculiar man at the service? He looked like he was in his midthirties... dark hair?
 TROI / No...
 BEVERLY / He threw a flower on Nana's grave... a camellia... it was her favorite flower. She used to keep them all over the house.
 TROI / Maybe he was a friend... or one of her patients.
 BEVERLY / Maybe. It was just such a personal gesture... and he gave me the oddest look...
 BEVERLY / Well... I suppose I should go back to the house. There are some things there I'd like to take care of. (beat) It's only a few minutes away. Would you mind coming along?
 TROI / I'd love to.
 TROI / (re: photograph) Your grandmother had remarkable green eyes...
 BEVERLY / Every woman in the Howard family has had green eyes... except for my mother and me.
 TROI / How well do you remember your mother?
 BEVERLY / Not very well... I was so young when she died. I just have the image of her face... and I can hear the sound of her voice, but I can't tell you anything specific she ever said... (beat) Mostly, I remember Nana.
 TROI / (re: candle) That's beautiful... what is it?
 BEVERLY / A family heirloom... it's been in the Howard clan for at least twenty generations. It's supposed to symbolize the "enduring spirit of the Howards, wherever they may go -- a shining light to guide their fortune." (smiles) Nana always kept it lit. I can remember sitting in here listening to ghost stories with only this candle burning...
 TROI / You should take it with you...
 BEVERLY / I think I will.
 TROI / Well... I'm going to head back to the ship.
 BEVERLY / You don't have to go.
 TROI / Something tells me you'd like some time alone. (smiles) I'll see you later.
 BEVERLY / Thanks.
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Who's there?
 BEVERLY / What the hell are you doing?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Get out of my house.
 BEVERLY / How do you know who I am?
 BEVERLY / Nana never mentioned you...
 BEVERLY / What do you mean?
 BEVERLY / Now listen, Mister Quint -- I don't know what your relationship was with my grandmother. But this is my house now and these are my things --
 BEVERLY / (hard) This is a family heirloom and I intend to keep it. I would like you to leave my house. Now.
 DATA is working at a console while Governor Maturin / looks on. The wall monitor displays an Okudagram of the CALDOS COLONY. GEORDI and various N.D.s can be seen working in the b.g.
 DATA / The colony's (TECH) systems are functioning normally... as are the (TECH) systems.
 DATA / Certainly.
 GEORDI / Governor... did you know you had a power fluctuation in your weather control system?
 GEORDI / I can't isolate the exact source, but the fluctuation seems to be originating from one of the substations that regulates atmospheric humidity for the colony.
 GEORDI / Not yet... but power distribution patterns are already off by five percent.
 DATA / I suggest we analyze the planet's weather patterns to see if they have been affected.
 DATA / (continuing, off console) I am reading unusually high humidity across the entire Southern desert region... and there is increasing cloud activity over the Northern coastal area... possibly the formation of a storm system.
 GEORDI / (to Data) Data, let's see if we can correct this. I'll check out the colony's climatic flow array.
 DATA / And I will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators.
 GEORDI / Don't worry, Governor. We'll keep you dry.
 BEVERLY / (re: book) You wouldn't believe what I've been reading about in my grandmother's journals...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) You know she had a lover? Can you believe it? Nana was a hundred years old.
 PICARD / It would seem the Howard women have exceptionally... vigorous libidos.
 BEVERLY / I certainly hope so. I'd like to think that I could find a young, handsome man in his thirties when I pass the century mark.
 PICARD / (reacts) Thirties?
 BEVERLY / Yes. According to her journal, his name is Ronin... and he's thirty-four years-old. She met him just after my great-grandmother died. And I think I saw him at the funeral. He threw a camellia onto her grave. (beat) The strange thing is, Nana never mentioned him to me in her letters... never once. And they apparently spent almost all of their time together... (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / (beat) It's like she led a whole life I never knew about.
 PICARD / Well... it looks like we're going to be at Caldos for a few more days. This might give you a chance to get your grandmother's affairs in order.
 BEVERLY / Thank you. I will.
 TROI / You dreamt you were in bed with someone?
 BEVERLY / Not exactly. I was in bed... but there wasn't another person in the dream... it was more like a presence...
 TROI / You said you felt a touch...
 BEVERLY / (nods) A pair of hands. They were moving across my skin...
 TROI / Like a caress?
 BEVERLY / Yes. And I heard a voice... a man... he whispered my name... (beat) It was almost like I knew him... or more like he knew me. He knew exactly how I liked to be touched... (beat) It was the most... physical dream I've ever had. The sensations were so real...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) And extremely... arousing.
 TROI / Frankly, I'm envious.
 BEVERLY / (lightly) I did fall asleep reading a particularly erotic chapter in my grandmother's journal. She wrote very detailed descriptions about her experiences with Ronin.
 TROI / That's bound to cause a dream or two.
 TROI / (continuing) So... should we start going over the personnel reports?
 BEVERLY / You know, I think I even felt a ring on one of the hands... when it touched my shoulder... and my neck. (beat) I wonder if I'll have another dream tonight...
 TROI / (lightly) I'd read two chapters.
 BEVERLY / No... it's okay. (beat) Look, I'm sorry we got off to such a bad start yesterday. I've been reading my grandmother's journals... and I know how much you meant to her.
 BEVERLY / Ned... you're welcome to stay on at the house after I'm gone. I'll need someone to take care of it.
 BEVERLY / Why?
 BEVERLY / Haunted?
 BEVERLY / Ned, I never said that...
 BEVERLY / I grew up in that house. I loved that house.
 BEVERLY / Are you suggesting my grandmother didn't die of natural causes?
 BEVERLY / Why not?
 BEVERLY / Ned -- the weather control system is malfunctioning. The Enterprise is trying to fix it...
 BEVERLY / I think your imagination is --
 WORF / Captain -- I am detecting atmospheric turbulence over the colony... and large pockets of electrical activity.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / That's one hell of a thunderstorm.
 PICARD / (to com) Bridge to Engineering. Mister Data, we're reading an extremely large storm system over the Caldos Colony. It was my understanding that the weather control malfunction was not severe.
 DATA / (to com) It began as a minor power fluctuation, sir -- but the effect has spread throughout the control grid. (off console) It has caused unusual concentrations of cumulonimbus activity above the colony.
 GEORDI / (to com) Captain, I suggest we set up a power transfer between the Enterprise and the weather substations -- try to give them enough power to stabilize the storm.
 PICARD / Make it so. (to Riker) In the meantime, Number One -- contact Governor Maturin. Tell him to expect some... rough weather.
 BEVERLY / (calls out) Who's there?
 BEVERLY / (continuing, calls out) Ned, is that you? Hello... ?
 BEVERLY / (calls out) I know somebody's here... now I suggest you --
 BEVERLY / (continuing, calls out) Alright... that's it. Whoever you are, show yourself right now or I'm going to call the Enterprise and have ten security guards down here in the next thirty seconds.
 BEVERLY / Who are you?
 BEVERLY / (firm) No... that was a dream... (beat) I'm calling the Enterprise.
 BEVERLY / Yes, but... what's happening to me... I feel... strange...
 BEVERLY / Are you... Ronin?
 BEVERLY / Who... are you?
 BEVERLY / (weak) But I don't believe in...
 BEVERLY / So you're telling me that you're an eight hundred year-old ghost...
 BEVERLY / And now you're here... on Caldos... two hundred light years away?
 BEVERLY / I don't believe you...
 BEVERLY / Wait -- what's happening...
 BEVERLY / I don't understand... stop...
 BEVERLY / Come in.
 TROI / Hi, Bev. I just wanted to see if you were going to mok'bara class this morning.
 BEVERLY / No... I think I'm going to skip it today. I'm exhausted.
 TROI / Did you have another dream last night?
 BEVERLY / Not exactly...
 TROI / Is anything wrong?
 BEVERLY / Not at all. I'm just a little tired.
 TROI / Beverly... if I didn't know any better, I'd say you're seeing someone.
 BEVERLY / Deanna...
 TROI / Oh, now I know you're seeing someone.
 BEVERLY / I'm not... "seeing" anybody. I met someone, that's all...
 TROI / Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for him... (lightly) Beverly, you should realize by now you can't fool me. Who is it?
 BEVERLY / Alright... the truth is, I met Ronin.
 TROI / (surprised) Ronin? Your grandmother's lover?
 BEVERLY / I know, I know... it sounds crazy. But he's unlike anyone I've ever met before. (beat) I've never known anyone who's so... passionate. It's like he brings every part of me alive. He's very...
 TROI / Sensual?
 BEVERLY / Yes. Exactly. I can see why Nana fell in love with him...
 BEVERLY / You must think this is pretty strange...
 TROI / I will admit, it's unusual... but I'm very happy for you. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / (beat) But I do want you to consider something. You and Ronin have both experienced a tremendous loss. Very often a shared traumatic experience can create the illusion of closeness... and romance.
 BEVERLY / I appreciate the concern, but I think I know what I'm doing. Besides, I didn't say I was in love with him. I'm just... intrigued.
 PICARD / (shocked) What the hell is going on?
 DATA / (scanning) It appears to be a concentrated suspension of water vapor, approximately one degree Celsius.
 PICARD / Fog?
 RIKER / It just sort of... rolled in on us, sir.
 WORF / (to Picard) There has been a malfunction in the ship's environmental controls.
 RIKER / We've traced the problem to the power transfer beam -- we're getting some sort of feedback from one of the colony's weather substations.
 WORF / Captain -- the temperature in Ten Forward has dropped below freezing... and Deck Nineteen has just lost gravity.
 PICARD / Mister Data -- disengage the power transfer.
 DATA / I am unable to terminate the connection, sir. A feedback loop has formed in the transfer beam. (beat) I will have to go to the substation and attempt to correct the problem from there.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 PICARD / (continuing) In the meantime, I think I'll get my jacket.
 DATA / It appears that the station is experiencing a system-wide power failure.
 GEORDI / How's that possible? The back-up systems should have --
 GEORDI / Data -- I think I just found the problem...
 DATA / (to Quint) You are dismantling the primary power conduit. I must ask you to stop.
 DATA / (off tricorder) He is dead.
 GEORDI / From what I can tell, he was trying to shut down the entire weather control system... (beat) He was pulling out the primary plasma conduit... that's probably what caused the plasma discharge that killed him.
 GEORDI / It'll take some time to get the system back on-line... I'd say we need another day, at least.
 DATA / In the meantime, Governor, you should expect the weather problems to continue.
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Commander Data -- you'd better take a look at this.
 BEVERLY / (to Data) Data, you said you saw a plasma discharge coming from the console when Quint was killed...
 DATA / That is correct.
 BEVERLY / Well, that's not what killed him. (off tricorder) I'm detecting an anomalous energy residual throughout his body... all the way down to the cellular level. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / Whatever it is, it's definitely not the result of a plasma discharge.
 GEORDI / Anything?
 DATA / I cannot identify the energy residual. However, it appears to have the same anaphasic signature as the power fluctuations we observed in the weather control system.
 GEORDI / Then it's possible that whatever caused the weather malfunctions also killed Quint...
 DATA / It is possible.
 GEORDI / (to Data) We should scan the colony for any energy readings that match this anaphasic signature.
 BEVERLY / (to Maturin) Governor, with your permission, I'd like to take the body back to the ship to run a few more tests.
 BEVERLY / (to N.D.) Ensign, have Doctor Selar run a bio-spectral analysis.
 BEVERLY / No. There are some things I have to attend to...
 BEVERLY / (calls out) Ronin... I have to talk to you... are you here?
 BEVERLY / (smiles) Yes.... (beat) But... I must talk to you. There's been an accident...
 BEVERLY / Do you know what happened? What was he trying to do?
 BEVERLY / Ronin... I've got to know. Quint's dead...
 BEVERLY / Ronin?
 BEVERLY / Help you?
 BEVERLY / Quint said it was your home... is that true?
 BEVERLY / The candle is on my ship... I'll go get it...
 BEVERLY / How... ?
 BEVERLY / After I light the candle, then what?
 BEVERLY / Computer, secure door.
 BEVERLY / (continuing, calls out) I lit the candle... where are you?
 BEVERLY / Yes... more than anything.
 PICARD / (re: PADD) Beverly... what the hell is this?
 BEVERLY / I thought it was pretty self-explanatory. I'm leaving Starfleet. (to Chief) Energize.
 PICARD / Belay that order. (to Beverly) Beverly, you can't just... resign.
 BEVERLY / I can -- and I have. I've decided to stay on Caldos and become a healer, like my grandmother. It's a proud Howard tradition, and I've decided to uphold it. (to Chief) Energize.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I've resigned my commission. Now unless you plan on kidnapping me...
 TROI / Beverly was attracted to Ronin in a very... intense and intimate way. I warned her that they had both experienced a recent loss... but she seemed very defensive about it... so I left her alone. (beat) I could sense she was holding something back... she wasn't telling me the whole truth...
 PICARD / Do you think this Ronin may be exerting some sort of influence on her... that she may be staying because of him?
 TROI / It's possible. She may really believe she's in love...
 PICARD / It's a rash decision... ill-considered... not like Beverly at all.
 TROI / I agree. But she does have the right to make that choice, even if we feel it's a bad one.
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / Captain, Geordi and I have detected an energy residual with the same anaphasic signature as the one we found in Ned Quint's body.
 PICARD / Where?
 DATA / Approximately seventeen kilometers from the center of the colony. (beat) It is coming from the cemetery, sir.
 PICARD / I want you to go down to the cemetery... see if you can pinpoint the source.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 PICARD / (to Troi) In the meantime, I would very much like to meet this... Ronin.
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) The energy readings are coming from this area, but I can't get an exact location. I'll try to narrow the scan field...
 DATA / The energy readings appear to be originating approximately eight meters below the surface.
 DATA / (re: grave) I believe they are concentrated within this burial site.
 BEVERLY / I'm so glad you're here... right now I can't imagine what life was like before I met you.
 BEVERLY / Ronin... I had no idea I could feel this way...
 BEVERLY / (to Ronin) I love you...
 PICARD / Beverly...
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc...
 PICARD / I'm sorry for startling you. I knocked, but there was no answer.
 BEVERLY / (on edge) What do you want?
 PICARD / I hoped to meet your new friend... Ronin.
 BEVERLY / He's... not here.
 PICARD / Oh. Well, if you don't mind I'll wait. I'm anxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not only one, but two of the Howard women.
 BEVERLY / (an edge) Jealousy doesn't become you, Jean-Luc.
 PICARD / Beverly... did you change the color of your eyes?
 BEVERLY / Yes... I just got tired of the old color. Don't you think this suits me?
 PICARD / I think I liked your eyes the way they were before... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / I think I liked you the way you were before, Beverly.
 BEVERLY / Well, this is the way I am now. This is my life. I've made my decision and I'm not going to change my mind, so please leave me alone.
 PICARD / No... there's something's wrong here. This is about more than just an obsessive love affair that's gotten out of hand... (beat) Why is it that no one has seen this Ronin except you?
 PICARD / So, you're Ronin... it's a pleasure to meet you. Where are you from?
 PICARD / How long have you been here on Caldos?
 PICARD / That's a very... romantic notion. Especially for two people who have just met. Don't you think perhaps you're rushing into things a bit?
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data to Picard.
 PICARD / (to com) Go ahead.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Captain, we have located the source of the energy residual. It appears to be concentrated within Felisa Howard's coffin.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / Captain, we'd like permission to exhume the body.
 PICARD / Why? What are you afraid of?
 PICARD / (to com) Mister Data, contact Governor Maturin and ask for permission to exhume the body. Picard out.
 PICARD / Go ahead. But I'll be surprised if the governor knows who you are. He'll probably have the same questions I do. How did you come to Caldos? What ship did you arrive on?
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, leave him alone --
 PICARD / (hard) Answer the question, Ronin. What ship? I'd like to look at the passenger list. (pressing on) Where have you been living here on Caldos? What's your position here? Who are your neighbors?
 PICARD / (continuing, quickly) Come on, Beverly -- we have to get out of here.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc...
 BEVERLY / We can't leave him... he'll die.
 BEVERLY / No... no, I can't just let him die...
 BEVERLY / No... no!
 PICARD / I'm alright... (beat) Beverly... you must go after him... go to the cemetery...
 GEORDI / (taps combadge) La Forge to Enterprise -- we're ready down here.
 DATA / (off tricorder) I am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body -- it appears to extend to the cellular level.
 GEORDI / How's that possible? She wasn't anywhere near the weather station when Quint was killed... she died of natural causes...
 DATA / I suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for --
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Stop -- NO!
 BEVERLY / Ronin -- stop this... please...
 BEVERLY / (angry) You're not Nana... Nana's dead. Leave her alone.
 BEVERLY / No... I won't let you hurt my friends.
 BEVERLY / No, it won't. I scanned myself with the tricorder. You've been infusing me with the same anaphasic energy that killed Quint...
 BEVERLY / No, you're not. There's no such thing as a ghost... you're some sort of... anaphasic lifeform... (beat) Anaphasic energy is extremely unstable... without an organic host to maintain your molecular cohesion, you'd die... isn't that right?
 BEVERLY / (pressing on) I scanned the candle, too... the flame is plasma-based... you were using it as a temporary receptacle for yourself... until you could get to me... so you could "merge" with me...
 BEVERLY / You've been using me... Nana... my whole family... for centuries...
 BEVERLY / No...
 BEVERLY / (quickly, to com) Crusher to Riker. Wil -- I want you to shut down all plasma conduits in the weather control system. I'll explain later.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Understood.
 BEVERLY / (to Ronin) You've got nowhere left to go...
 BEVERLY / Keep away from me...
 BEVERLY / Somehow he realized that one of my ancestors had a biochemistry that was compatible with his energy matrix... (beat) I imagine he took human form and seduced her the same way he did me. He had some sort of hypnotic... almost telepathic control.
 BEVERLY / It's strange... I was about to be initiated into a very unusual relationship... I guess you could call it a family tradition. And there's a part of me that's a little sad...
 TROI / How so?
 BEVERLY / I re-read the entries in my grandmother's journals. Whatever else he might have done... he made her very happy.
 TROI and RIKER are sitting at a table looking over a / PADD. The usual complement of N.D's fill the room.
 RIKER / Fletcher has more experience with propulsion systems --
 TROI / But Carstairs is better with people. Considering this is a supervisory position, I'd go with her.
 RIKER / (considers) You're probably right...
 RIKER / (continuing) Didn't we just finish a Crew Evaluation Report?
 TROI / (smiles) That was three months ago.
 RIKER / Feels like three weeks. Maybe we should just give everyone a promotion and call it a night. (smiles) What do you say... Commander?
 TROI / (smiles) Fine with me... Captain.
 RIKER / I've been thinking about who to promote to Ops --
 TROI / The new night duty officer?
 RIKER / (acknowledges) Lavelle's an obvious candidate, but I'm considering Ensign Sito as well.
 TROI / Yes. Don't tempt me.
 At Red Alert, Sito is at Tactical, Lavelle at the Conn, DATA at Ops -- Riker is giving a series of rapid-fire / orders from the Command Area. Various N.D's as needed.
 RIKER / Lock phasers on target --
 DATA / (off console) The enemy vessel is firing.
 RIKER / Helm, hard to starboard!
 RIKER / Fire phasers!
 DATA / Target is destroyed.
 RIKER / End simulation sequence and secure from drill.
 RIKER / (continuing, to all) Alpha shift, your response time was seven percent slower than gamma shift --
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I'd like all departments to submit drill evaluation reports by oh nine hundred hours --
 GEORDI / Ensign, you'll write that report.
 RIKER / Let's see if we can find a way to close that gap.
 RIKER / (continuing) What happened back there, Ensign?
 RIKER / Next time try letting the locking relay float until the actual order to fire is given.
 RIKER / (continuing) They may not teach that trick at the Academy, but it works.
 RIKER / Lavelle...
 RIKER / Resume previous course and speed.
 RIKER / One "aye" is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign.
 PICARD / Helm, change course for the Argaya system -- maximum warp.
 RIKER / What about our rendezvous with the Clement?
 PICARD / I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss it in the Observation Lounge.
 RIKER / Ensign Sito, you'll fill in at Ops.
 GEORDI / Sure. What is it?
 GEORDI / Have you been improvising again, Ensign?
 GEORDI / You've got a problem right here... the plasma flow in the nacelles is out of sync.
 GEORDI / (off console) You're right...
 GEORDI / I know his work, but I never heard anything about this...
 GEORDI / I'll look forward to reading about it...
 GEORDI / Sounds interesting.
 GEORDI / I don't know... There could be variables you didn't account for.
 GEORDI / I'm sure you were... but I'd like to look over your simulation before I authorize any tests.
 GEORDI / If you have any other ideas for improving efficiency, feel free to run them by me.
 GEORDI / I'll get back to you on that...
 BEVERLY / If you're wondering about your evaluation, it couldn't be better.
 BEVERLY / In fact, I'm recommending you for a promotion. How does Lieutenant Alyssa Ogawa sound to you?
 BEVERLY / I'll talk to Commander Riker... I expect it'll be official as soon as the current crew evaluation is over.
 BEVERLY / Alyssa... I've been meaning to ask you -- how are things going with you and Lieutenant Powell?
 BEVERLY / You think?
 BEVERLY / I see...
 BEVERLY / I can understand that. Sometimes I get so absorbed in my research I forget to eat.
 BEVERLY / What?
 BEVERLY / You do seem well-suited.
 BEVERLY / (carefully) I'm not sure exactly what you mean...
 BEVERLY / Alyssa... I think you may be overreacting.
 BEVERLY / If I felt as strongly about someone as you do about Andrew -- he'd have to do a lot more than cancel one date before I became suspicious.
 BEVERLY / As soon as this research project is over... I'm sure things will be just like they were.
 WORF / Ops is a very different challenge from Tactical.
 WORF / I recommended you.
 RIKER / (a greeting) Ben...
 RIKER / Lavelle...
 RIKER / (continuing) Can I do something for you?
 RIKER / Something wrong with that one?
 RIKER / Trakian Ale.
 RIKER / Really...
 RIKER / A grandfather?
 RIKER / No. I grew up in Alaska.
 RIKER / We're holding position in the Argaya System.
 PICARD / Anything?
 WORF / (off console) No, sir. I detect no vessels in the vicinity.
 PICARD / How close are we to the Cardassian border?
 DATA / (off console) Less than five thousand kilometers.
 WORF / (off console) Sir... I am detecting an object... five meters in length. (beat) It appears to be an escape pod.
 RIKER / They must have been forced to abandon ship.
 PICARD / How far inside Cardassian space is it?
 WORF / Over fifty thousand kilometers.
 PICARD / How the hell are we going to get it out of there... ?
 DATA / (off console) Sir, the pod's life-support system is failing.
 RIKER / (to Worf) Notify Doctor Crusher --
 PICARD / Can we get within Transporter range without crossing into Cardassian territory?
 DATA / (works) We would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by at least seven percent.
 PICARD / (to com) Mister La Forge?
 GEORDI / I'm on it, sir.
 GEORDI / (continuing, to Taurik) Try it now...
 GEORDI / I'm going to try augmenting the frequency spread...
 GEORDI / (sharp) No one asked you to do that, Ensign. Let's just get him aboard safely.
 GEORDI / (continuing) There, that should do it...
 GEORDI / (hits combadge) Transporter room -- you should be able to get a lock now.
 PICARD / (to com) Doctor, are you ready?
 BEVERLY / (hits combadge) Stand by.
 BEVERLY / Alyssa, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
 BEVERLY / (to com) Transporter room. go ahead.
 PICARD / Ensign...
 RIKER / Twelve hundred hours -- alpha shift is relieved...
 RIKER / Now's not the best time.
 PICARD / Ensign, you're with me.
 PICARD / Bridge.
 PICARD / (continuing) You're a certified pilot, aren't you?
 PICARD / How long have you served on the Enterprise?
 PICARD / I see... I understand you've been recommended for the Ops position. Do you think you're up to it?
 PICARD / I'm not so sure. Your record concerns me.
 PICARD / The incident you were involved in at the Academy.
 PICARD / (interrupting) I'm not certain it matters how long it's been. What I need to know is whether you would ever do something like that again.
 PICARD / (cutting her off) A dare-devil stunt? I should hope not. What concerns me more is that you participated in a coverup that impeded an official investigation into the death of a cadet.
 PICARD / But you didn't. You went along with the others and pretended that what happened was nothing more than an accident. What do you suppose that tells me about your character?
 PICARD / I'm very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at the Academy, Ensign. But as far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelled for what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it onto my ship.
 PICARD / You're dismissed...
 GEORDI / Two more seconds... (beat) That's enough.
 GEORDI / We're evaluating hull resiliency. Starfleet requires periodic testing.
 GEORDI / (somewhat pointedly) Probably because you're not a senior officer.
 GEORDI / It's fine the way it is. Just give me a four second burst right about here.
 GEORDI / Actually... (he gestures) Make it over there.
 GEORDI / Consistent with what?
 GEORDI / What makes you think that's what we're doing?
 GEORDI / That's quite a coincidence...
 GEORDI / Yes, Ensign. Thank you.
 BEVERLY / Alyssa... thanks for coming so quickly.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) We need to prepare for surgery. We have a comatose patient with a subdeural hematoma.
 BEVERLY / I want to make it clear that you are not to discuss what you see here with anyone.
 BEVERLY / We'll need to synthesize at least a liter of Cardassian blood...
 WORF / (bets) Twenty.
 BEVERLY / -- the thing is, I saw Powell in Ten Forward with another woman... the way they were talking made me wonder...
 TROI / He should tell Alyssa if he's seeing someone else. Even if it hurts her, it'll be better in the long run.
 RIKER / I've been meaning to tell you something, Worf... I don't think Ensign Sito is ready for the Ops position.
 WORF / I must say that I disagree, sir.
 RIKER / I'm listening...
 WORF / (to Riker) It is your decision, sir -- but if you give her a chance to prove herself, I feel certain that Ensign Sito will not disappoint you.
 RIKER / All right, Worf. I'll keep her under consideration. (beat) Besides, I have my doubts about Lavelle.
 TROI / (surprised) Really? Why?
 RIKER / He's too... eager to please. He keeps trying to ingratiate himself to me.
 TROI / Why assume he's doing it just to get the job?
 RIKER / (to Geordi) I'll see your fifty and raise you a hundred.
 TROI / I don't know... It seems to me that you and Lavelle have a lot in common.
 RIKER / What? We're not at all alike.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) You're bluffing.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) Looks like it's just you and me, buddy. You in for another fifty?
 GEORDI / Give me a minute. I'm thinking.
 TROI / (to Riker) Didn't you tell me you took up poker so you could get into the officer's game on the Potemkin?
 RIKER / I happen to like poker.
 TROI / But your senior officers might have thought you were trying to ingratiate yourself -- I guess they realized you were just young and inexperienced and decided not to hold it against you.
 RIKER / Maybe I am being too hard on Lavelle...
 WORF / (to Geordi) I do not believe he is bluffing.
 GEORDI / I do. (bets) What've you got?
 GEORDI / I can't believe this.
 RIKER / (as he takes in the chips) I'm your worst nightmare...
 RIKER / Come on, Geordi. You're not going to quit just because I'm unbeatable?
 GEORDI / There's something I need to do down in Engineering.
 GEORDI / (to Riker) I'll get you next time.
 RIKER / (smiles) I'll be waiting...
 GEORDI / Good night, everybody.
 GEORDI / Don't get up. I just dropped by to see Taurik.
 GEORDI / I'm headed for Engineering to run those tests on the nacelles. Since you've already put in some work on the technique... I thought you might like to give me a hand.
 GEORDI / Great. Let's go.
 RIKER / Come in.
 BEVERLY / Ben --
 RIKER / You're welcome to give it a try.
 TROI / Pull up a chair.
 WORF / Ensign Sito --
 WORF / (continuing) I also teach an advanced class -- I believe you may be ready to participate.
 WORF / (continuing) Before you can join the group, however, you must pass the... gik'tal.
 WORF / It is a very ancient Klingon ritual. It tests your knowledge of the forms of the mok'bara.
 WORF / No. No practice. That is part of the ritual -- the test must be... unannounced.
 WORF / (continuing) Come.
 WORF / (continuing) Can you see?
 WORF / You did not anticipate.
 WORF / Stop making excuses! Replace the blindfold.
 WORF / Very good, Ensign. You have passed the challenge.
 WORF / It takes courage to say the test is not fair.
 WORF / You... speak Klingon?
 WORF / No... there is not.
 WORF / (continuing) But perhaps the next time you are judged unfairly, you will not have to suffer so many bruises before you protest.
 PICARD / If you're looking for a more lenient commander, I don't think you'll find one.
 PICARD / Please do.
 PICARD / All right, Ensign. I will...
 PICARD / (continuing) It took a lot of courage to come here and face me after what I said to you the other day.
 PICARD / (continuing) You see... I didn't call you in here then to assess your qualifications for the Ops position.
 PICARD / I was harsh with you because I was assessing you for a very important mission. A mission that could involve a situation far more... unnerving than being dressed down by your commanding officer.
 PICARD / Join the senior staff in the Observation Lounge at oh-nine hundred hours. We'll discuss it then.
 PICARD / And Ensign... I do know how you ended up on the Enterprise. I asked for you.
 PICARD / (continuing) I wanted to make sure you got a fair chance to redeem yourself.
 BEVERLY / Yes...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Alyssa, I think you know how much I've come to depend on you. I've recommended your promotion because your performance here has been exemplary.
 BEVERLY / But more than that, I've come to think of you as a friend. Someone I care about...
 BEVERLY / So... I was wondering about you and Andrew Powell...
 BEVERLY / Told me... ?
 BEVERLY / Secret... ?
 BEVERLY / Alyssa -- that's wonderful!
 BEVERLY / I'm so relieved...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I mean -- happy.
 RIKER / Have a seat, Ensign.
 PICARD / This is Joret Dal... he was in the escape pod we retrieved.
 PICARD / (continuing) Joret is a member of the Cardassian military... he is also a Federation operative.
 PICARD / (continuing) He risked his life to come here and give us invaluable information about Cardassia's strategic intentions -- information that could very well enhance the security of Bajor, as well as other planets in this sector. It is imperative that we get him safely back to Cardassian space.
 RIKER / Since his ship was destroyed he's going to have to take one of our shuttlecraft.
 WORF / We have distressed the shuttle so that it appears to have been fired on.
 RIKER / Joret's going to have to try and talk his way past the patrol.
 PICARD / Once the shuttle is safely past the patrol, Joret will put you in an escape pod and send you back across the border.
 RIKER / Since the pod is so small, it shouldn't be detectable.
 PICARD / We'll be waiting here to pick you up.
 PICARD / This is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm not ordering you to take part in it.
 WORF / Be certain you understand the risk you are taking. If you are captured --
 PICARD / Very well, Ensign. Report to Sickbay. (off her reaction) Doctor Crusher will explain.
 PICARD / (continuing) I'd also ask you not to discuss this mission with anyone...
 GEORDI / We're all set...
 WORF / Good luck...
 RIKER / Report.
 DATA / It is possible that at this distance we are simply unable to distinguish the pod from the inorganic matter normally present in space.
 RIKER / Try narrowing the scan field -- see if you can pick up any biosigns.
 RIKER / You're scanning for Bajoran lifesigns, Ensign.
 RIKER / Nothing yet, sir. The pod's thirty-two hours overdue.
 WORF / Sir, I recommend we launch a probe to increase the range of our sensor sweeps.
 RIKER / (quiet) Sending a probe into Cardassian space would be a treaty violation.
 PICARD / Prepare a probe and launch when ready.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WORF / It will be several minutes before we begin to receive the probe's telemetry.
 DATA / (off console) Sir... I am detecting signs of debris two hundred thousand kilometers inside Cardassian space...
 DATA / (continuing, off console) Its mass and composition indicate that it could be the remains of a Federation escape pod...
 PICARD'S (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. We have intercepted a Cardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captor... and was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassian space...
 PICARD / To all personnel with security clearance J-one and higher... this is the Captain. It is my sad duty to inform you --
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / -- that a member of the crew... Ensign Sito Jaxa...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Has been lost in the line of duty...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / She was the finest example of a Starfleet officer... a young woman of remarkable courage... and strength of character.
 PICARD / Her absense will be deeply felt by all who knew her...
 WORF / What?
 WORF / I appreciate what you are trying to do, but it is not... appropriate. You were her friends. I was only her commanding officer...
 TROI (V.O.) / Deanna Troi Personal Log: Stardate 47611.2. I have spent the last three days attending a reunion of my graduating class at the Carvin Institute for Psychological Studies. It was a very... thought-provoking experience.
 The lighting is DIM -- the night shift is on duty. BEVERLY in Command, ENSIGN RAINER at Tactical, other / N.D. Crewmembers at their stations.
 BEVERLY / (to Rainer) Send a message to Commander Data and inform him of our delay.
 TROI ENTERS from the Turbolift. / 
 BEVERLY / Deanna... welcome back.
 TROI / Thank you. I just wanted to report in. I didn't expect to find anyone up except Data.
 BEVERLY / Data's away on assignment. A Federation deep space probe went off course and crashed on Barkon Four. Some of the material in the casing is radioactive, so Data was sent to recover it before it contaminates the biosphere.
 TROI / Isn't Barkon Four inhabited?
 BEVERLY / (nods) There's a pre-industrial society, but the probe crashed over a hundred kilometers from the nearest settlement. Data won't have to make contact with any of the Barkonians.
 BEVERLY / How was the reunion?
 TROI / Fine. It was good to see some old friends... I'd fallen out of touch with most of them. (beat) It was interesting to see the different paths some of their lives have taken...
 TROI / (continuing) Beverly... you don't usually stand a watch on the Bridge even when Data's not here... why this time?
 BEVERLY / I volunteered tonight. I like to get in a little Bridge time now and then... stay on top of operations... tactical procedures... (beat, then smiles) And the truth is... I like it. Not every doctor gets to command a starship... even if it is only the night shift.
 TROI / May I ask you a personal question... what made you decide to become a commander? (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / I mean, you didn't need the rank in order to be Chief Medical Officer... so why put yourself through all the extra work?
 BEVERLY / I don't know... I never gave much thought to my rank for a long time... it seemed pretty trivial compared to being a doctor. (beat) But then, about eight years ago, I began to feel like I wanted to... stretch myself a little.
 BEVERLY / Continue sending him updates on our schedule.
 TROI / Is something wrong?
 BEVERLY / No. I wanted to let Data know that we'll have to delay picking him up for a couple of days. We have orders to rendezvous with the Lexington and take medical supplies to the Taranko Colony.
 TROI / But he's not responding.
 BEVERLY / Geordi said the radiation from the probe would probably interfere with communications... I just thought I'd try anyway. I'm sure he's fine... it's a very routine mission.
 DATA / (electronic) Wayuman... whaaaa... yuuuu... waaaant... what d'yuuuu... what you want... what do you want?
 DATA / (electronic) Runnnn... rung... wrong wrong wrong... what is... (beat, then less electronic) What is wrong with you?
 DATA / My name is Garvin?
 DATA / I do not know my name.
 DATA / You asked... if I knew my name. I do not.
 DATA / Yes. It is becoming... easier.
 DATA / Good-bye.
 DATA / I do not remember being in an accident. (beat) But then, I do not remember very much at all.
 DATA / I walked here... from the mountains.
 DATA / I do have a clear memory of my journey. It began on a steep path in the mountains... near a large waterfall with two jagged promontories.
 DATA / I have no prior memories.
 DATA / No.
 DATA / (understanding) Yes.
 DATA / (reading) "Radioactive."
 DATA / That is what is written on the container.
 DATA / Evidently.
 DATA / I do not know. Perhaps it is my name.
 RIKER is practicing a difficult piece of music on his / trombone, when the door to his quarters OPENS and Troi ENTERS. She quietly moves to a chair so as not to interrupt him. He finishes the piece and then looks over at her expectantly. He plays a couple of notes on the trombone which sort of emulate a "voice" -- the notes and the expression on his face communicate the words "how's that?" She smiles.
 TROI / Is that supposed to be a question?
 TROI / (continuing) Well, if you're asking me if I liked what you were playing, then the answer is yes.
 TROI / (continuing) And I think this is a much better way of communicating for you. It's much less... confusing than when you try to speak normally.
 RIKER / I can always count on the ship's Counselor to boost my self-image.
 TROI / Glad to be of service.
 RIKER / Did you come here for something in particular, or just for some general Riker-bashing?
 TROI / I'd actually like your opinion on something. (beat) I've been thinking about taking the Bridge Officer's test and becoming a full commander.
 RIKER / What brought this up?
 TROI / A lot of things... working on last month's personnel review... talking with Beverly about her experiences... going to my class reunion...
 RIKER / Ah, the class reunion... saw a few old friends who'd taken the test... ?
 TROI / All right, I'll admit that was a catalyst. But I can honestly say it's something I have thought about off and on over the past two years.
 RIKER / Why the past two years?
 TROI / Do you remember when the Enterprise hit that quantum filament... and I was left in command on the Bridge?
 RIKER / (nods) I remember...
 TROI / When it happened, I felt overwhelmed... but when it was over... (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / I realized that a part of me missed it... not the actual disaster, but the experience of being in command. When I was on the Bridge, I felt like I was exploring a new side of myself. I don't want to give up counseling by any means... but I would like to... stretch myself a little.
 RIKER / Deanna, if you want to take the Bridge Officer's test, you have my complete support. But as first officer, I'll be judging your performance. (beat) And I want you to know... I'm a pretty hard judge.
 TROI / I'm a pretty good student.
 RIKER / We'll start tomorrow -- oh eight hundred hours.
 DATA / That is correct.
 DATA / No. However, I cannot have indigestion since I have not eaten.
 DATA / I do not know.
 DATA / Then what do you believe I am?
 DATA / Ice-man?
 DATA / Then I am not ill?
 DATA / Thank you.
 DATA / I am an ice-man.
 DATA / Radioactive.
 DATA / It is acceptable. What is the origin of that name?
 DATA / I do not know.
 DATA / You may be right. But I do not wish to sell all the fragments. They could provide a clue to my identity.
 DATA / (to Skoran) I believe the support structure of the anvil collapsed because some of the wood had rotted.
 DATA / Did I do something wrong, Garvin?
 DATA / You have told me no one from the village has ever been to the Vellorian Mountains. How do you know there are... ferocious creatures there?
 DATA / But no one has actually seen one?
 DATA / In the absence of empirical data on these creatures, how can you support your theory about the nature of my strength?
 DATA / I neither liked nor disliked the food. I simply had no appetite.
 DATA / Where is your mother?
 DATA / Yes. I do.
 GEORDI / We've just lost contact with everything above deck twenty-one... including the Bridge.
 WORF / (off console) There is something wrong with one of the anti-matter containment units. The magnetic field is starting to fluctuate.
 TROI / Switch to auxiliary control.
 WORF / (works) Auxiliary control is not on-line. We are starting to lose containment on anti-matter storage unit three.
 TROI / All right... then switch the EM power inverter to the lateral... no, wait use the neodyne relay.
 GEORDI / (urgent, off console) Commander, the neodyne relay isn't holding. Ten seconds to containment failure.
 TROI / Computer: Emergency procedure. Eject anti-matter storage unit three. Authorization: Troi omega omega three one.
 GEORDI / Commander, the unit's beginning to--
 RIKER'S VOICE / (o.c.) Congratulations. You just destroyed the Enterprise.
 TROI / (sarcastic) Thanks for the encouragement.
 RIKER / Don't feel bad. You passed everything else -- diplomatic law, first contact procedures, Bridge operations... but, the Engineering Qualification is one of the toughest parts of the test.
 TROI / So what did I do wrong?
 RIKER / I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
 TROI / Why not? What kind of test is this?
 RIKER / It's the kind of test you'll have to take again if you want to be a Bridge Officer. And next time, the problem won't be so easy, so you better study up on emergency procedures.
 TROI / How am I supposed to study if you won't tell me what I did wrong?
 RIKER / I don't know. You'll have to figure that out too.
 DATA / I do not believe that is correct.
 DATA / I believe you are reasoning by analogy -- classifying objects and phenomena according to superficial observation rather than by empirical evidence. (beat) For example, wood does not contain fire simply because it is combustible. Nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy. Wood, like any complex organic form, is composed of thousands of different chemical compounds, none of which is fire.
 DATA / Yes. But I do not agree with Talur's assessment. Although I do have... gaps in my memory, I know that fire is not an element.
 DATA / Garvin is correct. You did agree on twenty.
 DATA / (re: microscope) With an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens this instrument will have a higher effective magnification.
 DATA / Garvin, with your permission, I would like to begin my own... investigation regarding the cause of your illness.
 DATA / Gia, I would like you to accompany me to the village. I will need some supplies.
 DATA / I will use these materials to make the laboratory equipment I need to research your father's illness.
 DATA / I do not know. First, I must isolate the cause of the --
 DATA / Am I to understand that Garvin's illness has spread?
 DATA / I think we should leave, Gia.
 DATA / I am studying tissue samples from Garvin and Gia in an attempt to isolate the cause of the illness.
 DATA / Yes. She is also beginning to show signs of the illness.
 DATA / It is a magnifying device based on your hand-held instrument. I have refined the design to increase the magnification level.
 DATA / Of course.
 DATA / Objects appear approximately five hundred times their normal size.
 DATA / As you can see, the cellular damage is quite extensive. However, based on the interstitial transparency and membrane integrity, I do not believe this is an infection or any form of communicable disease.
 DATA / At the moment, I am looking for a common experience or event that Garvin, Skoran, and Gia might have shared that could have a causal relationship to their illness.
 DATA / Yes, but since this illness struck all three of them in a relatively short period of time, it is reasonable to assume that the experience would be recent and unusual.
 DATA / I am aware of that. And I am open to the possibility that I am in some way the causal factor. But since you have had a great deal of contact with me and have shown no sign of the sickness, I tend to discount myself as a likely candidate.
 DATA / I agree.
 DATA / I believe Talur is correct. You should rest. I will attend to your father.
 DATA / Gia. (she turns) When did you begin wearing that pendant?
 DATA / May I see it?
 DATA / This was made from one of the metal fragments I sold to Skoran...
 TROI / (to herself) ... the aft secondary plasma vent has a... triple redundant by-pass... that means the primary access junction would be routed...
 TROI / (without looking up) Come in. (right back into it) ... would be routed through the port transducer matrix...
 TROI / (sarcastic) Here to give me more... encouragement?
 RIKER / No... actually I'm here to tell you that I've decided to cancel the rest of your test.
 TROI / What?
 RIKER / I'm cancelling the test.
 TROI / May I ask why?
 RIKER / You've taken the Engineering Qualification three times now... and you're no closer to passing.
 TROI / Then I'll take it four times or fourteen times or however many times are necessary for me to get it right.
 RIKER / Deanna... this is nothing personal... but not everyone is cut out to be a Bridge Officer. I don't think this is for you.
 TROI / Why? Because I'm not the most technically-minded person on the ship? I may have trouble telling the difference between a plasma conduit and a phase inducer, but there's more to being a bridge officer than just memorizing technical manuals.
 RIKER / That's right, there is. But even if you spend the next month memorizing every technical manual in the computer, I still don't think you'll pass the test.
 TROI / Tell me one thing... is there really a solution? Or is this simply a test of my ability to handle a no-win situation?
 RIKER / There is a solution.
 TROI / Then give me time to find it.
 RIKER / I can't. (beat) As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I can't let anyone serve as a Bridge Officer who isn't qualified. I'm sorry.
 TROI / "My first duty is to the ship... "
 Troi ENTERS. TROI / Computer, load Bridge Officer's Test, program Engineering Qualification Section One.
 TROI / Run program.
 WORF / The control system for the primary containment field is not functioning.
 GEORDI / Something's severed the ODN conduit between here and the antimatter storage deck.
 TROI / (measured) Geordi... could you repair the ODN conduit if you went into that crawlway?
 WORF / (shocked) Sir. That crawlway is in a warp plasma shaft. He would never survive the radiation.
 TROI / I know that. Geordi, could you repair the conduit?
 GEORDI / I... think so.
 TROI / Then do it. (beat) That's an order.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 RIKER'S VOICE / End program.
 RIKER / Something told me you wouldn't let this go. (beat) Congratulations. You passed.
 TROI / (quiet) That's what this was all about, wasn't it? To see if I could order someone to their death.
 RIKER / That's right.
 TROI / I always knew that was part of being in command... I thought I was prepared for it... but when the moment came, I hesitated. It took me four times to realize that was the answer. (beat) Maybe you were right. Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
 RIKER / You did exactly what you needed to do. You tried every alternative... looked at all the options, and in the end you made the hard choice. (beat, then smiles) Come on, let's get out of here... Commander.
 DATA / I have coated this piece of cloth with the liquid which is used in lamps.
 DATA / (continuing) You can see that the cloth becomes luminescent when exposed to an energy source.
 DATA / I believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic pendant and hitting the cloth.
 DATA / It would appear that the container is constructed from a material which can block or absorb the particles coming from the metal.
 DATA / No. It is empirical data. I believe that the fragments were originally placed in this container to protect people from accidental exposure. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / The word "radioactive" may be a warning about the dangerous nature of the metal.
 DATA / I will continue with my experiments. I would like you to gather all the pieces of metal in the village. Put them back in this container.
 DATA / Of course.
 DATA / If you are referring to the illness, you are partially correct, but it is more complex than that. You see, the metal fragments that --
 DATA / I do not know.
 DATA'S VOICE / (o.c.) Gia?
 DATA / I do not know what I am. But I am not like you.
 DATA / No. I am not...
 DATA / I do not wish to scare you.
 DATA / I understand your reaction. I must admit, I do not know what I am.
 DATA / (continuing) But I do not wish to harm you. You or Garvin or anyone else. I only wish to help... to find a cure for the illness. I was getting very close. I need to continue my work, but it will take time. How long will it be until Skoran and the others return?
 DATA / Then I must hurry.
 DATA / Gia... I believe I have found the answer.
 DATA / I believe so.
 DATA / I tested this medicine on skin samples from your father. They showed improvement, so I gave him a spoonful. He is now recovering.
 DATA / A compound I made which will neutralize the particles that are making you ill.
 DATA / (continuing) Swallow this.
 DATA / (continuing) I am sorry that I did not have time to create a more palatable flavor.
 DATA / I must administer this to everyone in the village, but I do not think they will trust me after what happened with Skoran.
 DATA / I am afraid they will not believe you either. (thinks) Gia, is the well in the town square the only source of water for this village?
 DATA / This is very important. Are there any other sources of fresh water near the village?
 DATA / Then I will put the compound into the well water. It will be diluted, but it should still have enough potency to work.
 DATA / I only wish to help you...
 BEVERLY / Excuse me. We're looking for a friend of ours. He may have wandered into your village a few days ago.
 RIKER / You'd remember him... his appearance would have been very... strange. Pale skin, gold eyes...
 BEVERLY / Yes. You know him?
 RIKER / Where is he?
 BEVERLY / (puzzled) I don't understand.
 RIKER / Are you saying... he's dead?
 BEVERLY / The sickness?
 RIKER / What happened to these... pieces of metal?
 RIKER / Data.
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) It's Data all right... he's buried about two meters down. He's been deactivated... I can't tell how bad the damage is.
 RIKER / We can beam him and the probe fragments up to the ship and no one will know.
 Data is lying on the table, still dressed as we saw him in the town square. There is a jagged hole in his uniform with some circuitry hanging out where the metal rod punctured him. Beverly is using a DEVICE on his head and checking the readings on a tricorder. Troi, PICARD and Riker look on. / 
 BEVERLY / Positronic net is on-line... sub-processor relays in place... neuro-electrical systems enabled.
 BEVERLY / Data... are you all right?
 DATA / I do not know. I am... surprised to find myself here. I thought I was on Barkon Four.
 PICARD / What's the last thing you remember?
 DATA / I had located the crashed Federation probe and collected the radioactive fragments. I was attempting to download the sensor logs from the probe's on board computer when there was a... power surge. I believe the surge overloaded my positronic matrix. (beat) After that... I have no memory until this moment.
 DATA / (continuing) But it would appear that I had... an interesting time.
 RIKER / We don't know much about what happened either... except you apparently saved an entire village from radiation poisoning...
 BEVERLY / And you were a very special friend to a little girl.
 TROI / If you'll excuse me, I have the Bridge for this watch.
 DATA / (to Troi) Counselor, have you been promoted during my absence?
 TROI / That's right. (joking) Which means you can call me "sir" from now on.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 TROI and an N.D. TEACHER are supervising an art class. / SEVERAL N.D. STUDENTS, roughly junior high-school age, are making CLAY SCULPTURES. Troi is here as a kind of "guest-lecturer", and DATA is here as well, working on a sculpture of his own.
 TROI / (encouraging) That's very nice.
 TROI / Not at all... birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. But you shouldn't worry about making it look perfect.
 TROI / She's right... it is important for you to be able to give the clay the shape you want it to have. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / But today you're not supposed to concentrate on technique. I'm here to help you focus more on the feelings you want to convey with your sculpture.
 TROI / (continuing) For instance... What do you think about when you see a bird?
 TROI / Fine. Then try to make your sculpture make me think of flying, too.
 TROI / How's it going, Data?
 DATA / I have finished.
 DATA / (continuing) The dimensions are accurate to within one-point-three percent.
 TROI / I'm sure they are... (beat) You obviously have no trouble with realism, Data, but you're here to work on using your imagination. Maybe you should try something a little more... abstract.
 TROI / (continuing) I want you to start a new piece... I'd like you to sculpt... music.
 DATA / (puzzled) Music?
 DATA / Counselor. Music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How can I reproduce a sound with clay?
 TROI / Think of the effects that sounds have on people... the images that music brings to your mind... then give them a form.
 TROI / (continuing, looks at the shape) It's a start.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Data... please report to the Bridge.
 DATA / (taps combadge) Acknowledged. I am on my way.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47615.2. We have encountered a rogue comet in sector one-one-five-six. It is not native to this region of space, and there is no previous record of this object on any Federation charts.
 PICARD, RIKER, and Data are at their stations; N.D. / STARFLEET officers man the other positions. Everyone is studying the Viewscreen.
 DATA / (off console) Based on its present trajectory, the comet appears to have originated in the D'Arsay system.
 RIKER / That's over two sectors from here...
 DATA / That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for eighty-seven million years.
 RIKER / That's a long time alone in the dark.
 PICARD / (to Data) Begin a full sensor analysis, Mister Data. Log the results for the Federation Astrophysical Survey.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / (continuing) The comet's outer shell is composed primarily of gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner core consists of heavier elements--
 PICARD / What was that?
 DATA / (off console) There is distortion within the comet's inner core. I believed we experienced an intense sensor echo.
 RIKER / Can you correct for it?
 DATA / I am attempting to do so now, sir...
 DATA / (continuing) I've compensated for the effect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. (MORE)
 DATA (Cont'd) / We are still picking up some interference, but the distortion is manageable... (beat) At these settings, the scan will be complete in thirty-nine hours.
 BEVERLY / ... Worf said he's going to be teaching us some Mok'bara throwing techniques today.
 TROI / More like falling techniques... the last time we did that I was sore for a week...
 BEVERLY (O.S.) / What's this?
 TROI / I have no idea.
 BEVERLY / Maybe Wil left it here... a little present?
 TROI / It's not quite his style...
 BEVERLY / Then maybe you've got a secret admirer.
 TROI / (smiles) That's an interesting thought...
 BEVERLY / Well, you can figure it out later. We're going to be late.
 GEORDI / We've been getting some pretty strange readings from that comet... now it looks like there's some kind of energy generation coming from the core.
 WORF / Is that unusual?
 GEORDI / The core is normally just a chunk of rock... it should be completely inert.
 RIKER / (shrugs) Maybe we've discovered a new kind of comet...
 RIKER / (continuing) They must be changing the snacks around here.
 GEORDI / I don't recognize it.
 RIKER / (re: snack) Well, whatever you do, don't put it in your mouth.
 RIKER / (continuing) This is terrible.
 WORF / I like it.
 RIKER / Then you can have it.. but it's not what I ordered.
 GEORDI / (lightly) Let's see what they're trying to poison you with...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Wait a minute... this stuff is bio-organic... there are oxygenated cells... serum electrolytes... This looks like some kind of... blood.
 RIKER / You're joking.
 GEORDI / I'm serious.
 RIKER / I'm gonna have a little talk with the bartender.
 GEORDI / It might not be his fault. We should check out the replicator.
 TROI / Nice... Very good... I like that...
 TROI / Data... This is amazing. How did you come up with this?
 DATA / I followed your advice, Counselor. I used my imagination.
 TROI / That's an understatement...
 DATA / For some reason, as I shaped the clay, the image of the mask was exceptionally clear in my mind... the design seemed to flow quite... naturally.
 TROI / (recognizing it) Data, have you been in my quarters?
 DATA / No, Counselor.
 TROI / Somebody left an object in my room... it was some kind of artifact... and it looked similar to this. (beat) You don't know anything about that?
 DATA / I do not.
 DATA / Perhaps we should investigate this matter further.
 RIKER / (to Geordi) These symbols don't match anything in Federation linguistic banks.
 GEORDI / Some kind of alien information has been downloaded into our main computer. I'm not exactly sure how it's working, but it's reconfiguring our systems.
 RIKER / How did it get in?
 GEORDI / I was able to trace its path from the replicators to our sensor array.
 RIKER / The sensors? (thinks) They've been scanning that comet for the last eighteen hours...
 GEORDI / (nods) Those energy readings from the comet's core... the sensor echo... (beat) We still don't know what's inside that thing.
 RIKER / Maybe it's time we found out. (beat) Could we use the phasers to melt away the outer shell of the comet?
 GEORDI / (considers) A dispersed wide-field beam might do the trick... it wouldn't take long to come up with the firing parameters... (to Data) What do you think, Data?
 GEORDI / (continuing) What's the matter?
 DATA / I believe I recognize these symbols.
 RIKER / How?
 DATA / I do not know.
 GEORDI / Do you think your systems may have been affected?
 DATA / It is a possibility. I do not believe my systems are currently impaired, but I will run a full self-diagnostic to make certain.
 RIKER / (beat; re: screen) What do these symbols mean?
 DATA / (continuing, as if reading) "Boundary."
 DATA / (continuing) "Border." "Road." "Companion." "Message." "Messenger."
 DATA / (continuing) "Death."
 WORF / Captain, phasers are set for wide dispersal, ten percent maximum power. The beam will terminate automatically when the comet's core is reached.
 PICARD / (nods) Very well, Mister Worf. Fire...
 WORF / (off console) Phasers have terminated... the outer shell is gone...
 PICARD / Mister Data... What are we looking at? Is it a ship?
 DATA / I do not believe so. The object is nearly solid, composed primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials... It is more than eighty-seven million years old.
 RIKER / That's older than the comet itself. Could someone in the D'Arsay system have built it?
 PICARD / (considers) There are no technologically advanced cultures in that system now... but perhaps there were eighty-seven million years ago.
 RIKER / But why would anyone hide something like that inside a comet?
 PICARD / It's possible the frozen gasses simply accumulated over time as it travelled through space...
 GEORDI / In any case, it's definitely responsible for the system anomalies we've been experiencing. It's been using our sensor beam as a carrier wave to get information into our computers and replicators.
 PICARD / But the question remains: why? What is its purpose?
 DATA / Captain, I believe this object is an informational archive.
 PICARD / What makes you say that?
 DATA / I... do not know, sir. However, I seem to have an intuitive understanding of its function.
 GEORDI / (to Picard) The internal structure of that thing is pretty complex... and it's got a repetitive node configuration which might suggest a database of some kind... but it could be practically anything. (to Data) I don't see how you could know for sure what it is.
 PICARD / Data... do you believe you're in communication with that object?
 DATA / It is a possibility, sir. I recommend that we perform a level one diagnostic of my positronic net immediately to determine if that is the case.
 PICARD / Very well... Mister LaForge, give him a hand.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Do you think it's just trying to make contact with us?
 PICARD / (thoughtful) Perhaps. And if this really is an archive from some ancient civilization, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful... (beat) Mister Worf, keep an eye on the sensors. If the Archive poses any danger to the ship, I want you to sever the connection immediately.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / Captain...
 PICARD / Come in, Number One...
 RIKER / We've confined the system corruption. It's not spreading any further, but we've still got alien symbols floating around inside our computer...
 RIKER / This is quite a collection you've assembled...
 RIKER / (continuing) I've seen these things all over the ship. They all look the same... primitive and non-functional.
 PICARD / (correcting him) Ceremonial... and deceptively primitive. Only an advanced technological culture could have built that object out there. These artifacts must have played a ritualistic role in their society.
 RIKER / Do you think Data's right? Have we stumbled across some kind of alien library?
 PICARD / It's possible... and if so, this could be a find of enormous significance. This "library" seems designed to do far more than simply store information. Who knows how much we could learn from it?
 RIKER / I keep seeing this design...
 PICARD / (nods) It seems to be a symbol of some significance.
 RIKER / What do you think it means?
 PICARD / (offers) The concept of the four cardinal compass directions is common to many different cultures...
 RIKER / The words Data recognized on the computer -- "boundary," "border," "road" -- they were also arranged in that design.
 PICARD / Perhaps everything with the compass design is part of the same theme -- movement. Finding a direction, travelling a path, crossing a boundary--
 RIKER / And "death." One of the symbols was "death."
 PICARD / The ultimate boundary.
 PICARD'S VOICE / I keep seeing this symbol, too.... but it's never prominently displayed...
 PICARD / Always in the background... smaller than the others...
 RIKER / Do you know what it represents?
 PICARD / I have no idea.
 GEORDI / Lower synaptic functions are completely normal... Autonomous systems all check out...
 DATA / I suggest we examine the memory sub-systems next.
 GEORDI / All right...
 GEORDI / (noticing) Data... what's the matter?
 DATA / I am... not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation...
 GEORDI / What is it?
 DATA / An... impulse.
 GEORDI / Impulse? What kind of impulse?
 DATA / I do not know.
 GEORDI / I'm checking your higher functions.
 DATA / Geordi... What does it feel like when a person... loses his mind?
 GEORDI / Data, you're scaring me. What's the matter?
 DATA / I... do not... know...
 GEORDI / You're gonna be all right. You're with me, okay?
 DATA / Okay.
 GEORDI / What's going on... ?
 GEORDI / (stunned) Data...
 DATA_IHAT / Masaka is waking.
 GEORDI / Captain, he just--
 DATA_IHAT / (interrupting) I waited for you, Captain. You should feel honored... I don't usually wait for anybody.
 PICARD / (cautiously) What is it you want?
 DATA_IHAT / Masaka is waking.
 PICARD / Are you Masaka?
 DATA_IHAT / What were my exact words?
 GEORDI / You said, "Masaka is waking."
 DATA_IHAT / And isn't that what I've been saying since we first met?
 DATA_IHAT / I'm not "Masaka", Captain... (proudly) I am Ihat.
 PICARD / What have you done to Commander Data?
 DATA_IHAT / Commander Data... ?
 DATA_IHAT / (continuing) You mean the one who was here?
 PICARD / Yes.
 DATA_IHAT / He's gone. And who can say where?
 PICARD / (to com) Counselor Troi, report to Engineering immediately.
 PICARD / (continuing) Ihat. The place you came from... Is it a cultural archive of your species?
 DATA_IHAT / (simply) I come from Masaka's city.
 PICARD / Are there others like you there?
 DATA_IHAT / (laughs) There are no others like me.
 PICARD / Who is Masaka?
 DATA_IHAT / You will find out...
 DATA_IHAT / (continuing) I don't think Masaka will like this place... at least not the way it is now...
 PICARD / (pressing) I would like to know more about this Masaka... perhaps we can speak --
 DATA_IHAT / Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you need to know about Masaka... that is what she is.
 DATA_IHAT / You must go... leave this place before she finds you. It can be done... I did it...
 TROI / What's going on, sir?
 DATA_IHAT / Masaka... ?
 GEORDI / Data!
 DATA_VICTIM / Masaka! I am yours! Every part of me is yours!
 PICARD / (gravely, to N.D. Security) Get him to Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / Every time he saw Deanna, he'd fall to his knees screaming "Take me, Masaka -- take me."
 TROI / Data was acting as if he were a sacrificial victim of some kind...
 PICARD / And apparently one all too willing to go to his death.
 BEVERLY / I put him in isolation in his quarters. He's under guard... he seems to have calmed down a little.
 RIKER / Couldn't we just shut him down and purge his memory systems?
 GEORDI / I don't think it's going to be that simple...
 GEORDI / This is a micrograph of what's happened to Data's positronic net. As near as I can tell, these are behavioral nodes... I've found fourteen of them so far. (beat) I think the Archive is using Data to create different "people" from its culture... in the same way it used our replicators to create artifacts.
 TROI / As a result, his real personality has been completely buried. In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities.
 GEORDI / And the Archive hasn't stopped yet... Data's positronic net is still being transformed. There's no way to tell how many more personalities might emerge...
 RIKER / Our sensors are still in contact with the Archive. Would there be a risk to Data if we severed that connection?
 GEORDI / I don't know... but I wouldn't want to take the chance. Right now, our only link to the Archive is that sensor beam. If there's a way to reverse what's happened to Data, I think we're going to need that link to do it.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, continue to scan the Archive. Try to find some way to access it. In the meantime, I'll see what I can learn from these "people" inside Data.
 PICARD / (gently) It's all right... I'm not going to hurt you...
 DATA_VICTIM / Only Masaka can hurt me... I am for her alone...
 PICARD / (continuing) I need to speak to Ihat. Do you understand me? Ihat...
 DATA_IHAT / Captain...
 DATA_IHAT / (continuing) That was a cruel joke to play on me. For a moment -- a brief moment -- I actually thought that woman was Masaka.
 PICARD / Whoever took your place wasn't afraid of Masaka -- he almost seemed eager for his fate.
 DATA_IHAT / Pitiful, isn't it? (mock Victim voice) "Take me! Take me!" Ha. You wouldn't catch me humiliating myself for a woman -- even if she were a queen.
 PICARD / Then Masaka is your queen... ?
 DATA_IHAT / She's a lazy creature... she spends most of her time sleeping... (beat) The problem is what she does when she's awake.
 PICARD / Then should we try to keep her asleep?
 DATA_IHAT / (laughs) Try to keep the sun from climbing the sky? Only Korgano can do that. And he's not here.
 PICARD / Where is he?
 DATA_BOY / Help me... please...
 PICARD / What's wrong?
 DATA_BOY / I'm afraid.
 PICARD / Of what?
 DATA_BOY / Of her.
 PICARD / Masaka?
 DATA_BOY / Her.
 PICARD / (taps combadge) Picard to Bridge! Report!
 RIKER / (to com) The Archive just activated some kind of tractor beam, sir. We can't disengage it.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Has there been any damage to the ship?
 RIKER / (to com) Nothing major, sir, but Ten Forward reported an emergency. Worf's on his way.
 GEORDI / (to com) Captain, there's some kind of energy pulse coming through the tractor beam...
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / It's overriding our control systems...
 PICARD / (to com) I'll be right there...
 DATA_BOY / Don't leave me.
 PICARD / I... I... won't... leave you... (beat) Please... let go...
 DATA_BOY / Does it hurt?
 PICARD / (barely) Yes...
 DATA_BOY / She's going to hurt us all...
 DATA_IHAT / Now you've done it. Masaka is awake.
 TROI / (re: sun image) Who is this?
 PICARD / I'd say it's Masaka. Ihat referred to her as a queen... it's not unusual in ceremonial cultures for royalty to be symbolized by a sun.
 TROI / You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her... even terrified.
 PICARD / (nods) According to Data, the sun image is also the symbol for death.
 PICARD / There it is again... this U-shaped symbol... small and insignificant... almost like an afterthought...
 GEORDI / Captain, this is incredible... These artifacts weren't beamed over here from the archive... the matter in Ten Forward was transformed.
 PICARD / Into living plants? How is that possible?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure. But bit by bit, the ship's being transformed.
 WORF / We have received reports from the rest of the ship. Part of deck twelve is now an aqueduct.
 TROI / What are we being transformed into?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure I want to find out.
 PICARD / I don't think we have a choice... we'll have to destroy the Archive. Mister Worf?
 WORF / Sir, our weapon control systems are inoperative. However, we could configure a photon torpedo for manual launch...
 PICARD / Make it so.
 PICARD / There's so much here we could have learned... I regret losing that opportunity.
 GEORDI / Okay... I've locked in the targeting parameters... what's the phase alignment now?
 WORF / Less than point seven percent.
 GEORDI / That'll do it. I'm setting the yield at maximum...
 WORF / (puzzled) Sir... the onboard power systems are not functioning...
 GEORDI / What's going on here... ?
 GEORDI / Something tells me we'd better get out of here...
 WORF / (taps combadge) Engineering to Bridge -- emergency transport! Two to beam out...
 RIKER / Maybe we'd better talk in here. The Observation Lounge seems to have become a swamp.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) What's our status?
 GEORDI / So far the Archive's transformed over twenty percent of the ship... and we've lost main propulsion and weapons systems in the process.
 RIKER / What about communications? Sensors? Life support?
 GEORDI / We have communications, and limited sensor control. Life support seems unaffected.
 BEVERLY / I've been analyzing samples of these alien plant forms. They've been formed from biological matter we have on the ship...
 GEORDI / The stone, the artifacts... they're made the same way -- extrapolated from the ship's own alloys.
 BEVERLY / Apparently the Archive can reorder and transform molecular structures -- including DNA -- to make whatever it wants.
 PICARD / So it's using our ship -- our alloys, our DNA, -- to create elements of its own culture...
 TROI / But why is all this happening? What is the Archive trying to accomplish?
 WORF / It could be a weapon.
 WORF / It is powerful and insidious. It has completely disarmed us.
 RIKER / Maybe it's more benign than that. If a civilization were dying... they might have created this technology to preserve their culture, and re-create it at some later point...
 PICARD / It could even be a sophisticated terraforming device.
 PICARD / The Archive creates an environment... all the elements which enable a culture to exist...
 PICARD / But whatever the intent behind the process, I don't want this ship transformed into an alien city. Mister La Forge, do you have any ideas?
 GEORDI / We still haven't been able to cut off that beam... but I've managed to access the Archive by sending an energy pulse back along their signal path. If I can locate the transformation program, I might be able to get control of it.
 PICARD / Good, keep at it...
 PICARD'S VOICE / But somehow... I believe the answer lies there...
 PICARD / ... with Masaka. We need to find her... access her... talk to her.
 PICARD / (cautious) Hello...
 DATA_ELDER / It's difficult... to stay warm...
 PICARD / The fire feels good...
 DATA_ELDER / But it's not warm enough. Not for an old man.
 PICARD / Tell me... about Masaka.
 DATA_ELDER / My daughter?
 PICARD / Yes... how can I talk to her?
 DATA_ELDER / Talk -- to Masaka?
 PICARD / Yes. It's important. Can you tell her I must speak with her?
 DATA_ELDER / Children grow... forget their parents... no, only Korgano can talk to Masaka.
 PICARD / Korgano... who is that?
 DATA_ELDER / So cold... can't stay warm...
 DATA_IHAT / Well, you're a persistent one, aren't you?
 PICARD / Ihat?
 DATA_IHAT / Is anyone else so charming?
 PICARD / Masaka is taking over my ship.
 DATA_IHAT / I told you she would.
 PICARD / I want to talk with her... but I'm told only Korgano can do that.
 DATA_IHAT / Who told you that?
 PICARD / An old man... Masaka's father...
 DATA_IHAT / Ah, yes... legends say she chopped him up and used his bones to make the world. (beat) Any wonder he doesn't like to talk about her?
 PICARD / How can I find Korgano?
 DATA_IHAT / I don't know. He's not chasing her anymore.
 PICARD / Where has he gone?
 DATA_IHAT / Stop asking these questions. I was fast enough to avoid her once... I don't want her to find me again. I'll end up on her sacrificial slab.
 PICARD / If Masaka is looking for a sacrifice... she can take me instead. (beat) Perhaps then she'd stop looking for you.
 DATA_IHAT / (a chuckle) Well, there's an idea. Better you than me.
 PICARD / All right. Tell me what to do...
 DATA_IHAT / You must build Masaka's temple... the Queen's temple. That will get her attention.
 PICARD / Very well. How do I do that?
 DATA_IHAT / You need the sign. (beat, coy) I could give it to you... so could the Old Man. But just try getting it out of him.
 PICARD / Give me the sign.
 DATA_IHAT / If she finds out... (beat) You can't imagine her rage... she lets people die of thirst... a terrible death. Sometimes she burns them alive... (beat, in awe) She is glorious.
 PICARD / Ihat... the sign. What is it?
 DATA_IHAT / If she comes... you'll take my place?
 PICARD / Yes.
 DATA_IHAT / All right. Quickly. Give me your hand.
 DATA_IHAT / (continuing) A line, as the unending horizon... (beat) A curve as --
 DATA_IHAT / (continuing) She has found me.
 PICARD / Masaka, show yourself. I'll go with you...
 DATA_IHAT / (continuing) It seems... I was not fast enough...
 DATA_ELDER / So hard to stay warm...
 PICARD / Let me help you...
 DATA_ELDER / Are you one of my children? (turns to fire) I don't remember anymore.
 PICARD / I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. (beat) Masaka's temple.
 DATA_ELDER / It won't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. No one else can stop her.
 PICARD / A line... as the unending horizon... (beat) A curve...
 PICARD / (continuing) A line... as the unending horizon.
 DATA_ELDER / ... as a rolling hillside.
 DATA_ELDER / (continuing) A point... as a distant bird.
 DATA_ELDER / (continuing) A ray... as the rising sun.
 PICARD / Thank you.
 DATA_ELDER / Now sit with me... tend the fire...
 DATA_BOY / I'm alone... there's no one left to help me... she's coming.
 PICARD / Are the others dead? Did Masaka kill them?
 DATA_BOY / No. She sent them away. It will take them days to die.
 GEORDI / I think I've found the Archive's transformation program.
 PICARD / Will it accept the symbol for Masaka's temple?
 GEORDI / I think so. I've isolated the program's input pathways. They're keyed to accept symbols...
 GEORDI / (continuing) If I input this one, it should initiate the transformation process...
 RIKER / And create the temple?
 GEORDI / I hope so... if this is the wrong symbol, it might turn the Enterprise into a big chunk of rock. There's no way to be sure.
 TROI / The question is... can we trust a personality from an alien Archive that seems bent on taking us over?
 PICARD / (considers) Ihat risked his life to show me that symbol... and Masaka killed him for doing it. (beat) I think we have to risk it.
 WORF / Captain. The entire deck has been cleared of personnel. We can proceed.
 PICARD / (to com) Commander Riker, we're ready...
 RIKER / Understood. (to Geordi) Initiate the transformation.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir. I'm inputting the symbol...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Now...
 PICARD / (re: throne) This would seem to be Masaka's temple...
 WORF / There's no one else here.
 PICARD / Ihat said creating the temple would get her attention... it may take time before she shows herself.
 WORF / And how will she do that?
 PICARD / I don't know.
 TROI / Captain... look at this.
 PICARD / This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired... That could be significant...
 PICARD / (continuing) There it is again... and again. Clearly this is an important pairing...
 PICARD / (continuing) "He's not chasing her anymore... "
 TROI / Sir?
 PICARD / Ihat said that someone named Korgano was not chasing Masaka anymore. And the old man said, "he pursues her no longer... "
 PICARD / (continuing) In a sense, this smaller symbol is chasing Masaka. Perhaps it represents Korgano.
 WORF / The symbol suggests antlers of some kind... horns. Maybe it's meant to represent an animal...
 TROI / Animal gods are worshipped in many cultures...
 PICARD / Both Ihat and the old man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka... (beat, thinking) Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of "balance" into their belief systems. Masaka is a queen, a powerful, god-like figure... it's not unreasonable to assume that she might have a counterpart... or a consort...
 PICARD / (continuing) Spread out... see if you can find that horn-like symbol anywhere else.
 TROI / This is the most prominent instance of the horn symbol we've seen yet...
 WORF / But now it appears as though Masaka's sun is chasing it.
 TROI / An animal chasing the sun... ?
 PICARD / Maybe it's simpler than that. (beat) Maybe the relationship between them is more like the sun and the moon.
 WORF / I see... Masaka and Korgano changing positions... the sun setting and the moon rising.
 PICARD / Exactly. Two powerful rulers, changing places in a continuous cycle...
 TROI / And like the sun and the moon, only one of them can be in ascendance at any given time...
 PICARD / If we could find Korgano within the Archive and bring him out... perhaps he could force Masaka to leave.
 WORF / But would we be any better off with him?
 PICARD / (considers) Ihat and the others didn't seem to be afraid of Korgano...
 PICARD / (continuing) Masaka...
 PICARD / (continuing) Masaka, I am Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation--
 DATA_MASAKA / (cutting him off) Go away.
 PICARD / (presses on) Please listen to us. Your Archive is destroying our ship--
 DATA_MASAKA / I do not hear you.
 WORF / She won't even listen to us.
 PICARD / Then we'll have to find someone she will listen to.
 GEORDI / I've found it, sir...
 GEORDI / (continuing) This is the only place in the Archive where Korgano's moon symbol is by itself and not paired with Masaka's.
 PICARD / Mister La Forge, access the transformation program.
 PICARD / (continuing) When you're ready, input the symbol.
 RIKER / Isn't that a little risky?
 TROI / We have no way of knowing what the result would be. The symbol might generate anything from Korgano's temple... to Korgano himself.
 PICARD / In some sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbol represents -- it might give us a way to control her. (beat) If you have a better idea, I'd be glad to entertain it.
 GEORDI / I've accessed the program, sir.
 PICARD / Initiate the transformation.
 RIKER / Another mask...
 PICARD / Perhaps we've been approaching this incorrectly. We're dealing with a highly ritualistic culture... a society based on symbol and myth. Maybe we need to confront them on those terms instead... (beat) If I can incorporate myself into their rituals, perhaps Masaka will listen to me.
 RIKER / (catching on) You're going to pose as Korgano.
 TROI / Captain, we know so little about this culture... and even less about Korgano himself. How will you convince Masaka that you're him?
 PICARD / I'm not entirely sure. But there are similarities between this culture and others I've studied. (beat) I suppose I'll just have to improvise.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, what's our status?
 WORF / (off console) I estimate we have less than two hours before there's nothing left of the ship... at least nothing that we recognize.
 PICARD (O.S.) / Masaka!
 DATA_MASAKA / Korgano... ?
 PICARD / Are you surprised to see me?
 DATA_MASAKA / I thought I had escaped you.
 PICARD / You should know that's impossible.
 DATA_MASAKA / You are a fine hunter... but I am a powerful prey. You will never catch me.
 PICARD / Do you really want to be the prey... forever?
 DATA_MASAKA / I thought I was alone here. I thought I wouldn't have to share the sky with you...
 PICARD / But without me... you aren't complete. I know you, Masaka... you live for the chase just as much as I do. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) Won't you miss being the hunter... pursuing me... forcing me from the sky so that you can rise again?
 DATA_MASAKA / You know me well, Korgano...
 PICARD / I think you may be getting tired... it's difficult to brighten the sky forever...
 DATA_MASAKA / I am getting sleepy... you always do that to me...
 PICARD / Only so you can wake at dawn... and begin the hunt again...
 DATA_MASAKA / Begin the hunt again... (beat) I am eager for that.
 PICARD / As am I.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Picard... I don't know what you did, sir... but it looks like everything's back to normal.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (to Data) Mister Data -- are you all right?
 DATA / I believe so, sir. But I am not entirely certain what has happened. Have I been dreaming again?
 PICARD / I'm afraid it will take some time to explain.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47612.4. Commander La Forge has managed to disable the alien transformation program. Starfleet will send an archaeological team to study the Archive further.
 PICARD / I don't understand... I thought all the alien artifacts had disappeared from the Enterprise.
 DATA / This was not created by the Archive... this is the clay mask I originally made. I have since glazed it.
 DATA / Yes. Although I am relieved to be rid of those alien personalities... there is a sense in which I am now... empty.
 PICARD / I can imagine. Doctor Crusher said there might have been dozens of personalities inside you.
 DATA / I suspect the number was much greater.
 DATA / My impression is that there were thousands... of all ages and walks of life. (beat) It was a remarkable experience.
 PICARD / Well, Data, you may never become fully human... but you've had an experience that transcends the human condition. (beat) You have been an entire civilization.
 PICARD / (wry) Nonetheless... it's time to stand watch on the night shift.
 DATA / Yes, sir. Good night.
 DATA / (off console) We are losing containment in the starboard nacelle tube --
 PICARD / Try to get more power to the field coils.
 DATA / (works) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Geordi, report.
 GEORDI / I can't shut down the plasma injectors -- someone's locked out the controls.
 DATA / (off console) The plasma venting system has engaged.
 WORF / Two more decks --
 RIKER / (hits combadge) Riker to Bridge -- we've almost reached the nacelle tube.
 PICARD / Acknowledged. (to Data) Release the exterior hull plate. We may have to jettison the core.
 RIKER / (quiet) What happened?
 RIKER / See if you can shut down the plasma flow.
 RIKER / Dan...
 RIKER / It's me... Wil Riker.
 RIKER / (continuing) I was here yesterday, remember?
 RIKER / Whatever happened, we can talk about it. I want to help.
 RIKER / I want you to be able to see me, that's all... so we can talk.
 RIKER / Dan, wait --
 WORF / I have unlocked the controls --
 RIKER / Tell me what happened. Maybe I can help.
 RIKER / A few more seconds and we could've saved his life...
 WORF / Commander... you did everything you could. It was not your fault.
 RIKER / I had the strangest feeling that... he didn't even recognize me -- and I was with him just the other day when I supervised the tube refit.
 PICARD / How did he seem then?
 RIKER / Fine. In fact I complimented him for getting the refit done faster than expected. He was pleased that I noticed.
 TROI / I met with him during crew evaluations about six weeks ago. He was very positive; he was looking forward to being posted to the nacelle tube.
 RIKER / He was a fine officer, with a good career ahead of him. I just don't understand why he would want to...
 PICARD / In my years as a Starship Captain, I've had to notify many families that they'd lost a loved one. But never to suicide. I'd like to be able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's family some explanation for what happened -- to help them make sense of it.
 WORF / He may have left a message of some kind, explaining why he did it.
 PICARD / (to Troi and Worf) I want the two of you to try and piece together a picture of his last few days.
 TROI / If he made any personal logs, it might be helpful to go through them.
 PICARD / You're authorized to do so.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Captain.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / I've completed a damage assessment. We should be able to get underway within the hour.
 PICARD / Geordi, the medical situation on Barson Two has worsened -- Starfleet has given us permission to exceed warp speed limitations so we can get back on schedule.
 GEORDI / We'll be able to give you warp eight if you need it.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Acknowledged.
 DATA / Geordi, would you agree that the instinct for self-preservation is shared by most life forms?
 GEORDI / I'd say it's probably the most basic instinct.
 DATA / That being the case, I am having difficulty understanding why someone would deliberately terminate their own existence.
 GEORDI / I don't know, Data. All I can think is that maybe Lieutenant Kwan felt like there was something... wrong in his life, something he felt powerless to fix.
 DATA / I believe I understand. I have been in a similar situation.
 GEORDI / Really?
 DATA / The first months following my activation were a difficult period for me... there were many problems associated with my becoming sentient.
 GEORDI / Because your neural net was still forming.
 DATA / As I acquired new skills, neural pathways would form and take the place of other, less complex pathways. It was very... disorienting.
 GEORDI / Sure sounds like it.
 DATA / As my systems grew in complexity, it became increasingly difficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net. The probability of cascade failure grew with each added pathway. I came to the conclusion that it would be easier and safer to shut myself down and start again.
 GEORDI / But if you did that, you wouldn't have remembered any of the things that had happened to you.
 DATA / In a way, it would have been like... committing suicide.
 GEORDI / So what did you do?
 DATA / I decided against the procedure. I chose instead to treat the problems I was having with my systems as... challenges to be overcome, instead of obstacles to be avoided.
 GEORDI / That's a great way of looking at it. It's too bad Lieutenant Kwan wasn't able to look at his problems the same way.
 TROI / I've gone over Kwan's personnel records -- he had an exceptionally stable psychological profile.
 WORF / When we were in the control room, it seemed as if he were trying to... explain something he'd done... something terrible.
 TROI / He'd been on the Enterprise over two years. No one has ever reported an altercation with him.
 WORF / (continuing) These were his quarters.
 WORF / This is a Napean design...
 TROI / His mother is Napean; his father's human.
 TROI / (continuing) Everything looks so... normal. For some reason I was half expecting to find the place a mess.
 WORF / Yes... it is strange to think that someone could be considering ending his life and yet not give any outward sign of it.
 WORF / (continuing) Right before he jumped, he seemed almost... calm.
 TROI / He must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did. It could be that the prospect of ending that pain felt like a great relief.
 TROI / This is Ensign... Calloway, isn't it?
 WORF / She is a medical technician in Sickbay.
 TROI / It's always hard to lose someone you care about... but to lose them like this...
 WORF / We should start going over his logs...
 TROI / This is his last entry; he made it before going on duty this morning.
 TROI / Ensign Calloway...
 TROI / (continuing) That doesn't sound like a man planning on ending his life.
 WORF / No... it does not...
 TROI / I thought you might like to know that in his personal logs, Dan talked about you a great deal. He loved you very much.
 TROI / That's what I'm trying to find out. I know it's hard to talk about right now... but it would be very helpful if you could tell me a few things about him.
 TROI / (continuing) When was the last time you saw him?
 TROI / Did he mention anything that happened recently... anything that might have upset him?
 TROI / Nara... she's his superior officer in the nacelle tube.
 TROI / Was he prone to mood swings, or depression?
 TROI / What do you mean?
 TROI / Napeans are partially empathic -- he may have inherited some of his mother's abilities.
 TROI / I didn't see you there...
 TROI / (continuing) You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't you?
 TROI / I'm investigating Lieutenant Kwan's death. I just wanted to take a look around.
 TROI / Did you notice any change in his behavior recently?
 TROI / How was his job performance?
 TROI / Did he get along with his coworkers?
 TROI / But not all?
 TROI / Where was Lieutenant Kwan's station?
 TROI / (shaken) I... don't know...
 Troi is sitting on the center bio-bed, still shaken. BEVERLY is doing a TRICORDER scan. Riker and Worf / stand nearby.
 TROI / I don't know how to describe it... I was suddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions -- fear, rage, panic.
 RIKER / Whose emotions? I thought you said you were alone.
 TROI / I was. The sensations didn't seem to be coming from any one person -- they were just there, in the room.
 WORF / I scanned the area -- I picked up no anomalous readings.
 RIKER / (to Troi) How could you be getting an empathic impression from an empty room?
 TROI / I don't know...
 BEVERLY / Could the fact that Kwan was partially empathic have something to do with it?
 RIKER / What do you mean?
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure... but the feelings Troi described certainly seem consistent with suicide.
 RIKER / (to Troi) Could his death have left some sort of... empathic echo?
 TROI / I suppose it's a possibility... but I don't see how.
 TROI / (continued) If I went back to the nacelle tube, I might be able to get a better sense of what I experienced.
 BEVERLY / I'm not sure that's a good idea -- you're showing elevated levels of psilosynine.
 WORF / Psilosynine?
 BEVERLY / A neuro-transmitter involved in telepathy. (to Troi) The experience overwhelmed you the first time. I don't think you should go back until the levels return to normal.
 RIKER / How long?
 BEVERLY / Three, maybe four hours.
 RIKER / Next time I want someone with you.
 WORF / I will accompany you, Counselor.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47623.2. We've arrived at Starbase Three-twenty-eight on schedule. After taking aboard medical supplies, we will depart for Barson Two.
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / (continued) Hello, Worf.
 WORF / Counselor...
 WORF / Have you found anything in Lieutenant Kwan's logs?
 TROI / Everything I've seen indicates he was well-adjusted and optimistic. (beat) Were you able to talk with Ensign Trake?
 WORF / Yes... I interviewed all of Kwan's co-workers.
 TROI / From what I've read, Trake was his best friend.
 WORF / He observed nothing that indicated Kwan was contemplating ending his life. Nor did any of the others.
 TROI / It just doesn't make any sense...
 TROI / Can I get you anything?
 WORF / No, thank you.
 TROI / Yridian tea...
 TROI / (continued) I've been thinking about what happened to me in the nacelle tube... whether it was an empathic echo left by Kwan's death...
 WORF / In the past, have your empathic experiences always involved the physical presence of another person?
 TROI / All the ones I'm sure of, yes.
 WORF / What do you mean, sure of?
 TROI / Well... when I was a young girl, my Grandfather used to tell me stories by the fire... I would close my eyes and listen to his mind for hours on end...
 WORF / He told you these stories telepathically... ?
 TROI / My grandfather rarely spoke out loud... He said that was for off-worlders who didn't know any better.
 TROI / The only time I can remember his stories is when I go home... and sit by the fireplace. Sometimes when I'm there, alone... it's almost as if I can hear his voice in my head.
 WORF / Yes... I have sought visions in fire.
 TROI / I can't explain it, but it felt very real to me. Just like what happened in the nacelle tube.
 WORF / There are things we do not understand, yet they exist nonetheless.
 TROI / I keep thinking about Ensign Calloway... she needs to know what happened to Kwan -- it's the only way she'll ever be able to put his death behind her.
 WORF / This must be a very difficult time for her.
 TROI / Do you know what she regrets most? That she and Kwan didn't take full advantage of the time they had together... they knew each other for a long time, but they didn't get together until recently.
 WORF / She wishes they had acted on their feelings sooner... ?
 WORF / (continued) Perhaps I should let you rest.
 TROI / It's all right --
 WORF / If you will excuse me, Counselor.
 RIKER / (a greeting) Worf...
 WORF / Commander...
 RIKER / Two Til'amin froths, please.
 WORF / Lieutenant Corell seems to be enjoying your company.
 RIKER / (smiles) I'd like to think so.
 WORF / Are you... involved with her?
 RIKER / I'm not sure yet.
 RIKER / (continuing) Why do you ask? Are you interested in her?
 WORF / No...
 WORF / (continuing) But if I were, I would of course discuss the situation with you before proceeding further.
 RIKER / I appreciate the thought, but you really wouldn't have to do that.
 WORF / I would never want to come between you and anyone you were involved with... or had ever been involved with.
 RIKER / Is there... someone in particular you're talking about?
 WORF / No. Is there... someone in particular you would prefer I not become involved with?
 RIKER / Worf... you sound like a man asking a friend if he can start dating his sister.
 WORF / No, I am merely... never mind. Excuse me, sir.
 TROI / Could you open this door for me?
 WORF / Yes, but only for a short time. After ninety seconds the plasma venting system will engage to prevent degradation of the forcefield.
 TROI / I just want to take a quick look...
 WORF / May I ask what you are looking for?
 TROI / I'm... not sure...
 WOMAN / No... please... don't...
 TROI / Worf... ?
 TROI / Worf, where are you?
 WORF / Counselor... are you all right --
 TROI / Get me out of here...
 PICARD / Do you remember anything else?
 TROI / I saw a tool crate on the floor... it was labeled Utopia Planitia.
 DATA / The shipyard where the Enterprise was built.
 PICARD / Clearly this was much more than an empathic echo. It seems that you were actually seeing something that happened in the control room eight years ago.
 TROI / Everyone was looking directly at me. It's almost as if... I were seeing through someone else's eyes.
 DATA / Lieutenant Kwan was partially empathic...
 BEVERLY / Maybe you were seeing through his eyes?
 TROI / It's a possibility... but I don't understand how it could have happened.
 PICARD / Let's put that question aside for a moment and assume that by some unexplained phenomenon, you witnessed an event that may have involved Lieutenant Kwan. (to Troi) The faces you saw -- did you recognize them?
 TROI / I don't think I've ever seen the woman before, or the man who was with her. But there was someone else there. A man... he was staring at me in the most peculiar way. I think he had... reddish hair. He seemed familiar to me... but it's all so hazy, like trying to remember a dream.
 PICARD / The woman seemed terrified of something... then you saw her again, laughing -- presumably at Lieutenant Kwan.
 BEVERLY / What could it all mean?
 TROI / I don't know. But something terrible happened in that room. I felt it.
 PICARD / Counselor... I want you to look over the personnel files from Utopia Planitia and see if you can identify the faces you saw.
 TROI / If only there were some way I could go back to the control room and not be overwhelmed by the experience -- it might help me remember some detail that could be relevant.
 BEVERLY / I could give you an inhibitor that would slow your brain's production of psilosynine. That would probably suppress your empathic abilities enough to make the experience manageable.
 TROI / I'd like to try.
 PICARD / Very well, Counselor.
 BEVERLY / It'll take about sixteen hours to synthesize the inhibitor.
 WORF / I apologize for being late. The viral medicines we are transporting to Barson Two require special security measures to insure they are properly contained.
 WORF / (continuing) Have you found anything?
 TROI / No... there were literally thousands of people involved in building the Enterprise.
 WORF / Perhaps if you found a way to narrow the search parameters.
 TROI / I think I have. The man who seemed familiar to me may have been on board the Enterprise during the last seven years. I've asked the computer to limit its search to personnel who've served at Utopia Planitia and on the ship.
 TROI / Ensign Salvatore... he transferred off the Enterprise last year.
 TROI / (continuing) Lieutenant Ziff... she's in quantum mechanics.
 TROI / That's him.
 WORF / (off monitor) Lieutenant Walter Pierce...
 TROI / I remember now... he came aboard about six months ago. I think he's in Engineering.
 WORF / You were Lieutenant Kwan's supervisor at Utopia Planitia.
 TROI / Did you spend time in the nacelle control room while it was under construction?
 TROI / Were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as Lieutenant Kwan?
 WORF / So you do not remember?
 TROI / Do you recall if anything... unusual happened there?
 TROI / An altercation, perhaps. Possibly involving Lieutenant Kwan.
 TROI / Not at all. You see, when I went into the nacelle room, I had an... empathic experience.
 WORF / We believe she may have been seeing some event that occurred there eight years ago.
 TROI / And -- I saw you there.
 TROI / (continuing) Do you have any idea why that might be?
 TROI / Lieutenant... you're probably aware that I can sense whether someone's telling the truth.
 TROI / I'm sure, then, that if you were to... remember anything that might be relevant to our investigation, you'd contact me.
 TROI / Thank you, Lieutenant.
 TROI / The strange thing is I couldn't read him at all.
 WORF / But you implied that you could...
 WORF / We have played poker together many times. I have never known you to bluff.
 TROI / Well... it wouldn't be much of a bluff if you knew, would it?
 TROI / (continuing) The fact that I couldn't read him suggests that he has at least some telepathic ability...
 WORF / But Pierce is human.
 TROI / That's what I don't understand...
 TROI / (continuing) Even though I couldn't read his emotions, it did seem to me that he was... holding something back.
 WORF / Yes. I thought so as well.
 TROI / Maybe we should try to access the Engineering Logs from Utopia Planitia. We might find out more about him.
 WORF / There might be something in them about Lieutenant Kwan, as well.
 TROI / It looks like it'll take about half an hour for the transmission to be completed.
 WORF / Perhaps we should continue in the morning... ?
 TROI / It is late.
 WORF / Yes, you must be tired.
 TROI / A little...
 WORF / Well. I will say good night.
 TROI / Good night.
 WORF / We should get an early start tomorrow.
 TROI / Yes. We should.
 TROI / See you in the morning...
 WORF / Yes...
 WORF / Deanna...
 TROI / Hello...
 WORF / Breakfast is ready...
 TROI / Mmm... that sounds good...
 TROI / (continuing) But it can wait...
 TROI / (continuing) Why didn't we do this a long time ago... ?
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / Crusher to Counselor Troi.
 TROI / Yes, Doctor.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / I've synthesized the inhibitor; you can come to Sickbay whenever you're ready.
 TROI / Acknowledged.
 BEVERLY / Crusher to Lieutenant Worf.
 WORF / Worf, here.
 BEVERLY'S COM VOICE / The medical supplies are ready to be taken to the cargo bay for transport.
 WORF / I will be there shortly.
 BEVERLY / There... you should start feeling the effect immediately.
 TROI / How completely will it suppress my empathic abilities?
 BEVERLY / It's hard to say for sure... I can raise the dosage if you find it's not enough.
 WORF / -- the cargo bay will be off-limits to all but medical personnel.
 TROI / Good morning.
 WORF / Counselor...
 TROI / Data and Geordi are already in the nacelle room. Are you ready?
 WORF / Yes.
 WORF / (to Troi) I am needed here. I will join you as soon as I can.
 TROI / All right...
 GEORDI / Counselor, you okay?
 TROI / I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to be working. (beat) Have you found anything?
 GEORDI / Nothing unusual.
 TROI / I don't remember seeing this console during my empathic experience. Has it been here since the ship was built?
 GEORDI / No, we installed it about two years ago.
 TROI / I remember seeing some sort of power conduit...
 TROI / (continuing) Right there.
 GEORDI / The main ODN line runs right behind that panel... it lifts out so you can get to it.
 TROI / Can you open it?
 GEORDI / Sure... it'll just take a minute.
 TROI / Lieutenant... the work Lieutenant Kwan was doing, was it unusual in any way?
 GEORDI / Let's set it down right here...
 GEORDI'S VOICE / (off camera) Counselor?
 GEORDI / Are you all right?
 TROI / Something happened... when you took off the panel...
 TROI / (continuing) There must be something there...
 DATA / I am picking up readings that indicate there is organic material imbedded in the wall...
 GEORDI / Organic material?
 GEORDI / (continuing) You're right... let me reconfigure the emitter beam. We might be able to see what it is...
 GEORDI / (continuing) There...
 BEVERLY / This dosage should prevent any further empathic flashes.
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) I'd say these fragments had been in the wall about seven or eight years.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) You said something happened when the panel was opened...
 TROI / Yes...
 BEVERLY / I wonder if the fragments themselves could've somehow triggered your experience. I'll run a resonance scan, see if anything turns up.
 WORF / Apparently the remains are those of an Ensign Marla Finn --
 TROI / That's her. That's the woman I saw.
 BEVERLY / She was reported missing from Utopia Planitia on Stardate 40987.2. Eight years ago...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) How could her body have ended up embedded inside a bulkhead... ?
 WORF / Or she was killed. And the murderer hid her remains.
 TROI / Something's not right... pull up Lieutenant Kwan's service record.
 TROI / (continuing) I thought so... he didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months after Finn's death. (beat) I couldn't have been seeing through his eyes...
 BEVERLY / Then whose... ?
 TROI / It had to have been someone who was at least partially telepathic.
 WORF / Pierce... ?
 BEVERLY / But you saw him there.
 TROI / Yes, but not as clearly as I saw everything else... his face looked...
 TROI / (continuing) Like that.
 BEVERLY / A reflection...
 TROI / (realizing) I was seeing through his eyes.
 TROI / (continuing) And Finn was trying to get away from him; she was afraid of him...
 WORF / I think it is time we had another... conversation with Lieutenant Pierce.
 WORF / (continuing) Ensign Calloway...
 WORF / (continuing) Thank you for your help.
 WORF / Deck ten.
 TROI / Worf... I want to ask you something...
 TROI / (continuing) Do you regret what happened last night?
 WORF / No... of course not.
 TROI / Are you sure? Because I don't want anything to jeopardize our friendship.
 WORF / Deanna... I do not regret being with you.
 WORF / (continuing) Is something wrong?
 TROI / I just... don't feel myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor -- I'm so used to sensing what people are feeling... now I can't.
 WORF / Perhaps I should talk to Lieutenant Pierce alone.
 TROI / That might be a good idea...
 WORF / I will meet you in your quarters.
 TROI / I'll be waiting for you...
 TROI / (continuing) Deck eight.
 TROI / Come in.
 TROI / Security to Counselor Troi's quarters.
 TROI / Where is he?
 TROI / (hits combadge) Troi to Worf.
 TROI / Computer...
 TROI / Where is Lieutenant Worf?
 TROI / Take Lieutenant Pierce to his quarters and hold him there.
 TROI / Security override, authorization Troi Delta-two-nine.
 TROI / Worf...
 TROI / (continuing) Stop it --
 TROI / (continuing) Stop it --
 TROI / No... no...
 TROI / (quiet) I know... what I have to do...
 WORF / What were you doing?
 TROI / You're alive... you're all right...
 WORF / -- I opened the maintenance door at Counselor Troi's request, then turned and saw that she had moved too close to the force-field.
 TROI / It all seemed so real to me. It's hard to imagine that everything I experienced happened in just those few seconds...
 DATA / It appears that you were correct, Counselor. Lieutenant Pierce was partially telepathic -- his maternal grandmother was from Betazed.
 PICARD / What else have you found?
 DATA / According to Starfleet records, Pierce and the other two persons Counselor Troi identified were killed in an accidental plasma discharge eight years ago. Their bodies were never found.
 TROI / I don't believe it was an accident. I think that Pierce found out that the other two were having an affair. He lost control... and killed them both.
 TROI / Afterwards, he probably activated the plasma stream, then threw himself into it.
 WORF / The plasma discharge would have obliterated any evidence that it was murder.
 GEORDI / I scanned behind the panel Counselor Troi asked me to look at. I didn't find any bone fragments... but I did find traces of cellular residue. It's showing some kind of... empathic signature.
 TROI / It may be that when Lieutenant Pierce was struck by the plasma stream, the subspace energy present there imprinted his empathic pattern into the residue.
 GEORDI / Kind of like a... psychic photograph.
 TROI / That's what triggered my hallucination... My mind must have taken elements from my own life and created a situation that in many ways paralleled what happened to Pierce.
 TROI / (continuing) If you hadn't been there, I would have jumped... just like he did...
 WORF / Counselor...
 TROI / Yes?
 WORF / When I pulled you away from the plasma stream, you seemed... surprised that I was alive.
 TROI / Well... actually, in my hallucination... you were killed.
 WORF / May I ask by whom?
 TROI / You know what they say, Worf... (smiles) Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...
 RIKER / Do you know Rebecca White?
 RIKER / (nods) We went for a walk in the Arboretum... we sat down... got comfortable... things got a little romantic...
 RIKER / (continuing) Then I rolled over.
 BEVERLY / I thought we agreed you'd come to me before checking the Starfleet Medical Database.
 BEVERLY / Reg. You don't have Terrelian Death Syndrome.
 BEVERLY / I'm sure.
 BEVERLY / No, no... I don't see anything wrong with you at all...
 BEVERLY / (continuing, off tricorder) Wait a minute... there is a slight imbalance in your K-three cell count.
 BEVERLY / Barclay... I'm sure it's nothing. Let me run a micro-cellular scan...
 BEVERLY / This will take a couple of minutes.
 BEVERLY / (with humor, re: thistles) You should leave a couple of those in... just to teach him a lesson.
 RIKER / (wry) Charming bedside manner...
 DATA ENTERS carrying a cat bed with SPOT in it (NOTE: / Spot should appear to be very PREGNANT). Data sets the basket down on a bio-bed. Beverly moves to him.
 BEVERLY / (re: Spot) How's my smallest patient doing?
 DATA / I believe she is doing well. Her appetite has increased by seven percent, and she is starting to engage in pre-natal behavior.
 BEVERLY / She's getting close. You'll have a fresh litter of hungry kittens before the week is over. Let me run an amniotic scan, just to make sure everything's fine... and then --
 BEVERLY / Alissa, could you take care of Spot for a minute? Start a preliminary amniotic scan...
 BEVERLY / You're right... it's elevated. You've also got heightened electrophoretic activity.
 BEVERLY / Well... based on this, I'd say you've got... (beat) Seventy... maybe eighty years.
 BEVERLY / Yes, Reg. What you have is a mild case of Urodelan Flu. It's nothing serious. Most humans have a natural immunity to it... but it looks like the T-cell in your DNA that would normally fight off this infection is dormant.
 BEVERLY / You have one dormant gene out of a hundred thousand, and I can activate that gene with a synthetic T-cell -- let your body attack the infection naturally.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) You should be fine in a couple of days.
 BEVERLY / Good. Now stay away from that Medical Database... (calls to Riker) And you stay out of the Arboretum.
 DATA / I have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to experience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve the mystery until then.
 BEVERLY / Alissa... ?
 BEVERLY / Alissa, that's wonderful!
 BEVERLY / How did Andrew take the news?
 DATA / (to Ogawa, re: Spot) I have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent. I would be happy to share my insights with your husband. (beat) If my experience is any indication -- he will need all the help he can get.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47653.2. We are performing field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. Mister Worf is supervising the exercises.
 PICARD, RIKER, Data, WORF and ENSIGN DERN at their / stations. Worf is enjoying himself immensely -- he's in his element. Picard, on the other hand, seems a little bored.
 WORF / Our next test will involve the new photon torpedoes. The explosive yield has been increased by eleven percent... and I have enhanced the targeting systems for increased accuracy.
 PICARD / Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf. Please proceed.
 WORF / (with relish) Setting targeting coordinates to zero-zero-five mark three-one-seven... spread pattern delta nine-four... (beat) Torpedoes armed and loaded.
 PICARD / Fire when ready.
 RIKER / Worf?
 WORF / (working) One of the torpedoes has veered off course. It appears to be a malfunction in the guidance system.
 PICARD / Abort and destroy.
 WORF / (works) Torpedo is not responding... the subspace detonator will not engage.
 RIKER / Lock phasers...
 WORF / The torpedo is out of range.
 RIKER / Even with your new, improved phasers?
 PICARD / Maintain a sensor lock on the torpedo -- we'll have to go after it.
 DATA / That would be inadvisable, sir. The asteroid field is unusually dense -- the Enterprise is too large to navigate through it safely.
 PICARD / Then I'll take a shuttlecraft to retrieve it. (to Data) Mister Data, you're with me.
 RIKER / Captain -- the shuttle pilot on duty is Lieutenant Hayes...
 PICARD / I happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot, Number One. (beat) Besides, these... tests hardly require the Captain's personal attention.
 RIKER / Understood. Enjoy yourself, sir.
 PICARD / (on the move) In the meantime, Mister Worf -- you should consider analyzing your new guidance system.
 DATA / (to Picard, on the move) Captain, I will need a few minutes to take care of some personal affairs.
 DATA / (nods) It is possible that it will take several days for Captain Picard and me to complete our mission. I would prefer to have a human present to supervise the birthing process.
 DATA / I have noticed that you are the only other member of the crew whom Spot seems to like.
 DATA / She is to you. However there have been several... injuries when other crewmembers have attempted to care for her.
 DATA / The... "place"?
 DATA / I am not certain. Spot has escaped from my quarters on several occasions. And there are twelve male felines on board. (beat) I intend to run a full DNA analysis on the kittens once they are --
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Data. Report to Shuttlebay Two.
 DATA / (to com) On my way, Captain.
 DATA / (continuing) Goodbye, Spot. I believe you are in... good hands.
 RIKER / Problem?
 WORF / (an edge) I have performed thirteen diagnostics of the weapons array, and I can find nothing wrong with the guidance system.
 RIKER / I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic of the torpedo bay itself... maybe he can find something.
 WORF / (snaps) Must you to stand so close to me?
 RIKER / Lieutenant... are you alright?
 WORF / I am... fine, sir.
 RIKER / No, you're not. You've been working for the past six hours. You're tired. Take a break.
 WORF / But sir --
 RIKER / That's an order, Worf.
 TROI (O.S.) / Thanks for waiting.
 WORF / Do not approach me unannounced -- especially while I am eating.
 TROI / Worf... we were supposed to have lunch together, remember?
 WORF / I was hungry.
 TROI / Well, I'm hungry too...
 TROI / (continuing, to waiter) Bring me an order of... Ongilin caviar. Make that a double order.
 WORF / Caviar... for lunch?
 TROI / I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no stranger than what you're eating.
 TROI / (continuing) Have you noticed how dry the air is on the ship? I wonder if the environmental controls are set properly....
 TROI / (continuing, reacts) You're excused.
 TROI / (continuing) Is something wrong?
 WORF / It has been a difficult day. The torpedo guidance system failed... it was my fault.
 TROI / You always say that, Worf...
 WORF / (a little too loud) It was my fault. I designed the guidance system.
 TROI / Worf... calm down.
 TROI / (continuing) I think you're under more stress than you'd like to admit. Maybe you should get some rest...
 WORF / Yes... perhaps you are right. Excuse me.
 TROI / I didn't mean right now...
 GEORDI and Barclay are reporting to Riker. Barclay is / very animated throughout the scene, bristling with nervous energy and mannerisms -- even more so than usual. It is a very subtle behavioral change, the foreshadowing of a more radical transformation. Riker, on the other hand, seems a little slow -- one step behind the others. This is the subtle beginnings of Riker losing his intellectual capabilities.
 RIKER / (cutting in) Wait... slow down... I lost you back there... (beat) Which sensor cluster?
 GEORDI / (re: PADD) It's all right in here in this diagram, sir.
 RIKER / I'll... take a look at this later. In the meantime, go ahead and run your diagnostic. I'll notify all departments about the power shutdown.
 RIKER / (re: Barclay) He's full of energy today.
 GEORDI / (nods) I can't get him to slow down. He's been working since late last night...
 GEORDI / Hold on, Reg -- I'll go with you! (to Riker, on the move) We'll keep you posted, sir.
 TROI / (to computer) Computer, increase ambient air temperature by two degrees Centigrade... and increase relative humidity another ten percent.
 WORF / (to computer) Computer, reset environmental controls to standard.
 TROI / Worf, it's freezing in here.
 WORF / You have already raised the temperature three times. It is too hot.
 TROI / (firm) Live with it. (to computer) Computer, execute my original command.
 TROI / (continuing) I need a bath... (to Worf) You have the Bridge.
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) Reg... wait a second... look at the corroded edges... and the blast pattern. This conduit didn't just rupture on its own... it looks like something dissolved the bulkhead and ate through the conduit...
 GEORDI / I think so. Whatever dissolved the bulkhead was highly corrosive... but it's not like any solvent I've ever seen...
 GEORDI / (continuing) There's a high level of cholic acid here... enzymatic agents... If I didn't know any better, I'd say this solvent was organic.
 GEORDI / Good idea. But let's take a break first, give ourselves a chance to --
 GEORDI / (quiet) I don't know what's gotten into you, Reg...
 TROI / (to computer) Computer, adjust temperature to twenty-nine degrees Celsius... relative humidity to ninety percent.
 RIKER / It's awfully hot in here.
 WORF / Counselor Troi would not let us turn down the temperature.
 RIKER / Where is she? This is supposed to be her watch.
 WORF / She said she needed... a bath.
 RIKER / A bath?
 WORF / Yes sir.
 WORF / (continuing) Permission to be excused. I am not... feeling well.
 RIKER / The weapon systems... ?
 RIKER / Oh, that's right...
 RIKER / Tell them... we're not finished yet...
 TROI / Worf... what are you doing in here?
 WORF / I had to be with you...
 TROI / Well, as you can see, I'm a little busy right now. Please come back later.
 TROI / (to computer) Computer, increase water temperature by five degrees.
 WORF / Get out of the water. Now.
 TROI / Worf... what do you think you're --
 TROI / Leave me alone, or I'm going to call security.
 TROI / It's just so cold in here... (quickly, to passing N.D.) May I have a glass of water... ?
 BEVERLY / (to Troi) Your temperature has dropped eight degrees. I want to run a hypothalamic series right away.
 BEVERLY / Call Doctor Selar and Doctor Hacopian. We may have some kind of viral infection going around. (beat) I'm going to check on Worf...
 BEVERLY / Worf, have you had any unusual symptoms lately? Headaches... nausea... dizziness?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Worf? Worf... can you hear me?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I think we'd better run a full bio-scan. I want you to lie down.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Worf, lie down...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Okay... we'll do this sitting up.
 BEVERLY / What's this... ?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Worf, how long have you had this on your neck?
 BEVERLY / (continuing, off tricorder) It's full of some sort of bioacidic compound... almost like a venom sack... (beat) Open your mouth.
 RIKER / Are you saying that Mister Worf has been... spraying this... this...
 RIKER / Venom... all over the ship?
 RIKER / I'm having trouble concentrating myself... it's like my mind keeps... wandering... I can't...
 GEORDI / (to Riker) Commander -- I have seven security teams hunting for Worf, but for some reason sensors are having trouble locking onto him. I've called a Level Two Security Alert -- do you think we should go to a Level One?
 RIKER / I... don't know. What do you think?
 GEORDI / I think we should...
 RIKER / Okay... sounds good... then you'll take care of that... security thing, won't you?
 GEORDI / Yes sir.
 RIKER / I'll... contact Starfleet... let them know what's happening. You have your orders. Dismissed.
 RIKER / (to computer) Computer, send a subspace message to Starfleet command... security channel, authorization...
 RIKER / Computer...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. Commander Data and I have recovered the stray torpedo after a three day search. We are enroute back to the Enterprise.
 DATA / Captain, the ship is not at the pre-arranged coordinates.
 PICARD / Have they been delayed?
 DATA / I do not know. I am unable to raise them on any communication channel.
 PICARD / Scan the vicinity... see if you can find them...
 DATA / (off console) The Enterprise appears to be adrift. I am reading power fluctuations on all decks...
 PICARD / Life signs?
 DATA / There are life signs, but the sensor readings are highly distorted. I am unable to identify specific lifeforms.
 PICARD / Adjust our axial stabilizers to match the attitude and rotation rate of the Enterprise... (beat) I'm going to dock the shuttle manually...
 DATA / (off panel) Main power is off-line. All systems are in Emergency or Standby mode... and there is no response from any manned station.
 PICARD / Any sign of the crew?
 DATA / (works) I cannot access the internal sensors from here. We will have to go to the Bridge.
 PICARD / What's that smell?
 DATA / It is a mixture of methane, uric acid and ammonia. There is also an abundance of pheromones in the air.
 PICARD / That sounds like... animals.
 DATA / Yes, sir. I am able to discern over three hundred different vocalizations.
 PICARD / (continuing) Look at this...
 DATA / (off tricorder) It is composed of reptilian DNA... I believe it is an epidermal layer that has been cast off during molting.
 PICARD / But it seems to be humanoid...
 DATA / Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. There are no species aboard the Enterprise that shed their skin in this fashion.
 PICARD / This is Commander Troi's quarters... can you tell if she's inside?
 DATA / No, sir.
 PICARD / I want to take a look inside. Stand ready.
 PICARD / The environmental settings in this room have been altered...
 PICARD / Deanna!
 PICARD / (horrified) What's happened to her... ?
 DATA / (off tricorder) Her DNA is in a state of ribocyatic flux... her genetic codes are being re-sequenced... and her cells are mutating as a result. (beat) At a fundamental level, she is no longer human.
 PICARD / What... is she?
 DATA / (scanning) Her respiratory tissue has become capable of metabolizing water as well as air... and her eyes have developed nictitating membranes... (beat) I believe she has become... amphibian, sir.
 PICARD / She's been injured...
 DATA / There is Klingon DNA in the wound. It is saliva.
 PICARD / You mean, she's been bitten?
 DATA / It would appear so.
 DATA / (re: Troi) I will need to run a full biospectral analysis.
 PICARD / (nods) First we've got to get the ship under control... let's go to the Bridge.
 DATA / His upper spinal column has been broken in three places.
 PICARD / It looks like he's been attacked by some sort of animal... (beat) Has his DNA changed, as well?
 DATA / Yes. However, the mutation was in its initial stages when he died.
 PICARD / (working) I've restored attitude control to the ship. But I can't get main power back on-line... it looks like the entire power transfer grid has been destroyed...
 DATA / (off console) Captain, I am picking up one thousand eleven individual life readings within the ship. All exhibit a genetic flux similar to the one we observed in Counselor Troi.
 PICARD / Then the entire ship has been affected...
 DATA / (off console) Most of the lifeforms are scattered throughout ship's quarters... but there are several large concentrations in the arboretum, and the aquatics lab.
 PICARD / Commander Riker... ?
 PICARD / (reacts) Wil... ?
 DATA / (off tricorder) His cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent -- his brain is much smaller, sir. I doubt he can comprehend our language.
 PICARD / I think he's trying to communicate...
 PICARD / (gently) Wil, can you --
 PICARD / He looks almost... proto-human.
 DATA / Yes, sir. His DNA would seem to confirm that observation.
 DATA / Captain... I believe the crew is de-evolving.
 PICARD / This tranquilizer should keep him unconscious for another seven hours. (beat) What have you found out?
 DATA / I have analyzed Commander Riker's DNA structure. A synthetic T-cell has invaded his genetic code. This T-cell has begun to activate his latent introns.
 PICARD / Introns?
 DATA / They are genetic codes which are normally dormant. They are evolutionary holdovers -- sequences of DNA that provided key physical and behavioral characteristics millions of years ago, but are no longer necessary. (beat) For instance, Counselor Troi's gill slits and other amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still contain amphibious codes.
 PICARD / So these... introns are causing her DNA to re-combine in an earlier configuration?
 DATA / That is correct. In her case, the DNA is creating an amphibious lifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago.
 PICARD / Commander Riker's introns are changing him into one of the earlier hominids...
 DATA / Yes, sir. I would say... Australopithacine. (beat) Each of these stages is another link in the evolutionary chain, stretching back to the origins of all lifeforms on Earth. (beat) Because introns can include genetic material from many different species over millions of years of evolution, it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is occurring among the crew.
 PICARD / What about crewmembers who are not from Earth?
 DATA / All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus should affect non-human crewmembers in the same way. They are each deevolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds.
 DATA / (continuing) I feel I must point out, sir, that you have become infected with the intron virus, as well.
 PICARD / How long before I start to change?
 DATA / According to my calculations, within the next twelve hours, you will begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation.
 PICARD / Which will be what... ?
 DATA / I believe you will also de-evolve into some form of early primate. Possibly similar to a lemur, or pygmy marmoset.
 PICARD / Well... before I begin scurrying about, searching for food, we need to find some answers. (beat) How do we reverse the process?
 DATA / I am uncertain. We will need to run several micro-cellular scans. However, the ship's main computer has been damaged. Possibly by crewmembers who did not know what they were doing. (thinks) The computer in my quarters has an independent processing and memory storage unit, and should not be affected. I suggest we work from there.
 PICARD / Agreed.
 DATA / I believe Spot has had her kittens.
 PICARD / They sound hungry.
 DATA / Yes. I am curious as to why Spot is not taking care of them.
 DATA / Spot... ?
 PICARD / It would seem the intron virus isn't limited to humanoid lifeforms.
 DATA / No, sir.
 PICARD / What is it?
 DATA / These kittens were born within the last twenty-four hours. It appears that Spot's transformation took place at approximately the same time.
 PICARD / So... Spot gave birth to the kittens while she was... changing into a reptilian form?
 DATA / I believe so. For some reason, the intron virus was not passed on to the kittens. I do not know why.
 PICARD / As I remember my biology, there are several natural immune systems that come into play in the womb of the mother... to protect the unborn from viral infections...
 DATA / That is true. The placental barrier, maternal antibodies and amniotic fluid all serve as a filtration system.
 PICARD / Maybe we could... inhibit this intron virus by using some of the natural antibodies in Spot's amniotic fluid...
 DATA / It would take further research, but I believe that to be effective on humanoid crewmembers, humanoid antibodies would be necessary.
 PICARD / Then perhaps we should locate a humanoid who's pregnant...
 DATA / Nurse Ogawa recently became pregnant...
 PICARD / Then we need to locate Nurse Ogawa.
 DATA / I have traced her combadge signal to Deck Seventeen, Section Twentyone Alpha.
 PICARD / The Arboretum...
 DATA / (off console) One of the warp plasma vents has failed. Main Engineering has been abandoned -- there is no one there to fix the problem.
 DATA / I can repair the damaged plasma vent from here.
 PICARD / I'd better check the status of the warp core...
 PICARD / (calls out) Data!
 PICARD / (shaken) What was that?
 DATA / I believe it was Lieutenant Barclay. He appeared to be partially transformed into an arachnid.
 PICARD / A spider?
 DATA / (nods) I recognized the chitin colorations. He is becoming a member of the Pisauridae family.
 DATA / Captain. Are you all right?
 PICARD / I have the most intense feeling of... fear... panic... as if I were being watched... (beat) I can't explain it.
 DATA / You may be experiencing the initial stages of your transformation. Early primates were often prey for larger carnivores -- as a result, their instincts probably included a heightened sense of awareness.
 PICARD / If that's the case, then my instincts tell me... we'd better hurry.
 DATA / Captain.
 DATA / (re: Ogawa) I have analyzed Nurse Ogawa's embryo. It has been unaffected by the virus. I believe I can use her amniotic fluid as a template for a retro-virus. It would neutralize the synthetic T-cell, and re-establish the original genetic patterns of each host.
 PICARD / How soon can you have it ready?
 DATA / It will not take long to isolate the appropriate genetic material. However, I will need to get the Sickbay computer back on --
 PICARD / (anxious) What -- what's that?
 DATA / (off tricorder) It is large, approximately two hundred kilograms... and it is heavily armored with an exoskeleton of some sort... (reacts) The lifesigns appear to be... Klingon.
 PICARD / Worf...
 PICARD / Set your phaser to heavy stun.
 DATA / We have no way of knowing if the stun setting will have any effect on him, sir. And a higher setting may kill him.
 PICARD / (re: howl) Listen to that... he sounds angry... aggressive... (thinks) What does Worf want... is he responding to some sort of predatory instinct? Does he see us as prey?
 DATA / There are crewmembers in the corridors and other sections of the ship. It would be much easier for him to capture and consume one of them, rather than attempt to break through a door.
 PICARD / Then... what does he want? (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (thinking) Predators use vocalizations to frighten off other predators... to mark territory... and to initiate the mating process... (that's it) The mating process...
 PICARD / (continuing) Counselor Troi has been bitten by a Klingon... but it's not in a life-threatening location... nowhere near a major artery or organ...
 PICARD / (continuing) And look at the wound itself... the penetration of the bite is very shallow, as if he didn't intend to seriously injure her...
 DATA / What are you suggesting, Captain?
 PICARD / Is it possible that Worf thinks of Troi as his mate?
 DATA / If that is true, then he must now by trying to reach her.
 PICARD / We... we can't just leave. We've got to stay here and protect her... and keep working on the retro-virus... (thinks) If we can't stun him, then we'll have to distract him somehow... lure him away from Deanna...
 DATA / The mating instinct is quite strong in Klingon biology. I am not certain what would serve as an effective lure.
 PICARD / Klingons have a highly developed sense of smell... if we could duplicate Deanna's pheromones, we might be able to convince him she has left Sickbay... and is somewhere else on the ship...
 DATA / (working) I am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands, where pheromones are produced.
 DATA / (continuing, working) I believe I can activate the pheromones with a bio-activant solution.
 PICARD / Can you amplify the pheromones? They'll have to be far more powerful than Deanna's actual scent.
 DATA / I believe this will produce the desired effect. (beat) I will use it to draw Worf to a different part of the ship.
 PICARD / No... you... you must stay here... continue working on the retro-virus...
 PICARD / (continuing) I'll go...
 DATA / Captain, that would be extremely unwise. Worf may be much faster than --
 PICARD / (urgent) No time... no time to argue.
 DATA / (to computer) Computer -- activate medical database.
 DATA / Computer, bypass database system -- activate local subprocessors only.
 PICARD / (to Lift) Deck Seventeen.
 DATA / (to computer) Computer, display progress of genetic re-sequencing.
 DATA / Computer, increase nucleotide substitution by thirty-two percent.
 DATA / (taps combadge) Data to Captain Picard.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Go ahead.
 DATA / The retro-virus is working. I can release it into the ship's atmosphere in a gaseous state, but it will take some time to take effect.
 PICARD / (to com) Acknowledged.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Are you all right, sir?
 PICARD / I'm fine, Mister Data. Proceed...
 PICARD / (continuing, quiet) Well, Mister Worf... let's hope you wake up feeling like a new man.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data has succeeded in returning the crew to normal. Doctor Crusher has determined that the synthetic T-cell she used to cure Mister Barclay's Urodelan flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship.
 BEVERLY / No... in a way, it was mine. I didn't realize it at the time, but there's an anomaly in your genetic chemistry that caused the synthetic T-cell to mutate... (beat) Instead of just activating one dormant gene, it started to activate all of them -- including your introns.
 BEVERLY / (nods) Along with every other member of the crew. The T-cell became airborne and started to spread like a virus...
 BEVERLY / You know, Reg... this is a completely new disease. And it's traditional to classify a new disease with the name of the first diagnosed patient...
 BEVERLY / That's right. How about... "Barclay's Proto-morphosis Syndrome"?
 TROI / (re: Barclay) He transformed into a spider... and now he's had a disease named after him... (with humor) I think I'd better clear my calendar for the next few weeks.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 47751.2. The Enterprise has arrived at Starbase Three One Zero for a meeting with Fleet Admiral Necheyev. This visit will also give us the opportunity to pick up a... member of the family.
 BEVERLY and WESLEY ENTER from the Corridor. Wesley is / wearing his cadet uniform and is carrying a suitcase.
 BEVERLY / Here you go... your very own quarters. (with humor) And they're as far away from mine as possible, so you won't even have to see me if you don't want to.
 WESLEY / Mom... you know that's not why I asked for my own quarters this --
 BEVERLY / (teasing) No, no. You don't have to explain. There comes a time in a young man's life when he doesn't want to stay with his poor old mother... I understand.
 WESLEY / (wry) I'll come visit you in the old Doctor's Home every Sunday.
 WESLEY / Come in.
 GEORDI and DATA ENTER. / 
 GEORDI / Is there a runaway cadet in here?
 DATA / If so, we may have to call security.
 GEORDI / Welcome back, Wes.
 WESLEY / Thanks.
 DATA / I was, of course, not serious about calling security. It was a joke.
 WESLEY / I got it, Data.
 GEORDI / So... how's life at the Academy?
 WESLEY / Great... just great. (beat) But it's... good to have a break.
 GEORDI / So do you plan on just lounging around while we have work to do?
 WESLEY / I'm... sure I can find some time to help, sir.
 GEORDI / Enjoy your time off, you've earned it.
 WESLEY / Thanks.
 BEVERLY / Well... I think we better let him settle in.
 GEORDI / Good idea. Don't sleep your whole vacation away, Wes.
 DATA / Good-bye.
 WESLEY / See you later.
 BEVERLY / It's really good to have you home, Wesley. Really.
 WESLEY / Thanks, Mom.
 PICARD is setting a teapot on the table where a small / tea service has been laid out. There is also a plate of small sandwiches, and a tray of odd-looking crackers. Riker ENTERS.
 RIKER / Admiral Necheyev's just beamed aboard. Worf's escorting her up here now.
 PICARD / Good.
 RIKER / Earl Grey Tea... watercress sandwiches... Bularian canapes... Are you up for a promotion?
 PICARD / I'm trying to establish a new relationship with the Admiral. There's been a certain amount of... tension between us in the past.
 RIKER / Tension's not the word I would use...
 PICARD / I'd like to get things started on a better note this time. I want to make her feel at ease... that she's welcome aboard the Enterprise...
 RIKER / (innocent) I don't know why she wouldn't feel welcome here.
 PICARD / We don't have to like her Wil, we simply have to follow her orders. However, maintaining an atmosphere of confrontation serves no purpose.
 WORF / Admiral Necheyev, sir.
 PICARD / (warm) Admiral, welcome aboard the Enterprise.
 RIKER / Thank you, Admiral.
 RIKER / Captain...
 PICARD / Admiral, may I offer you some --
 PICARD / Yes, as a matter of fact. I took the liberty of speaking to your aide, Commander Wrightwell... he said you were quite fond of them.
 PICARD / You were saying something about the Cardassians I believe...
 PICARD / (off PADD) This border will put several Federation colonies in Cardassian territory... and some Cardassian colonies in ours.
 PICARD / The colonists are not going to be very happy about that... some of them have been there for decades.
 PICARD / Dorvan Five... that's where the group of North American Indians has settled, isn't it?
 PICARD / (continuing) Admiral... centuries ago, the North American Indians were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands. This group on Dorvan Five originally left Earth two hundred years ago because they wanted to preserve their cultural identities.
 PICARD / There are certain... disturbing historical parallels here. Once again, these people are being asked to leave their homes because of political decisions made by a distant government.
 PICARD / Then perhaps we should not have allowed them to settle the planet originally. But to go to them twenty years later and ask them to leave what is now their home...
 PICARD / What if the Indians should... refuse to evacuate?
 PICARD / No. That won't be necessary.
 PICARD / I understand.
 PICARD / You are always welcome on this ship, Admiral.
 WESLEY / (annoyed) Come in.
 PICARD / Oh. I'm sorry to disturb you, Mister Crusher. I assumed you would be up at this hour. I could come back later.
 WESLEY / No... no, sir. I... must have overslept. Come in.
 WESLEY / (continuing, to replicator) Coffee, black.
 WESLEY / (continuing, to Picard) Oh. Uh, can I get something for you, sir?
 PICARD / No, that's quite all right. This was my first chance to welcome you back.
 WESLEY / Thank you. I appreciate that.
 PICARD / So... how's Boothby?
 WESLEY / Fine, I guess.
 PICARD / You guess?
 WESLEY / I haven't seen him in a while. (beat) To be honest, sir... Boothby was starting to get on my nerves a little bit. (MORE)
 WESLEY (Cont'd) / He always seemed to have an opinion about everything. (then tries to backtrack) I mean, I know he's a very... insightful... intelligent man...
 PICARD / But you'd had enough of his insights.
 WESLEY / That's not quite what I meant, sir.
 PICARD / Well, as I said, welcome back, Mister Crusher. I hope you enjoy your vacation. That's really all I came here to say.
 GEORDI / Wes -- there you are. You've got to take a look at this.
 GEORDI / Remember how we always talked about improving the quantum efficiency by creating a new plasma-dyne relay? Well, feast your eyes on this.
 WESLEY / (dismissive) You've only got one micro-fusion inter-relay in here... the converter interface will never hold up.
 GEORDI / Hey, I ran the diagnostics myself. This little baby will withstand over five hundred Cochranes of warp field stress.
 WESLEY / I don't think so. You better put a secondary phase inverter in there. (beat, pokes around in panel) In fact, this entire subprocessor matrix needs an overhaul.
 GEORDI / Well, I guess we can't have all the fancy new equipment they give you kids at the Academy. We have to make do with what we've got.
 WESLEY / Read the latest paper by Doctor Vassbinder... he has some brilliant new theories on warp propulsion inter-relays. (indicates console) A lot of this stuff is almost obsolete.
 GEORDI / What's wrong with you?
 WESLEY / (hard) Do you want my help or not?
 GEORDI / (bristling) I was doing this for you... I thought you'd be interested in this.
 WESLEY / Well, I'm not.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Supplemental. The Enterprise has arrived at Dorvan Five and I have spoken to the Leader of the Tribal Council. He has agreed to meet with us this afternoon to discuss the situation.
 PICARD / Anthwara... I am afraid there is very little I can do. The decision regarding this planet was made at the highest levels of the Federation.
 PICARD / I must point out that when you first came to this world, you were warned that it was the subject of a dispute between the Federation and the Cardassians. You were asked not to settle here.
 PICARD / I understand and respect the long journey of your people. But I believe we can help you find a new home.
 TROI / As you can see, there are three other planets in this sector that have environmental conditions similar to those here on Dorvan Five. They are all uninhabited... and could be colonized immediately.
 PICARD / And if those worlds don't meet with your approval, then we'll find you other choices.
 PICARD / I can assure you that we will not impose a weather control system or anything else on your people. Whatever world you choose to colonize will be completely yours to do with as you please.
 PICARD / That's not true. I have a great deal of respect for your beliefs and the meaning they hold for your people.
 TROI / Captain, may I suggest that we adjourn for now... allow us all time to think about what's been said.
 PICARD / In the meantime, I would like to invite you all to the Enterprise this evening as our guests.
 BEVERLY / Ever since you came aboard you've been moody, sullen and rude. I want to know what's going on.
 WESLEY / Nothing's going on, Mom. I just want to be left alone.
 BEVERLY / No, that's not good enough. Your behavior in Engineering was inexcusable.
 WESLEY / Well, then that's my business isn't it? I don't need you telling me how to behave.
 BEVERLY / I shouldn't have to -- you're a fourth year Starfleet cadet. You're expected to have a certain level of maturity.
 WESLEY / Maybe I'm sick of living up to other people's expectations... maybe I'm sick of following rules and regulations... did you ever think about that?
 PICARD / ... so I've been trying to familiarize myself with the history and traditions of your people. I was quite interested to learn that it was your grandfather -- Katowa -- who led the group of Indians who initially left Earth two centuries ago.
 PICARD / It must have been a very difficult decision for your grandfather to make... uprooting your people... leading them into the unknown for an undetermined amount of time... not even knowing if you ever would find a new home.
 PICARD / (quiet) It's never easy to leave one's home... to give up the safe and familiar. But there are times when the greater good demands that sacrifices be made... I'm sure your grandfather knew that.
 PICARD / A great deal actually. My father was a strong believer in passing along the family history and traditions.
 PICARD / (smiles) I hope that by the end of this matter, you won't look at me as your opponent. (beat) My family. Well... our roots in Western Europe go back to the time of Charlemagne.
 WESLEY / (to Beverly, quiet) Sorry I'm late.
 BEVERLY / We'll talk about that later.
 WESLEY / Yes?
 WESLEY / I'm... glad to meet you... can I get you a drink or --
 WESLEY / For... me?
 WESLEY / I'm... not sure what you mean.
 WESLEY / I don't mean to be rude, but I wish you'd stop talking about me in the future tense.
 BEVERLY / I just don't know what to do, Jean-Luc. It's as if someone took my son away and left this stranger in his place.
 PICARD / In a sense, that's exactly what's happened. Wesley left here three years ago as a boy... but now he's a young man. That can't be an easy transition for a mother... or a son.
 BEVERLY / Well, it's gone beyond just the two of us...
 PICARD / I heard about the incident with Geordi.
 BEVERLY / Have you heard about the Academy? (off his look) I called Admiral Brand this afternoon. She said his grades are falling... he's becoming remote, defensive... if he's not careful, he'll wash out next term.
 PICARD / I don't mean to make light of that by any means... but I must say that I went through the same thing. (MORE)
 PICARD (CONT'D) / (off her look) Oh, yes. I nearly washed out my sophomore year... there were a lot of different factors... my father's death... a teenage love affair with the wrong girl... the point is, I realized what was happening to me and I pulled myself out of it. I'm sure Wesley will do the same.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc... will you have a talk with him? Maybe this is the kind of thing a boy -- a young man has to discuss with another man.
 PICARD / (gently) I don't think he wants either of us to talk to him right now.
 BEVERLY / But he needs help.
 PICARD / Perhaps. But he has to want that help. If he doesn't, then any effort on our part might only push him further away.
 PICARD / (continuing) Let him work this out on his own, Beverly.
 WESLEY / How long have you been watching me?
 WESLEY / Well, I'm here. What am I supposed to do now?
 WESLEY / I thought you were going to... help me "find some answers".
 WESLEY / (frustrated) What questions? I don't even know why I came here.
 WESLEY / (quiet) I don't know about my... spirit, but I guess you could say I'm a little... troubled.
 WESLEY / Tell me about this... Habak. You said you had some kind of a vision there?
 WESLEY / To me? Uh... well, I consider a lot of things... important... I respect a lot of things... but I don't know if I consider anything sacred.
 WESLEY / Well... maybe some of the designs on the walls... the necklace you're wearing... ?
 WESLEY / I think that's the first time anyone's used that particular word to describe me.
 WESLEY / Is that... what you think I'm doing?
 WESLEY / (quiet) Maybe I don't have... a lot of respect for myself right now.
 PICARD / Anthwara... I deeply regret that we have not been able to reach an agreement. (beat) But, to put it bluntly, I cannot take no for an answer. (beat) This planet will be handed over to the Cardassian government as per the terms of the border agreement. I am very sorry... but you will have to leave.
 PICARD / Then I will be forced... to remove you... by any means necessary.
 PICARD / (firm) This is not a racial issue... it has nothing to do with ancient hatreds... or with the fact that we have different colored skin. I might just as easily have been a Vulcan or Andorian captain. The orders from Starfleet would have been the same.
 PICARD / Anthwara... I may regret doing it, but --
 TROI / I am. Several Indian tribes rose up against their Spanish overlords and drove them out of what is now called New Mexico.
 PICARD / I was... unaware of that incident... or of the man you named. (beat) But that was seven hundred years ago and I don't see how it has any bearing on --
 TROI / Captain... are you all right?
 PICARD / (quiet) We should return to the Enterprise.
 PICARD / (surprised) Mister Worf... what's going on?
 WORF / We have... unwelcome visitors.
 PICARD / I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
 PICARD / May I have a word with you... alone?
 PICARD / (quiet) It was my understanding that there would be no Cardassian presence on this world for another six weeks. Your arrival here may upset some very... delicate negotiations.
 PICARD / I would be happy to explain it to you... but for now, I must ask that you and your men leave... immediately.
 PICARD / Very well... complete your mission... (his voice hardens) But, this is still Federation territory, Gul Evek... until that changes, this world is under my jurisdiction... and I will protect it.
 PICARD / It is a fact... and I suggest you keep it in mind as you conduct your... survey.
 WESLEY / (surprised) Wait a minute. When I asked to come here, you said it would be --
 WESLEY / What are those?
 WESLEY / This one looks like... a Klingon.
 WESLEY / What... should I do?
 WESLEY / What am I waiting for?
 PICARD / No, sir.
 PICARD / Admiral, I have every reason to believe that these people will resist any attempt to remove them. I strongly urge you to request an emergency session of the Federation Council. The issue of Dorvan Five must be reopened.
 RIKER / So much for a reprieve from Starfleet.
 PICARD / Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of one of my ancestors against his people...
 RIKER / Do you believe that?
 PICARD / No, of course not. I respect their beliefs... but that can't have any bearing on our mission. (beat) But at the same time... I wonder if a dark chapter in my family history is about to repeat itself. (off Riker's look) If these people take up arms against us... there's no way to foresee the consequences.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Worf. Will you come in here for a moment?
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Worf... begin preparations to remove the inhabitants from Dorvan Five.
 WORF / Aye, sir.
 WESLEY / Dad...
 WESLEY / The end... the end of what?
 WESLEY / You mean... when you died.
 WESLEY / I... don't understand.
 WESLEY / I... don't understand.
 WESLEY / Dad -- wait!
 WORF / (concerned) Mister Crusher... Are you all right?
 WESLEY / Yeah... I'm fine, Worf...
 WORF / (quiet, to N.D.) Lay out a confinement beam trace along the Southwestern edge of the village. Be discreet -- we do not wish to alarm the population.
 WESLEY / What are you doing?
 WORF / We are laying out Transporter coordinates for a security perimeter. It may become necessary to remove these people by force.
 WESLEY / Worf... we can't do this. These people deserve better than to be taken from their homes...
 WORF / I understand. But this is not the time or the place to --
 WESLEY / (to villagers) Do you know what they're doing? They're preparing to beam you away -- to take you to their ship! You're not going to just let them do that, are you?
 PICARD / (furious) Inexcusable. You defied the orders of the ranking officer on the scene... put the entire Away Team in jeopardy... and made an already tense situation worse. Your actions reflect poorly on this ship and on that uniform. I want an explanation Mister Crusher, and I want it now.
 WESLEY / (steady) What you're doing down there is wrong.
 WESLEY / Captain, these people aren't just some random group of colonists... they're a unique culture... one that predates the Federation and Starfleet...
 PICARD / (interrupting) That does not change the fact that my orders are to --
 WESLEY / I know Admiral Necheyev gave you an order and that she was given an order from the Federation Council... but it's still wrong.
 PICARD / (hard) That is not your decision to make, Cadet. (beat) Now, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, and right now I don't care. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / But I will tell you this -- while you wear that uniform, you will obey every order you're given and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules of conduct. Is that clear?
 WESLEY / Yes, it is. (beat) But I'm not going to wear this uniform anymore. I'm resigning from the Academy.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Captain.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Number One.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Gul Evek wants to meet with you to discuss the... situation on the surface.
 PICARD / Let him come aboard. I'll meet with him in here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Aye, sir.
 BEVERLY / Why are you doing this?
 WESLEY / I told you, Starfleet's not for me.
 BEVERLY / Dammit, Wesley.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I may not be able to stop you from throwing your entire life away, but you are going to stand here and explain it to me first. You owe me that much.
 WESLEY / (quiet) I saw Dad today. He told me not to follow him.
 BEVERLY / You... what?
 WESLEY / I... was participating in an Indian ritual... I had a vision. And in it... Dad came to me. He told me not to follow him... that I had to find my own path.
 BEVERLY / (incredulous) Is that what this is all about? Some mystical vision told you to leave the Academy and now you're packing your bags?
 WESLEY / It's more than that... I think I've known this was the right thing to do for a long time... I just couldn't admit it to myself.
 BEVERLY / But you always said being at the Academy was... the best thing that ever happened to you.
 WESLEY / I know. And for a while it was. But as time went on... and graduation got closer... I started feeling... depressed. I thought it would go away... but it only got worse.
 BEVERLY / Why didn't you ever say anything?
 WESLEY / I guess I didn't want to disappoint you... or Captain Picard... or my friends. You were all so... proud of me.
 BEVERLY / I'd be proud of you regardless of what you were doing, Wes. I love you no matter what.
 WESLEY / I know that, Mom. Maybe the truth is that I was afraid of disappointing myself. (beat) I just never questioned the fact that someday I'd be in Starfleet. (beat) But when Dad said not to follow him, I just knew he was right. It seems... so clear now.
 BEVERLY / Maybe it's partly my fault... I never realized the kind of pressure we all must've put on you... to be exactly what we expected you to be...
 WESLEY / I don't blame you, Mom. It was my decision -- it always has been.
 BEVERLY / You remember the alien from Tau Ceti who could control warp fields with his mind... ?
 WESLEY / (nods) The Traveller.
 BEVERLY / He told Captain Picard a long time ago that you were... special -- like Mozart. That you were destined for something... different from the rest of us... Maybe... this is the first step...
 BEVERLY / What are you planning to do now?
 WESLEY / Well, for the time being... I'm going to stay with these Indians.
 BEVERLY / Wes... you realize they won't be down there much longer. The Captain's orders are pretty explicit on that point.
 WESLEY / I know. But I have to go back... even if it's just for a while.
 BEVERLY / I love you, Wes.
 WESLEY / I love you, too.
 WESLEY / Why?
 WORF / (to Wakasa) Why have you taken these men prisoner?
 WORF / The terms of the treaty do give them the right to... survey this planet.
 WORF / (sotto, to com) Worf to Picard. An armed group of Indians has taken two Cardassian prisoners. The situation is extremely volatile. Request instructions.
 PICARD / Stand-by, Mister Worf. (urgent, to Evek) Have your ship lock-on to your people and beam them out of there now, before something happens.
 PICARD / Gul Evek, those people down there are Federation citizens and I am sworn to protect them. If your troops attack the village, my security forces will respond...
 PICARD / I do. That's why we need to stop this now, before it's too late.
 WORF / I cannot allow you to hold these men as prisoners.
 WESLEY / I don't understand...
 WESLEY / Who are you?
 WESLEY / (continuing, shocked) The Traveller...
 WESLEY / So my experience in the Habak... my vision of my father... the things he said to me... those were all your doing?
 WESLEY / What about them? I can't just leave them like this.
 WESLEY / (anguished) But...
 RIKER / The Cardassian ship is powering its weapons and Transporters.
 PICARD / Evek, the last war caused massive destruction... took millions of lives. Don't send our two peoples back down that path... not like this. History is in your hands -- right now. Give us one last chance for peace.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Beam up our Away Team immediately, Number One.
 RIKER / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Anthwara... I want to make absolutely sure you understand the implications of this agreement. By giving up your status as Federation citizens... any future request you or your people make for assistance from Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your own... and under Cardassian jurisdiction.
 PICARD / It will take some doing... but with Admiral Necheyev's support, I think they'll go along with it in the end.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log: Stardate 47755.3. The Enterprise is preparing to leave Dorvan Five. But former cadet Wesley Crusher will be staying behind. It seems that during the crisis, he met... an old friend.
 PICARD / Where will you go?
 WESLEY / The Traveller said that my... studies will begin with these people. He said they're... aware of many things... and that I could learn a lot from them. (with humor) Just what I needed... more studying.
 BEVERLY / Somehow I think you'll manage.
 WESLEY / Me too.
 PICARD / Well... good luck, Mister... (with affection) ... good luck Wesley.
 WESLEY / Thank you, sir. For a lot of things.
 BEVERLY / (laughing and crying) Remember to... dress warmly in those... other planes of existence.
 WESLEY / (laughing) I will. (beat) Good-bye, Mom.
 PICARD / (to N.D.) Energize.
 WORF / -- as time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a man. What is not inevitable, is that a man become a warrior. A warrior must be forged like a sword, tempered by... (searches for word) -- by experience. The path of the warrior begins --
 WORF / Alexander --
 WORF / Come in.
 WORF / What is the meaning of this?
 WORF / I asked you to meet me here after school. I have been waiting for you.
 WORF / You forgot because you allowed yourself to be distracted by foolishness.
 WORF / There is something important I want to discuss with you.
 WORF / (continuing) As time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a man. What is not inevitable, is that a man become a sword --
 WORF / I meant warrior...
 WORF / (continuing) The path of the warrior begins with the First Rite of Ascension.
 WORF / No, that is the Second Rite.
 WORF / You are approaching the age of ascension... it is time for you to prepare for the ceremony.
 WORF / Your fighting skills will be tested... and your knowledge of the teachings of Kahless. It is very challenging, but I will help you prepare.
 WORF / (continuing) This is a kor'tova candle... it represents the fire that burns in a warrior's heart.
 WORF / (continuing) When you light yours, you will be declaring your intention to become a warrior.
 WORF / (continuing) Go ahead.
 WORF / If you do not participate in the rite before you are thirteen years of age, you will never be able to become a true Klingon warrior.
 WORF / You may not care now, but someday you might.
 WORF / It is your decision... but --
 WORF / Alexander --
 PICARD / As a result, the Kearsarge won't be able to rendezvous with us for another four days.
 RIKER / Will we be holding position here until it arrives?
 PICARD / Yes. And, as it looks as though we'll have a few days of relative quiet, I'm going to take advantage of the time by visiting the Hatarian System. There are ancient ruins there just being excavated.
 DATA / The delay will also make it possible for Stellar Dynamics to complete their study of the Vodrey Nebula.
 RIKER / I'll let them know they can have more access to the lateral sensor grid.
 PICARD / (to Worf) This might be a good time to recalibrate the weapon targeting array.
 PICARD / (continuing) Mister Worf?
 WORF / Yes, sir. I will begin the procedure immediately.
 PICARD / Very good. (to all) Dismissed.
 PICARD / (continuing, to Worf) Lieutenant... could I have a word with you?
 PICARD / (continuing) Several times during the briefing you seemed a bit... distracted.
 WORF / I apologize. In the future, I will make sure my personal affairs do not interfere with my duties.
 PICARD / Is everything all right?
 WORF / I... am having problems with Alexander. He has made it clear that he does not wish to participate in the First Rite of Ascension.
 PICARD / I see...
 WORF / I have tried to tell him that it is an important part of a young Klington's life, but he does not understand...
 PICARD / He's had so little opportunity to spend time among Klingons... I doubt if he fully appreciates what a rich cultural heritage he comes from.
 WORF / The festival of Kot'baval begins tomorrow. If he could take part in it, he would see that there is much more to Klingon life than what I have been able to show him... if only we were nearer the homeworld.
 PICARD / What about the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four... I'm sure they'll celebrate the festival there.
 WORF / Yes... but the outpost is on the far side of the Vodrey Nebula, it is three days away by shuttle...
 PICARD / The Enterprise could be there in a fraction of that time, and still be back here for our rendezvous.
 WORF / Sir, I could not ask you to --
 PICARD / I'm willing to bet Stellar Dynamics would like nothing better than to make a trip around the Nebula; it'll give them the chance to study it that much more thoroughly.
 WORF / Bok'ta ku'mo. (over here)
 GEORDI / Who's that?
 WORF / That is the tyrant Molor. He was so strong that no one could stand against him.
 BEVERLY / What's he saying?
 WORF / He is asking if anyone else will have the courage to stand up to Molor...
 WORF / Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!
 WORF / (defiant) O'tak tu'ro!
 WORF / (continuing) Nok'tar be'got?
 WORF / (continuing) Hosh'ar te'not?
 WORF / You fought well.
 WORF / Only one man can stand against Molor.
 WORF / Kahless would rather die than live under Molor's tyranny...
 WORF / Where have you been?
 WORF / We?
 WORF / What for?
 WORF / That is impossible. Molor died centuries ago.
 WORF / He is trying to take your money.
 WORF / No. It is late. We should go home.
 WORF / Alexander.
 WORF / Come, it is time to go.
 WORF / You can see your friends again tomorrow.
 WORF / If you want to.
 WORF / Alexander, run --
 WORF / I've seen you somewhere before. Who are you?
 WORF / Are you... K'mtar?
 WORF / (gesturing to K'mtar) He is gin'tak to the house of Mogh...
 RIKER / Gin'tak?
 WORF / An advisor so trusted that he is made part of a family.
 RIKER / Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
 RIKER / One of my officers was almost killed. That makes it my concern.
 RIKER / Why didn't you warn him before the attack was made?
 WORF / One of the attackers dropped this dagger. (gestures) The design... represents the house of Duras.
 RIKER / What do you think they're after?
 WORF / We can not allow their attack on our house to go unanswered.
 RIKER / At one point they were at Deep Space Nine, trying to sell bilitrium explosives.
 RIKER / Maybe we can find out. (beat) We've arranged quarters for you, if you'd like to stay aboard.
 WORF / K'mtar, why did you treat Commander Riker so disrespectfully?
 WORF / You were... rude.
 WORF / I have not forgotten... I am merely pointing out that their ways our different from ours.
 WORF / Of course I have.
 WORF / Does my brother doubt my ability to raise my son as a Klingon?
 WORF / No... it has not been easy.
 WORF / He is learning... he could be better.
 WORF / Actually... Alexander has not committed himself to undergoing the rite.
 WORF / I have tried to make him see how important it is, but he will not listen to me.
 WORF / I would be grateful for any help you could give.
 WORF / Of course.
 RIKER / Any luck?
 DATA / Starfleet records contain no mention of the Duras sisters after their departure from Deep Space Nine.
 RIKER / Have you been able to make contact with Deep Space Nine?
 WORF / I am being patched through now, sir...
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / (a greeting) Quark...
 RIKER / I see you remember me.
 RIKER / And how could I forget that you didn't have enough latinum to cover my winnings?
 RIKER / Not exactly. You can spend latinum just about anywhere. Those vouchers are only good at your bar.
 RIKER / Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something else.
 RIKER / I'm looking for some Klingon friends of mine... the Duras sisters -- Lursa and B'Etor?
 RIKER / I thought you might know where they went.
 RIKER / Commander Sisko said if anyone would know, you would...
 RIKER / What kind of rumor?
 RIKER / And how much is your "confidence" worth?
 RIKER / Enough for twelve bars of latinum.
 RIKER / I'll be glad to return them.
 RIKER / What for?
 RIKER / All right. (beat) I'll send you those vouchers...
 RIKER / So long, Quark...
 RIKER / How long would it take us to reach the Kalla system?
 WORF / (off console) Approximately sixteen hours.
 RIKER / Why would he? I'd just end up knocking on his door again in a few days -- and I wouldn't be in as good a mood.
 RIKER / Take us out of orbit.
 WORF / (to Alexander) Today we will work on the Koh'manara block... it is a combination of the koh'bala pivot and the pak'ara thrust -- the forms I taught you last week.
 WORF / Alexander, have I not taught you to treat your sword with respect?
 WORF / You must master the forms before you can apply them.
 WORF / What kind of program?
 WORF / Yes, he's going to have to shift it to regain his balance.
 WORF / You should have killed him when you had the chance.
 WORF / K'mtar... enough.
 WORF / Alexander --
 DATA / We are approaching Kalla Three.
 RIKER / Assume a standard orbit. (to Worf) Any evidence of a mining operation?
 WORF / (off console) A shaft has been cut through the outer crust... there is evidence of machinery, but it does not appear to be in use.
 RIKER / Life signs?
 DATA / It is difficult to say. The magnesite is interfering with bioreadings.
 RIKER / (to Data) Assemble an Away Team.
 GEORDI / Who are you?
 WORF / What are you doing on this planet?
 DATA / Then you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities.
 DATA / I suspect that you are feigning ignorance.
 WORF / We are looking for two Klingon women, sisters --
 GEORDI / Actually we were hoping you did.
 DATA / Would you be willing to share your information with us?
 GEORDI / Does your personal code of conduct tell you that when you're stranded on a planet with no way off, you shouldn't try to cut deals?
 DATA / We could certainly provide you with passage off this planet in exchange for information.
 GEORDI / Don't push your luck. (beat) But if you can get us to the Duras sisters, I'll see what I can do.
 WORF / Where are they now?
 DATA / What kind of ship do they have?
 WORF / And where have they gone?
 DATA / Gather your belongings. It is time to leave.
 WORF / As am I.
 WORF / When he came to live with me, he knew nothing of our ways. (beat) He often reminds me of things his mother said to him... I try not to disregard her wishes, I want him to honor her memory...
 WORF / I know. He has not put in the time he needs to learn the skills.
 WORF / Send him... to Ogat?
 WORF / I want him to learn our ways, but... this is his home.
 WORF / He is my son; he belongs with me.
 WORF / Enough... the decision is mine.
 WORF / You would challenge my fitness to raise my own son?
 TROI / -- if K'mtar invoked ya'nora kor, your vote would cancel his, and it would be up to your brother to decide who would get custody of Alexander.
 WORF / I am confident my brother would not vote against me.
 TROI / You don't sound confident...
 WORF / Perhaps I should let Alexander know what is at stake... it might induce him to spend more time training.
 TROI / I'm not sure that's a good idea... it might scare him.
 WORF / I should have tried harder... I should have taken him to visit the homeworld...
 TROI / Worf... Alexander is part human, and that part of him is every bit as important as his Klingon side. I think you've done a wonderful job of exposing him to both sides of his heritage.
 WORF / But by doing that, I may have made it impossible for him to be accepted as a true Klingon.
 TROI / There are those who'd say you're not a true Klingon, just because you wear that uniform.
 TROI / (continuing) The truth is you've found a balance within yourself, a balance that feels right to you. You have to trust that Alexander will be able to find his own balance. Just as you did.
 WORF / Part of me wants to give him that freedom... but what if he turns away from his Klingon heritage? What will happen to my father's house? Who will lead it?
 RIKER (V.O.) / First Officer's Log, stardate 47779.4. We've entered the Ufandi system, where we believe the Duras sisters might have come to sell the ore they mined on Kalla Three.
 DATA / (off console) I am detecting a vessel holding position near the third planet... (works) It is a Yridian freighter.
 RIKER / Put it on screen.
 RIKER / Scan for magnesite in its hold.
 DATA / The resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite ore present...
 RIKER / Then we're too late. The sisters have already been here.
 TROI / Somehow I doubt the Yridians are going to be very forthcoming about where they might have gone...
 DATA / (off console) Sir, readings indicate that there are only five hundred kilograms of ore in the Yridian's hold...
 WORF / There should be over ten thousand kilograms...
 RIKER / That's odd... (to Worf) Hail them.
 RIKER / (continuing) I'm Commander Riker of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
 RIKER / Our sensors indicate you're carrying magnesite ore...
 RIKER / Where did you get it?
 RIKER / Where's this... Corvallen now? I have orders to acquire some magnesite.
 RIKER / Wouldn't you be interested in selling me the ore you're carrying?
 RIKER / You haven't heard my offer.
 RIKER / Half a gram of Anjoran bio-mimetic gel.
 RIKER / Once we've verified the ore's purity, we'll beam over the gel.
 TROI / You're up to something...
 RIKER / Have the Transporter Room beam the ore to these coordinates.
 DATA / (off console) Sir, that would place the ore directly off the ship's starboard bow.
 RIKER / I know.
 WORF / (off console) Transport complete.
 RIKER / Lock phasers on the ore and fire.
 WORF / Firing.
 WORF / A Bird of Prey...
 RIKER / Put a tractor beam on it.
 TROI / How did you know?
 RIKER / The Yridians had only part of the shipment in their hold -- I realized we must've arrived before they had the chance to transfer the rest.
 WORF / Sir, the Klingon ship is hailing us.
 RIKER / On screen.
 RIKER / I don't think so.
 RIKER / We know you're dealing in stolen ore.
 RIKER / (continuing) But what I really want to talk about is the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf.
 RIKER / We have evidence that you were behind it.
 RIKER / Beam over and we'll show you.
 WORF / This was dropped by one of the assassins...
 WORF / (continuing) It bears the crest of your house.
 TROI / Why would someone do that?
 WORF / (under his breath) You can't tarnish a rusted blade...
 WORF / Gir'nak tovo'sor!
 RIKER / Mister Worf --
 RIKER / (continuing) You said you had other evidence they were involved.
 RIKER / Then we'll set a course there. I want this cleared up.
 TROI / What is it?
 WORF / I was not aware you had a son.
 WORF / I will talk to K'mtar.
 WORF / K'mtar... why are you doing this?
 WORF / You will have to kill me.
 WORF / What?
 WORF / What... are you saying?
 WORF / P'tak! Tell me the truth or I will kill you.
 WORF / I could have seen you on the Homeworld...
 WORF / If you are Alexander... you will remember the final words your mother said as she died.
 WORF / How... have you done this? Come to this time?
 WORF / And you did it... in order to end your own life?
 WORF / Why? What is going to happen that is so terrible?
 WORF / I don't believe that...
 WORF / You mustn't blame yourself.
 WORF / That's why you wanted to take Alexander away. To turn him into a warrior, not a peacemaker.
 WORF / But when I die... I would like an honorable death. And the only way that is possible -- is for you accept yourself, as you are, and stay true to what you believe.
 WORF / The cause of peace is a worthy one... go back, and continue to work for it. Your struggle must continue.
 WORF / No... you've already changed things more than you realize.
 WORF / I'm talking about myself.
 WORF / (continuing) You have given me a glimpse into my son's future. I see now that he has his own destiny... and I believe it will be a great one...
 WORF / And I you, Alexander...
 WORF / He had to leave... he was called away...
 WORF / He asked me to say goodbye for him.
 WORF / He wanted me to tell you that no matter what happens, no matter what you decide to do with your life, he'll always care about you a great deal.
 WORF / It may be a long time...
 WORF / Alexander... there will be plenty of time for training. Why don't we... just spend some time together?
 RIKER, DATA and WORF are at their usual stations, along / with assorted SUPERNUMERARIES. There's a feeling of urgency in the air. PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room.
 PICARD / Report.
 RIKER / There's an object of some kind closing in on our position.
 PICARD / On screen.
 DATA / (off console) It appears to be an unmanned probe -- approximately half a meter in diameter. It has no identifiable armaments.
 WORF / We are being hailed...
 WORF / (to Picard) You are being hailed, sir -- by name.
 PICARD / Open a channel.
 PICARD / This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the --
 WORF / I am reading a power surge --
 RIKER / Shields up.
 DATA / The beam appears to contain holographic imaging information...
 RIKER / It's trying to project something...
 PICARD / Isolate the bandwidth and let the signal through the shields.
 PICARD / Bok...
 BOK / I trust you remember me, Picard, because I haven't forgotten you... or how you murdered my son...
 BOK / For fifteen years I've thought about how to avenge his death... but nothing I could do to you could equal what you did to me... until now.
 BOK / You thought you could hide him from me, didn't you? But I found out about him... Jason Vigo is as good as dead.
 BOK / I'm going to kill your son, Picard, just like you killed mine...
 PICARD / (to Worf) Put a tractor beam on that probe and determine if it's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from.
 PICARD / Mister Data, see if there's any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federation records. (beat) You might start with Miranda Vigo -- she was born on New Gaul about forty years ago...
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Contact the Ferengi Government and find out what you can about Bok. He was wearing a Daimon's uniform -- if he's regained his rank, I want to know why.
 PICARD / Come.
 RIKER / The Ferengi Government is debating an amendment to the Rules of Acquisition... (wry) -- it might be a while before they get back to us...
 RIKER / Data found out that the woman you mentioned does have a son named Jason.
 RIKER / This is the most recent picture we could find.
 PICARD / How old is the boy now?
 RIKER / Twenty three.
 RIKER / He and his mother left Earth about six years ago and settled on Camor Five. That's all we know, the planet's records are practically non-existent.
 PICARD / Picard to Bridge. Set course for the Camor system, warp five.
 PICARD / Wil... I appreciate your not asking, but you have the right to know...
 PICARD / There is a possibility that the boy is my son... I was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years ago. I met her through a friend during shore-leave on Earth. It was all very romantic... (smiles) -- probably because we both knew I'd be leaving in two weeks... we kept in touch for a short while, but we never managed to get together again...
 RIKER / And she never said anything about being pregnant... ?
 PICARD / No... either Bok's got it wrong and I'm not the father, or Miranda decided she wanted to raise the child on her own. Quite frankly it wouldn't surprise me. She was very independent... very strong-willed...
 RIKER / You'd have to be to get by on Camor Five.
 PICARD / Whether he's really my son or not, the fact is he's in danger. Bok tried to kill me six years ago... I have no doubt he intends to make good on his threat against the boy...
 RIKER / Anything?
 WORF / There are no Ferengi vessels within range of our scanners...
 DATA / Captain, I have been unable to find any information about Jason Vigo's current whereabouts...
 PICARD / What about his mother's?
 DATA / No, sir.
 PICARD / Miranda was trained as a botanist... she used to talk about running a farm some day. We might start with the agricultural areas.
 DATA / That would significantly narrow our search; the only cultivated land is on the southern continent, and there are relatively few people engaged in agricultural activities.
 PICARD / There can't be too many non-Camorites among them. Try scanning for human life-signs.
 DATA / I am detecting seven humans... three are female... however they are all too young to be Miranda Vigo.
 PICARD / What about males?
 DATA / One is an infant... another is elderly... and two are middleaged.
 PICARD / That's seven, you said there were eight humans.
 DATA / (works) I am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth... (works console) -- the individual appears to be located approximately two kilometers beneath the planet's surface.
 PICARD / Male or female?
 DATA / (off console) Male... adult... between twenty and thirty years old.
 RIKER / No one in their right mind would go that far underground alone.
 PICARD / Unless he was forced to.
 WORF / (off console) Sir, I am reading seismic instability in the area. He is in danger.
 PICARD / Relay his coordinates to the Transporter Room and have them beam him aboard.
 PICARD / That's right. I'm Captain Picard... Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / We thought you were in danger.
 PICARD / Are you Jason Vigo?
 PICARD / In a manner of speaking... someone's made a threat against his life.
 PICARD / Jason... I'm an old friend of your Mother's. I came here because you're in danger.
 PICARD / The person who made the threat is under the impression that... that you are my son...
 PICARD / I don't know...
 PICARD / Perhaps we should contact her... ?
 PICARD / I'm sorry...
 PICARD / Jason... I think it's important that we find out one way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test?
 PICARD / Once he's made aware of the fact, I expect he won't...
 BEVERLY draws blood from Jason's neck with a DEVICE / that looks like a hypospray. She takes the blood sample over to the Sickbay computers, and while she executes the genetic test, Picard and Jason continue to talk.
 PICARD / What were you doing down in that cave? Are you a seismologist?
 PICARD / Without an antigrav harness... ?
 PICARD / So... what do you do?
 PICARD / I see...
 BEVERLY / Excuse me, gentlemen, but I have the results if you want to hear them.
 BEVERLY / (to Jason) Your genetic code is a cross between the DNA of your mother, Miranda Vigo, and your father -- Jean-Luc Picard.
 PICARD / Archaeological fragments I've collected over the years...
 PICARD / (continuing) This is a Silvan glyph stone...
 PICARD / (continuing) And this is a Gorlan prayer stick... it's extremely rare...
 PICARD / Not really. Only to students of archaeology like myself. Still, I had to give up a very old bottle of Saurian brandy for it.
 PICARD / Perhaps... but I value it nonetheless...
 PICARD / Would you like some tea?
 PICARD / Something else?
 PICARD / Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
 PICARD / Well. I'm sure this whole thing is as much a surprise to you as it is to me...
 PICARD / I'll be honest with you, Jason. I was with your mother for only a short time. I would like to have known her better... but it didn't work out that way.
 PICARD / You look a lot like her -- it's your eyes, I think...
 PICARD / (continuing) I want to be clear about one thing -- your mother didn't tell me about you. If she had... I would have been part of your life.
 PICARD / It would be best if you stayed aboard the Enterprise... until we can resolve the situation with Bok.
 PICARD / Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship that was under his son's command. Apparently Bok feels it would be fitting vengeance to kill my son.
 PICARD / Of course not. We're trying to locate Bok... I intend to confront him, settle this matter.
 PICARD / I assure you -- no one's more eager to get this behind us than I am.
 PICARD / We'll give you quarters.
 PICARD / Jason... your being here... I hope it will give us the chance to get to know each other.
 GEORDI / We managed to shut down the probe's power systems so we could beam it aboard, but it's not going to be easy to figure out where it came from.
 DATA / Bok took the precaution of encrypting the probe's navigational systems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path.
 GEORDI / We ran an analysis of the probe's hull -- from the energy signatures and particle deposits we found, it looks like it travelled through a Dichromic Nebula, was exposed to an intensive gravimetric distortion, and passed within a light year of a class four pulsar.
 DATA / Those phenomena are relatively common -- we would need to identify at least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path.
 PICARD / Understood.
 WORF / (off console) Sir, incoming message from Daimon Birta.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Thank you for taking the time to talk to us, Daimon.
 PICARD / Yes, it concerns Daimon Bok.
 PICARD / But he's no longer there?
 PICARD / Buy himself out?
 PICARD / Considering that he is dangerous and unstable, I trust you've kept track of him?
 PICARD / I see. Do you have any idea of his present whereabouts?
 PICARD / That cluster consists of over twenty star systems...
 GEORDI / Believe it or not, sir -- that might've given us the fix we needed. There's a nebula in the Dorias cluster that matches the particle signature we found on the probe.
 DATA / (working) There is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula -- my calculations indicate that the probe was launched in the Xendi Kabu system.
 PICARD / (to helm) Plot a course and take us out of orbit.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc... come in.
 PICARD / I think I need to talk to a parent.
 BEVERLY / What's he like?
 PICARD / I'm not sure I can tell you. He's put up so many barriers... I don't really know what's underneath.
 BEVERLY / It would certainly be understandable if he couldn't accept you right away...
 PICARD / I can't imagine that he'll ever accept me. He won't even talk to me.
 BEVERLY / Keep in mind... he's had twenty years to be angry that his father wasn't there... it'll take time to get over those feelings -- but I think it's possible.
 PICARD / Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong of me to force the issue.
 PICARD / (continuing) He's made it clear he doesn't want to pursue a relationship... I believe I should respect his feelings.
 BEVERLY / Of course you want to take your cues from him... move slowly... but you might want to keep trying to get through those barriers.
 PICARD / What I sense about this young man... is that he's very independent. (beat) I think it's best if I leave him alone. Let him come to me if he wants.
 BEVERLY / Maybe you're right. (beat) I just think you should consider one thing.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Are you really thinking about what's best for Jason... or easiest for you?
 TROI / Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi... the ship's Counselor.
 TROI / No... I just came to see how you were doing. A lot's happened in the last few hours... I thought you might want to talk about it.
 TROI / But you've never met your father before.
 TROI / It must be somewhat overwhelming...
 TROI / Of course. That's only natural.
 TROI / How did you feel about the Captain -- about your father?
 TROI / I was born on Betazed...
 TROI / Jason... I came here to talk to you because I'm the ship's counselor... if you don't want to talk to me in that way, I think I should go.
 TROI / You're welcome to make an appointment to come by my office.
 BOK / (off screen) Picard... can you hear me?
 BOK / (continuing) I will kill him, Picard. And there's nothing you can do about it.
 PICARD / Security to Captain's quarters.
 WORF / Our shields were up; how could he have beamed through them?
 GEORDI / I don't think he did. Sensor logs don't show any sign of an intruder.
 PICARD / Could it have been another hologram?
 GEORDI / I don't think so... something has to generate a hologram -- we would have detected it.
 PICARD / Bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate.
 GEORDI / That device gave off a very specific energy signature... I'm not reading anything like it.
 WORF / Could he have modified the device so he could use it without being detected?
 GEORDI / It's possible... I'll recalibrate the sensors to scan for low intensity transmissions. And just to be sure, I'll sweep your quarters with a resonance scanner.
 PICARD / Good. Keep me posted.
 PICARD / I want you to assign a security detail to Jason.
 WORF / What about yourself?
 PICARD / I'm not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is.
 DATA / Captain, I have compiled all available records pertaining to Jason Vigo's criminal record, and --
 PICARD / (cutting him off) His criminal record?
 DATA / Yes, sir. He has been charged three times for petty theft, twice for disorderly conduct, and several dozen times for trespassing.
 PICARD / Trespassing?
 DATA / I believe the charges were related to his climbing activities in the caves underneath the planet's surface.
 DATA / (continuing) This is the information you requested, is it not?
 PICARD / Yes, thank you.
 PICARD / (off-screen) Good morning...
 PICARD / Because... Bok appeared in my quarters last night.
 PICARD / It may not have been Bok -- just an image of him. We're investigating.
 PICARD / I don't think that's wise...
 PICARD / I know you have. But Bok is extremely dangerous. He has a starship, technology --
 PICARD / You seem to enjoy rock climbing. Our Holodeck can create some very challenging climbs.
 PICARD / (continuing) Why don't I take you down there and show you how to use the programs?
 PICARD / Perhaps we could do a climb together... (off Jason's look) I'm probably not as skilled as you, but I'm not inexperienced.
 PICARD / Of course. (beat) There are other sports programs... fending, for example. Have you ever fenced?
 PICARD / I think it might appeal to you. It's very physical... demanding --
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47829.1. We've been in the Xendi Kabu system for over three hours, and still no sign of Bok.
 DATA / I have completed a subspace scan... there is an energy residual that suggests that a Ferengi vessel, possibly several, was in this area within the last eighteen hours.
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Bridge.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 GEORDI / I've scanned your quarters, sir... I haven't been able to find anything that would explain Bok's appearance.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Understood.
 WORF / (with surprise) Captain, I am detecting an object five thousand kilometers off our starboard bow -- it is another probe.
 PICARD / Why didn't we detect it before?
 WORF / It must have been cloaked, sir -- it appeared out of nowhere.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / (continuing) Another holographic device?
 DATA / I do not believe so, sir.
 WORF / (urgent) Captain, the probe's systems are overloading.
 RIKER / Red alert. Shields up!
 RIKER / (to Worf) Damage report.
 WORF / No damage, sir.
 DATA / Captain, I do not believe it was meant as an attack, but rather as a message.
 PICARD / A message?
 DATA / In B'Zal, a Ferengi code which uses an alternating pattern of light and darkness.
 PICARD / Can you translate it?
 DATA / I am attempting to do so... (works) The message appears to read: "My revenge is at hand."
 PICARD / He's proved he can get to us whenever he wants. What's he waiting for?
 PICARD / Tea, earl grey -- hot.
 BOK / If you want me to stay and talk you'd better not call for security this time...
 BOK / How do you like your boy, Captain? Is he everything you'd always hoped for?
 PICARD / It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'll be ready for you. Why don't we settle this now?
 BOK / How do you propose to do that, Picard? You murdered my son.
 PICARD / It was self-defense. He fired on my ship.
 BOK / You were in Ferengi space!
 PICARD / I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. (beat) I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back.
 BOK / How touching. But your apology is worthless to me. And I demand that you repay me for my loss.
 PICARD / (firm) You can't put a price on a life.
 BOK / Oh, but you can, Picard. You can pay me with your son's life.
 PICARD / No...
 BOK / I'm afraid you don't have any choice. I insist on being paid...
 BEVERLY / That should do it, but let's run a level-three bio-scan just to be sure.
 BEVERLY / Have you ever had a seizure like this before?
 BEVERLY / When did it first start to happen?
 BEVERLY / You have a condition called Forrester-Trent syndrome. It's a degenerative neurological disorder -- very rare.
 PICARD / What do you mean degenerative?
 BEVERLY / If it goes untreated, it can lead to paralysis... even death. I'm starting you on a neuro-stabilization regimen. If we're lucky, we should be able to halt the degeneration, maybe even reverse it.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) The disease is hereditary. (glances at Picard) I know your father doesn't have it... was your mother prone to seizures?
 BEVERLY / There have been a few reported cases where the disease was instigated by random mutation... (to Picard) I'll run a micro-cellular scan to see if that's what happened.
 BEVERLY / (continuing, to Jason) In the meantime, I want you to take it easy, get some rest.
 PICARD / Is he going to be all right... ?
 BEVERLY / I wish I could say for certain. There's no way to know how he'll respond to the treatment.
 PICARD / Is there any... facility we can take him to -- where they might have special expertise?
 BEVERLY / I'm afraid there isn't. But I'll do everything I can.
 PICARD / I know you will... I'm sorry. It's just hard for me to accept that there's nothing I can do...
 BEVERLY / I understand...
 PICARD / I've been thinking about what you said the other day. You were right, you know. I convinced myself Jason didn't want me to reach out to him... (beat) Because I don't have the faintest idea how to do it.
 BEVERLY / I don't think anyone is born knowing how to be a parent. You kind of figure it out as you go.
 PICARD / But nothing I try seems to work.
 BEVERLY / (a small smile) I think anyone who's had a child can relate to that. (beat) If there's one quality parenthood tends to require -- it's patience.
 PICARD / I'm just not sure that's going to be enough in his case. (beat) I found out he has a criminal record. Nothing terribly serious -- petty theft, that sort of thing -- but... he's a grown man. Is it too late for him to turn around?
 BEVERLY / That's really up to him.
 BEVERLY / Maybe. But you can't blame yourself for not having been there. All you can do is be there for him now.
 PICARD / And be patient.
 BEVERLY / And be patient.
 GEORDI / I think we've found something...
 DATA / Bok was in direct contact with this chair for an extended period... it is showing a distinctive subspace signature as a result.
 GEORDI / We think he's using some sort of... subspace transporter to beam aboard the Enterprise.
 PICARD / My understanding is that such devices were impractical.
 DATA / The Federation abandoned its research in the field because the technology was found to be unreliable... as well as extremely energy intensive.
 GEORDI / In order to transport matter through subspace, you have to put it into a state of quantum flux -- it's very unstable.
 DATA / The quantum effect would explain why our sensors did not detect Bok's presence.
 GEORDI / It would also explain why he was able to penetrate our shields.
 PICARD / What range would this kind of transporter have?
 DATA / In theory it could operate over several light years.
 GEORDI / That means the probe that exploded could have been beamed into position from some point outside sensor range.
 DATA / If Bok uses his transporter again, we may be able to trace the subspace signature and locate his ship.
 PICARD / Is there any way to keep him from beaming aboard the Enterprise again?
 GEORDI / I don't think there is...
 PICARD / If he has the ability to beam aboard, he might be able to beam someone away.
 DATA / It is a possibility.
 PICARD / I'm concerned that he's going to try to take Daniel -- is there any way we can protect him?
 GEORDI / We could keep a signal lock on him at all times... if Bok tried to beam him away, we might be able to keep him from getting a pattern lock.
 DATA / In order to do so, we would have to tie the ship's subspace field coils into the transporter system.
 PICARD / Make it so.
 PICARD / Open.
 PICARD / Would you mind waiting outside?
 PICARD / I like climbing. There's something about... literally having your fate in your own hands.
 PICARD / I came to tell you that we may have found a way to locate Bok's ship... this might be over soon.
 PICARD / I thought it might make you feel better.
 PICARD / Jason... after your mother and I parted... I lost track of her completely. (beat) I'd like to know more about what happened to her... if you don't mind telling me.
 PICARD / Well... why did you go to Camor? It seems an unlikely place for a woman and a child...
 PICARD / (smiling) That was Miranda, all right.
 PICARD / (understanding) I see...
 PICARD / I'm sorry...
 PICARD / Jason... isn't there some way I can be a father to you?
 PICARD / My father and I were estranged... he thought I should stay home and tend the vineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. He died before we could come to terms about it... and I've regretted that all my life. (beat) I don't want the same thing to happen to us.
 PICARD / That's not so...
 PICARD / (beat) I know.
 PICARD / I'm aware of your trouble with the Camor authorities.
 PICARD / It doesn't change anything. You're still my son. And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, but I know it means something. That we're... connected...
 PICARD / At the very least... (smiles) -- I know you'll never look at your hairline the same way again.
 PICARD / Come on -- let's get to the top of this thing...
 PICARD / You wanted to see me?
 BEVERLY / It's about Jason...
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I finished the micro-cellular scan I was running... there's something you need to know...
 DATA / (off console) Sir... sensors detect a subspace carrier wave heading toward the ship... (works) -- its signature is consistent with Bok's transporter.
 RIKER / Can you tell what part of the ship it's headed toward?
 DATA / (works) Not yet, Commander.
 RIKER / (to Worf) See if you can track the signature and locate Bok's ship. (to Com) Geordi, are you ready down there?
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / I've got a signal lock on Jason.
 RIKER / Riker to Captain --
 PICARD / Picard, here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Bok is trying to use his transporter.
 DATA / (off console) The transporter beam is focusing on deck nine, section four.
 RIKER / Jason's quarters...
 GEORDI / I'm on it, Commander.
 GEORDI / Initiating transport, now --
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm losing his signal...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Bok's re-establishing his lock...
 PICARD / Have you been able to locate Bok's ship?
 DATA / (as he works) No, sir. The subspace signature left by his transporter is decaying more rapidly than predicted -- it may not be possible to trace it.
 WORF / (urgent) Sir, another probe has materialized five hundred kilometers to starboard... (off console) -- it is sending a transmission.
 PICARD / On screen.
 BOK / This is a very special day, Picard. Fifteen years ago you took my son away from me... today, I will take yours away from you. It will be... our anniversary.
 BOK / I wanted you to see him one last time... so you could cherish his memory forever...
 DATA / I have traced the transporter beam Bok used to send the probe -- His ship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometers from here...
 PICARD / Plot a course -- maximum warp.
 RIKER / (quiet) Even at warp nine we won't get there for almost twenty minutes...
 PICARD / (to Data) The modifications you made to our Transporter... is there any way you could try a subspace transport from here and get me aboard Bok's ship?
 DATA / It may be possible, but it would not be advisable.
 PICARD / (to Data) You're with me.
 BOK / You're lying. Picard would never reject his own son.
 BOK / You are a clever young man. But I do not believe that Picard will be unaffected by your death.
 BOK / He will... Picard won't know the boy is dead until it's too late...
 GEORDI / There... I've aligned the field coils...
 DATA / The phase dampers are in synch... standing by to modulate the transport pattern...
 GEORDI / Sir, we might be able to get you over there, but I don't see how we're going to get you back.
 PICARD / We'll deal with that when the time comes.
 GEORDI / The transport is going to take longer than normal... we're going to have to shunt your pattern through the subspace field coils...
 PICARD / Understood...
 DATA / Initiating transport sequence... now...
 BOK / What kind of deal?
 BOK / I understand your desire to live. But I want Picard to see your body -- so there will be no doubt.
 PICARD / Lower your weapons or Bok is dead...
 BOK / Lower yours... or your son dies.
 PICARD / You know as well as I do, Bok... he's not my son.
 PICARD / I know what you did... Miranda Vigo is Jason's mother... but, I am not his father... it only appeared as if I were because you resequenced his DNA...
 PICARD / But your technique was flawed... Jason began to suffer from a neurological disorder... when my ship's Doctor investigated its cause, she discovered what you'd done...
 PICARD / There was never going to be any ransom. All Bok has ever cared about was vengeance.
 PICARD / He is no longer a Daimon -- he was stripped of command.
 BOK / They had no right to do that to me.
 PICARD / He lied to you so you'd help him carry out his plan.
 PICARD / (continuing) The Enterprise is closing in on your position... if you let us both go now, you won't be attacked.
 BOK / Your crew won't attack -- not while you're on board.
 PICARD / They'll cripple your vessel and keep you here until the Ferengi authorities arrive.
 PICARD / (continuing) You'll have a great deal of explaining to do... your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that he deceived you.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47831.8. At Jason's request, the Enterprise has returned to Camor Five.
 PICARD / I'm glad to hear it...
 PICARD / Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay aboard the Enterprise for a few more days?
 PICARD / I understand...
 PICARD / I will...
 PICARD / I slipped a little something into your bag while you were packing...
 PICARD / (continuing, smiles) I know you'd prefer a bottle of Saurian brandy... but this is all I could come up with.
 PICARD / I want you to have it...
 PICARD / Energize...
 DATA / "I have bedimm'd the noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds, and 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak with his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up the pine and cedar; graves at my command have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth by my so potent art."
 DATA / (continuing) "But this rough magic I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd some Heavenly music -- which even now I do -- to work mine end upon their senses, that this airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, bury it certain fadoms in the earth, and deeper than did ever plummet sound -- I'll drown my book."
 DATA / (continuing) Captain, your attention is... wandering.
 PICARD / I can barely see.
 DATA / Sir, I am supposed to be attempting a Neo-Platonic magical rite -- the darkness is appropriate to such a ritual.
 (CONTINUED) PICARD / This is a play, Data. The audience has to see you.
 DATA / Perhaps I have been too... literal with respect to my set design. (to computer) Computer. Modify Holodeck program Data seven-three, Shakespeare's The Tempest, Act Five, scene one. Increase torchlight by twenty-percent.
 PICARD / Much better. (beat) Would you like to try it again?
 DATA / Yes, sir... but I am not certain I fully understand the character of Prospero. I would appreciate any insights you may have which would improve my performance.
 PICARD / Well... Shakespeare witnessed the end of the Renaissance and the birth of the modern era. Prospero found himself in a world which no longer had any use for his powers...
 PICARD / (continuing) Here he is about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art forever.
 DATA / There is certainly a tragic aspect to the character.
 PICARD / Yes, but he had a certain... expectancy as well. A hopefulness about the future...
 PICARD / (continuing) Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites...
 PICARD / (continuing) Past and future... Despair and hope...
 PICARD / (continuing) Data, is this part of your program?
 DATA / No, Sir.
 PICARD / Then what is it?
 DATA / It appears to be a steam locomotive.
 PICARD / A train?
 DATA / (nods) If I am not mistaken.
 PICARD / Computer, end program.
 PICARD / (continuing, louder) Computer, end program...
 DATA / (concerned) Captain, you are injured...
 PICARD / It's just a scrape... I'll have it seen to...
 DATA / The train we encountered is from one of Doctor Crusher's Holodeck programs. It is a re-creation of the Orient Express, a train which ran from Paris to Istanbul from the late nineteenth century until --
 PICARD / Yes, yes, I know about the Orient Express... but what was it doing on Prospero's Island?
 DATA / There appears to have been a malfunction in the Holodeck's database retrieval system. The two programs were somehow temporarily linked together.
 PICARD / Could this malfunction affect the other Holodecks as well?
 DATA / It is a possibility. I would have to run a diagnostic to be certain.
 PICARD / All right, get to it. And shut down all of the Holodecks until you're finished, just to be on the safe side.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / I never realized you were interested in trains. Did you know that at its peak, the Orient Express carried over ten thousand passengers a year?
 BEVERLY / It's not really the train itself I'm interested in...
 PICARD / Then what?
 BEVERLY / The experience. (beat) The Orient Express was... mystery and romance. It was an elegant way to see exotic places and meet fascinating people... (beat) Did you know that on one trip, both Sigmund Freud and Gertrude Stein just happened to be on the same car? They ended up having dinner together every night.
 PICARD / I wonder what they talked about... ?
 BEVERLY / Why don't you take a trip yourself... and find out?
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / Riker to Picard.
 PICARD / (taps combadge) Picard here.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / All sections are ready to begin the survey, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) Very good. I'm on my way.
 BEVERLY / Think about that trip, Jean-Luc... You never know who you'll meet on the Orient Express...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47869.2. After weathering an unexpected magnascopic storm in the Mekorda Sector, we are continuing our search for new Federation colony sites.
 RIKER / I don't see any possibility of developing sites in this region. Most of the stars are mainsequence binaries with no M-class planets.
 PICARD / (reads PADD) All right then, let's move on to the next survey region... Have stellar cartography begin a--
 PICARD / Mister Data, report.
 DATA / (off console) The ship has gone into warp, sir.
 RIKER / Who gave the command?
 DATA / (off console) Apparently no one. Helm and navigation controls are not functioning. (beat) Our speed is now warp seven-point-three and holding.
 PICARD / (to com) Picard to Engineering. Mister La Forge, what's going on down there?
 GEORDI is frantically moving between consoles. / 
 GEORDI / (to com) I don't understand it, sir. The impulse systems suddenly cut out and the warp drive kicked in.
 RIKER / Geordi, can you take the engines off-line?
 GEORDI / I'm working on it...
 PICARD / Data, what's our heading?
 DATA / (off console) Bearing one-eight-seven mark four. I am unable to determine our destination -- but we are heading away from the Mekorda sector.
 GEORDI / (breaking in) Captain, the computer's locked-out all the propulsion controls... I can't access any of the overrides... (beat) If you want us to stop, we'll have to do an emergency core shutdown...
 RIKER / (to Picard) That'll leave us without warp power for more than a week...
 PICARD / Begin the procedure, Mister La Forge...
 DATA / (off console) We are no longer at warp... Impulse power has resumed... all systems show normal.
 RIKER / Where are we?
 DATA / (off console) We are approximately thirty-billion kilometers from our original position.
 PICARD / (to com) Good work, Geordi.
 GEORDI / It wasn't me that took us out of warp, sir. I didn't have time to complete the shut-down procedure...
 PICARD / (to com) Well, I want an explanation. Picard out.
 PICARD / Have you found anything, yet?
 GEORDI / Only that we've got more than one mystery here, sir...
 GEORDI / (continuing) We still don't know why the ship jumped into warp... but it looks like we're lucky it did.
 GEORDI / (continuing) There was a theta flux distortion building up around the ship.
 PICARD / (concerned) Why didn't the sensors alert us?
 GEORDI / Our sensors were never designed to detect theta flux distortions. And yet -- there is a record of the distortion in the sensor log. That's the other mystery.
 DATA / One fact is clear, however. The distortion was gaining in strength. If we had remained at our original position one-point seven seconds longer, the distortion would have ruptured our warp core.
 GEORDI / If the Enterprise hadn't jumped into warp when it did... we would've been blown to pieces.
 GEORDI / I just don't get it, Data. What could have caused the engines to jump into warp drive on their own?
 DATA / Perhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation.
 GEORDI / (skeptical) Which occurred just in time to save the ship?
 DATA / It is improbable... but it is possible.
 GEORDI / Well, I don't think I'm ready to start believing in luck.
 DATA / There is another possibility. The sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly that threatened the Enterprise. It is possible that they triggered a safety response which caused the ship to avoid destruction.
 GEORDI / But there's no direct link between the sensors and the warp engines...
 GEORDI / What is this... ?
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) It's some kind of new circuit node... and it's connected to at least half a dozen points in the sensor array...
 DATA / (off tricorder) It appears to be connected to several other systems as well... including the warp control circuits.
 GEORDI / I guess there is a link between the sensors and the engines after all..
 GEORDI / A force field... where did that come from?
 DATA / I am not certain -- possibly from the node itself.
 GEORDI / Well... wherever it came from... it sure doesn't want us messing with that node.
 DATA / It appears to be protecting itself.
 GEORDI / (re: graphic) We found these "nodes" in several systems around the ship. At some level, they were all connected to each other.
 DATA / There were nodes linking the sensors to our warp control and defensive systems. We believe this is why the ship jumped to warp.
 GEORDI / When the sensors detected danger, the defensive systems reacted to the threat -- and activated the warp engines to protect us.
 RIKER / Where did these nodes come from?
 DATA / It is possible that the magnascopic storm we recently experienced had an unexpected effect on the ship's systems.
 GEORDI / Wherever they came from, they seem to be multiplying.
 DATA / As they increase, it will become progressively more difficult to control the ship.
 RIKER / What do you propose we do?
 GEORDI / Well, it's not going to be easy to get rid of them. (beat) When we attempted to examine the circuitry of one of the nodes, it generated a force-field to keep us out.
 RIKER / Whatever's going on here -- our first priority is to get back control of the ship.
 DATA / Agreed...
 DATA / (continuing) All of the nodes intersect in Holodeck three. It appears to be a... focal point of some kind.
 GEORDI / We might be able to find a way to use the Holodeck circuits to disable the nodes...
 RIKER / All right. Let's do it.
 DATA / (puzzled) Commander, the Holodeck appears to be in operation.
 RIKER / I thought you shut down the entire system.
 DATA / I did. However, it has reactivated itself... and it will not disengage.
 WORF / Which program is running?
 DATA / (off panel) Several different programs appear to be running simultaneously.
 RIKER / Well... this should be interesting...
 RIKER / (a bit overwhelmed) You weren't kidding, Data...
 DATA / (off tricorder) No, sir. I estimate that this... scene consists of portions of at least seven distinct Holodeck programs...
 RIKER / See if you can access the circuits that have been affected by the nodes.
 DATA (O.S.) / Commander...
 DATA / (continuing) We have located a large concentration of nodes behind this wall... They appear to be connected directly to the Holodeck's main power coupling.
 RIKER / All right... go ahead and depolarize the entire power grid.
 RIKER / We... left them in our compartments. (to Worf) I told you to bring the tickets.
 WORF / I... forgot.
 GEORDI / I'm all right...
 GEORDI / (continuing, disbelief) It looks like the navigational relays overloaded...
 DATA / I believe we have changed direction...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to La Forge. What's going on? We just went into warp...
 GEORDI / (off console) We've lost engine and helm control again, sir... but this time, they're completely burned out. (beat, grim) I don't know if we can stop the ship.
 DATA / (quietly) According to my tricorder, the Holodeck safeties have been disengaged. His weapon could be lethal.
 RIKER / All right... let's get out of here.
 DATA / The number of systems now affected by the nodes has grown considerably. (beat) Sensors, engines, replicators, propulsion... they are all working together now, almost independently of the main computer. And the nodes link all of them through the Holodeck.
 RIKER / But why the Holodeck? That doesn't make any sense.
 DATA / Commander, I think what happens on the Holodeck has a direct effect on the ship. When we attempted to destroy the nodes -- the characters on the train responded immediately to stop us.
 RIKER / And when the Engineer tried to protect us -- one of the characters shot him.
 DATA / The Conductor then signalled for the train to change directions... and at approximately the same time --
 GEORDI / -- the Enterprise took off in a new direction, too.
 RIKER / Are you saying... that the ship is being controlled by the Holodeck?
 DATA / Not precisely.
 DATA / Geordi, does the configuration of the connection nodes look familiar to you?
 GEORDI / (realizing) Yeah... it's... a little like the structure of your positronic brain.
 DATA / That is correct. It appears that the nodes are in the process of creating a rudimentary neural net.
 RIKER / Data -- what are you suggesting?
 DATA / Unlikely as it may sound... I believe that the Enterprise may be forming an intelligence.
 DATA / This is a synaptic map of the human neo-cortex... (indicates second image) This is a cross-section of my positronic net... (indicates third image) And this is a schematic of the connection nodes linking the ship's systems...
 DATA / (continuing) I believe some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship. It is still relatively primitive, but it is an intelligence nonetheless.
 TROI / How could this happen?
 DATA / I believe it is an emergent property.
 PICARD / Explain.
 DATA / Complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely unpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described in terms of cellular functions and neuro-chemical interactions.
 DATA / But that description does not explain human consciousness -- a capacity that far exceeds simple neural functions. (beat) Consciousness is an emergent property.
 GEORDI / In other words, something that's more than the sum of its parts...
 DATA / Exactly.
 BEVERLY / How does that explain what's happening to the Enterprise?
 DATA / The Enterprise contains a vast database of information which is managed by a sophisticated computer. This complex system gives the ship many of the characteristics of a biological organism.
 RIKER / That's true... it "sees" with its sensors... "talks" with its communications systems...
 BEVERLY / In a sense, it even "reproduces" with the replicators...
 PICARD / (to Data) And you think the ship has somehow gone beyond those functions... has developed a new capacity...
 DATA / Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining intelligence is emerging.
 WORF / If that is so... what does the ship want? Where is it taking us?
 DATA / I believe the key to understanding the ship's behavior lies in the Holodeck. (beat) All of the connection nodes intersect at that location. It is clearly some kind of processing center.
 PICARD / Processing center... ?
 DATA / Yes, sir. A focal point... where all the ideas and instincts of this emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form.
 TROI / Almost like an "imagination... "
 TROI / (continuing) Sir, I'd like to go to the Holodeck. I could interact with the characters... maybe find some clues that would help us understand what's happening.
 PICARD / Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, you'll go along. See if there's any way to re-establish control of the ship without destroying the nodes. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) If this ship truly is an emerging intelligence, then it's our responsibility to treat it with the same respect we would give any other being.
 WORF / Welcome aboard, Counselor...
 DATA / If you will distract these people, I will attempt to depolarize the power grid.
 WORF / Have you finished the puzzle yet?
 WORF / Do you recognize it?
 TROI / No...
 WORF / (to the puzzlers) I'd like to help.
 WORF / Tell me... exactly what are you making?
 WORF / No, I mean the picture. What is it?
 TROI / Can you deal me in?
 TROI / Is that why you killed the Engineer -- to get this brick?
 TROI / Why? What's at Keystone City?
 WORF / Are you succeeding, Commander?
 DATA / I am ready to access the main power grid.
 WORF / We do not want any trouble, sir. We are simply... passengers.
 TROI / Wait -- tell me what happens at Keystone City. Why are you taking the brick there... ?
 TROI / I think we should follow that man. That brick may be an important clue...
 TROI / (frustrated) Where did he go... ?
 DATA / I can access the power grid here.
 DATA / I will attempt to depolarize the grid by using a low-frequency inversion field. That may disengage the nodes without destroying them.
 TROI / There he is. I'm going after him.
 WORF / I am coming with you.
 TROI / What are you doing here?
 GEORDI / (off console) I don't understand it, sir... Cargo Bay Five suddenly started to depressurize...
 PICARD / Did everyone get out in time?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir, and I've re-established the containment field... But I'm reading massive power surges in the Cargo Bay, and all sorts of transporter activity... (beat) There's something weird happening, sir.
 PICARD / Get a team down there immediately. I want to know what's going on.
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 GEORDI / (taps combadge) La Forge to Bridge...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard here... what's going on?
 GEORDI / I wish I could tell you...
 TROI / That man said he was "laying a foundation"...
 WORF / But a foundation for what... ?
 TROI / (taps combadge) Troi to Data...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Data here.
 TROI / (to com) How are you coming?
 DATA / (to com) I encountered a minor difficulty, Counselor...
 DATA / (continuing, to com) But it has been dealt with. I am ready to depolarize the power grid.
 GEORDI / (to N.D., off tricorder) It looks like the ship's replicator and transporter systems have been merged somehow... they're working together to create this... the question is, what is it?
 GEORDI / (continuing, to N.D.) Ensign, I want to run a full spectral analysis on --
 GEORDI / (continuing) I'm picking up a massive power fluctuation... the ship's losing structural integrity...
 TROI / What's happening?
 WORF / An earthquake... ?
 WORF / (continuing) Deanna!
 GEORDI'S COM VOICE / La Forge to Data -- stop what you're doing!
 DATA / Acknowledged...
 GEORDI / Data... I think we should get together and compare notes.
 TROI / The ship was protecting itself again -- stopping us from interfering. Whatever it's doing -- it intends to continue.
 GEORDI / I'm betting it all has something to do with the object that's forming in the Cargo Bay.
 TROI / I think he's right, Captain. Look at the common themes that are playing out on the Holodeck. A puzzle being put together... a foundation being laid... a paper doll being fashioned. All images of something being constructed.
 GEORDI / And an object in the Cargo Bay that's being constructed -- atom by atom.
 PICARD / What is this object?
 GEORDI / I have no idea. It's composed of silica polymers, duranium, and a few other compounds we can't identify. (beat) But creating it has put quite a strain on our systems. Warp power has dropped forty-seven percent...
 PICARD / Counselor, were you able to draw any other conclusions from your experience on the Holodeck? Anything that might help us handle this situation?
 TROI / I think the Holodeck is what might be called the ship's "imagination." It's full of fanciful, metaphoric imagery -- as though it's having some kind of... daydream. It may not make literal sense... but symbolically there's probably some kind of logic to it.
 BEVERLY / The characters you spoke to... do they have any particular significance?
 TROI / I think they represent various aspects of the ship. The Engineer, for instance... may have represented the navigational system. The Gunslinger could be the weapon system...
 PICARD / Is there any possibility that we might be able to persuade them to give back control of the ship?
 TROI / I'm not sure it's possible to reason with them. Many of them seem genuinely unaware of what's going on... and of their role in it.
 TROI / It's as though this emergent intelligence is still an infant... acting on instinct, trying to figure itself out as it goes. The only source of experience it can draw on is ours -- through our Holodeck programs.
 PICARD / Is there a way to... relate to them on their own level... influence their behavior in some way... ?
 TROI / (considers) Maybe there is. (beat) I'd like to go back and try.
 BEVERLY / Deanna, the injuries you got on the Holodeck could have killed you...
 GEORDI / And so far, we haven't been able to re-establish the safeties.
 TROI / I'm aware of that.
 PICARD / Go ahead, Counselor. But keep this in mind... so far, we've tried to thwart the ship in all its efforts. And that's gotten us nowhere. (beat) Maybe it's time to try cooperating.
 WORF / Three for Vertiform City.
 WORF / What was that?
 TROI / Is there anything we could do to help?
 TROI / Why don't you go with him, Worf... We'll do what we can here.
 TROI / Of course we are. Don't worry about a thing. (beat) Now... I want you to tell me everything you know about Vertiform City.
 RIKER / (off console) I don't know how or why, sir... but power's almost back to normal levels... life support systems coming on line on all decks.
 PICARD / What's our heading?
 RIKER / It looks like we're on course for... Tambor Beta-six. It's a white dwarf star...
 RIKER / The ship is using a modified tractor beam to collect vertion particles from the star.
 PICARD / (to Picard) Vertion particles... "Vertiform" City. This is what the ship was looking for...
 RIKER / (off console) Sir, the particles are being routed through the transporter system -- and into Cargo Bay Five.
 PICARD / (to com) Geordi... what's going on?
 GEORDI / (off tricorder, to com) The object's absorbing vertion particles, sir... and it's growing even faster than before. (beat; amazed) Sir... I'm picking up internal energy emissions from this thing...
 RIKER / What do you mean?
 GEORDI / It's beginning to generate its own energy...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Can you be more specific?
 GEORDI / I'm picking up coherent emissions... matter conversion... it's incredible...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Wait, something's wrong... we've got power fluctuations... the vertion absorption rate is dropping... (beat) What's happening to the particle beam?
 RIKER / The beam's exhausted the supply of particles in the star... there's nothing left to take out.
 GEORDI / Captain -- the object's energy output is decreasing...
 WORF / What is it... ?
 WORF / Are you all right?
 TROI / Yes... what happened?
 WORF / The Conductor accidently derailed the train.
 DATA / (taps combadge) Data to Captain Picard...
 PICARD / (to Com) Picard here.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / We have had an accident in the Holodeck. Has anything happened to the Enterprise?
 PICARD / Yes -- a ship-wide shutdown. We've lost attitude control and most systems are off-line.
 GEORDI (O.S.) / Captain, I think you better take a look at this...
 GEORDI / (continuing) When the particle beam cut off, the object was beginning to form a coherent energy matrix...
 GEORDI / (continuing) ... and if these readings are accurate, I'd say the emission patterns were almost... organic.
 PICARD / Are you suggesting that the Enterprise has been attempting to create... a lifeform?
 GEORDI / I think so...
 PICARD / Will it... survive?
 GEORDI / (off tricorder) Its energy levels are dropping rapidly... Unless it gets an infusion of vertion particles pretty soon... I don't think so.
 GEORDI / Captain, our systems are back on line... we're moving again -- at warp nine.
 PICARD / Let's get back to the Bridge.
 TROI / Where are we going now?
 DATA / (taps combadge) Data to Captain...
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard here.
 DATA / (to com) The train has returned to normal, sir...
 DATA'S COM VOICE / (continuing) ... and our destination is "New Vertiform City."
 PICARD / (to Riker) What's our course?
 RIKER / (checks his console) We're heading for the Cordannas system.
 PICARD / Another white dwarf star?
 RIKER / Yes. It's the closest one to our last position...
 GEORDI / Captain, we've got a problem...
 GEORDI / (continuing) Even at warp nine, the Cordannas system is over twelve hours from here...
 PICARD / Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long?
 GEORDI / I think it will, sir, but that's not the problem... (beat) The ship's diverted all of our systems to maximize propulsion -- including life support. (beat) We've got less than two hours of reserve oxygen.
 PICARD / (to com) Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means you have to get control of that train.
 DATA'S COM VOICE / Understood, sir.
 PICARD / (to Geordi) The ship is looking for vertion particles... and it believes that the Cordannas system is the closest source... (beat) Is there another source -- something closer?
 GEORDI / White dwarf stars are the only natural source, sir.
 PICARD / Then what about artificial sources? Is there any way to create them?
 DATA / How did the Conductor stop the train?
 WORF / There is a braking lever in the engine room.
 TROI / Let's go...
 GEORDI / I've narrowed the search to the MacPherson Nebula, which is a supernova remnant... or Dikonalpha, a class-nine pulsar...
 GEORDI / (continuing) They're both fairly close to our current flight path... and either one might produce vertion particles if we detonated a modified photon torpedo inside it.
 RIKER / Vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts. Do you think either of these phenomena can produce enough of them?
 GEORDI / That's hard to say. I can't even guarantee that we can create them at all.
 PICARD / Well, we have to give it a try. The nebula or the pulsar? It's your choice, Mister La Forge.
 GEORDI / I think we should go for the nebula.
 PICARD / Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications.
 RIKER / (to Picard) Now let's hope we can get the ship to go where we want it to.
 TROI / Please listen to me. We understand what's happening. We know you must get to New Vertiform City. (beat) And we want to help you get there.
 TROI / Please. We're your friends.
 TROI / Yes. I promise.
 DATA / I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route.
 DATA / Yes. If you will let me handle the controls.
 DATA / (to com) Data to Captain Picard...
 DATA / (continuing) I have taken control of the engine room.
 PICARD / Stand by. (to Geordi) Are we within sensor range of the nebula?
 GEORDI / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) Mister Data, try to slow us to impulse speed.
 DATA / I will attempt to do so.
 PICARD / Are the torpedo modifications complete?
 GEORDI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Launch torpedo.
 GEORDI / (off console) It's working, sir... the reaction's producing vertion particles...
 RIKER / The nodes are deactivating all over the ship. Our systems are beginning to function normally again.
 PICARD / Then the purpose of the ship's intelligence... was simply to bring that life form into being...
 BEVERLY / There are entire species whose sole purpose in life is to reproduce. And when they finally procreate... they die.
 GEORDI / Captain, look...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. The Enterprise is back under our control. All traces of the emergent intelligence are gone... and the object it created has disappeared into space...
 PICARD / Come.
 DATA / Captain, I am staging a scene from The Tempest this evening for a small audience. I would like you to attend.
 PICARD / I'd be honored. Which scene?
 DATA / Miranda's first encounter with other human beings.
 PICARD / (smiles) "Oh brave new world that has such people in it."
 DATA / It seemed appropriate.
 DATA / Captain. You took a significant risk in allowing the Enterprise to complete its... task.
 PICARD / Why do you say that?
 DATA / Because the end product was unknown. The object could have been dangerous. It may in fact, be dangerous...
 PICARD / And I've allowed it to go off on its merry way.
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / The intelligence that formed on the Enterprise... it didn't just come out of the ship's systems -- it came out of us. Our mission records, our personal logs, even our Holodeck programs -- our fantasies.
 PICARD / (continuing) If our experiences with the Enterprise have been honorable...
 PICARD / (continuing) Then can't we trust the sum of those experiences to be the same?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47941.7. The Enterprise is en route to a briefing on the situation in the Demilitarized Zone along the Cardassian border. Meanwhile, we are celebrating the return of an old friend.
 BEVERLY / Welcome home.
 TROI / Congratulations on your promotion -- Lieutenant.
 TROI / Thank you.
 GEORDI / (teasing) I hear Advanced Tactical Training is a real picnic...
 BEVERLY / Did you see the buffet?
 TROI / Yes, that's real Bajoran foraiga.
 GEORDI / It wasn't easy to find.
 TROI / Where are your new quarters?
 BEVERLY / What do you plan to --
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Picard to Lieutenant Ro.
 PICARD'S COM VOICE / Please report to the Bridge.
 PICARD / You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention... I thought you could use a break.
 PICARD / You're looking fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training must have agreed with you.
 PICARD / That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes out every year. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (beat) Somehow I knew you wouldn't be one of those.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / (urgent) Bridge to Captain --
 PICARD / (hits combadge) Go ahead.
 RIKER / We're receiving a distress signal from a Cardassian ship near the Demilitarized Zone.
 PICARD / Change course to intercept -- I'm on my way. (to Ro) I'd like you at the Conn, Lieutenant.
 PICARD / Report.
 RIKER / The Cardassian ship relayed a distress signal but it was cut off before they could tell us what was wrong.
 PICARD / Can you identify them?
 DATA / I will scan their warp signatures.
 DATA / Sir, sensors indicate that the attacking vessels are Federation ships.
 PICARD / On screen.
 RIKER / Those are Federation ships.
 PICARD / Isolate one and magnify.
 PICARD / (continuing) The Maquis... (beat, grim) Open a channel.
 PICARD / To all Maquis ships -- call off your attack or we will be forced to engage you.
 WORF / No response.
 PICARD / You are Federation citizens. Your actions are in violation of our treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack.
 PICARD / Are we in firing range?
 WORF / Not yet, sir.
 PICARD / Arm phasers and photon torpedoes and stand by.
 RIKER / I never thought we'd be firing on our own people to protect a Cardassian ship...
 DATA / The Maquis ships are regrouping... they are closing in on the Cardassian vessel.
 WORF / (off console) The Cardassian's shields are down to thirty percent.
 RIKER / They may not be able to withstand another hit.
 WORF / Sir, we are within weapons range.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, can you detonate a torpedo spread between the Maquis ships and the Cardassians?
 WORF / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Do it.
 WORF / The Maquis are breaking formation -- they are withdrawing.
 PICARD / Signal the Cardassians that we're standing by to assist them if they have any wounded.
 BEVERLY / Yes. Now please, sit still.
 PICARD / Gul Evek. I'm sorry we weren't able to come to your aid sooner.
 PICARD / I assure you that's not the case. We're doing everything we can to control them.
 PICARD / It was certainly not through official channels.
 PICARD / Starfleet does not condone the Maquis' actions in the Demilitarized Zone. (beat) Any more than your government condones paramilitary actions by Cardassian civilians.
 PICARD / Considering that they destroyed a Juhryan freighter less than a week ago, I'd say your efforts have met with limited success.
 PICARD / What you're proposing would only perpetuate the cycle of violence.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. Gul Evek and his crew have left the Enterprise, and we have proceeded to our rendezvous with Admiral Nechayev.
 PICARD / Twice seemed to be pushing it a little...
 PICARD / You missed Gul Evek by a matter of hours. I asked him to stay -- I thought perhaps an admiral's assurances would convince him that we are trying to deal with the Maquis situation.
 PICARD / (for what it's worth) Gul Evek assures me that practice has stopped.
 PICARD / Admiral... this Maquis situation has you worried...
 PICARD / Frankly, I can understand why our colonists have taken up arms -- Starfleet isn't there to protect them anymore.
 PICARD / Perhaps you need an undercover operative.
 PICARD / Because of your recent training... because you're Bajoran... and because of your past troubles with Starfleet -- you'll have a certain credibility.
 PICARD / Immediately.
 PICARD / This is a rare case where our interests coincide with theirs -- we both want peace in the Demilitarized Zone.
 PICARD / We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant. Our civilian population in the Demilitarized Zone is in a difficult situation. (beat) But sympathy ends at a certain point. The peace treaty isn't just a piece of paper. If the Maquis force us into a war with Cardassia, it could mean hundreds of thousands of lives.
 PICARD / Laren, two years ago, Starfleet would never have tapped you for this mission. They must have a lot of confidence in you now.
 WORF / We are looking for a Bajoran woman, dark hair.
 DATA / She is responsible for the death of a Cardassian soldier.
 WORF / If we learn that she has been here, this establishment will be closed down.
 WORF / Yes.
 DATA / Do you know where she went?
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, Stardate 47943.2. It has been over a week since Lieutenant Ro left the Enterprise... we have yet to receive any communication from her.
 RIKER / We picked up a request for emergency assistance from a Federation science ship in the Topin system.
 PICARD / Are there any other ships in the vicinity?
 RIKER / We're the closest.
 PICARD / Helm, set course for the Topin system. (to Data) Signal the science ship that we're on our way.
 DATA / It is unlikely that they would receive our communication. The Topin system contains an unstable binary-star. It generates significant subspace interference.
 PICARD / Will we be able to use our sensors to find them?
 DATA / Most of our sensor systems will be ineffective, although our directional array may be able to cut through the interference.
 RIKER / But that array has such a narrow scan field... (with grim irony) -- we might as well break out the palm-beacons and try to find them that way...
 RIKER / Anything?
 DATA / (off console) No, sir. It will take approximately six hours to scan this system.
 WORF / (urgent) Sir -- the distress call is being repeated.
 PICARD / (to Data) Can you locate the signal?
 DATA / (working) I am attempting to do so.
 DATA / Sir, I am scanning the area from which the distress signal was sent... but I am unable to detect a vessel.
 WORF / Captain -- the computer has detected a piggyback communication on the last distress signal...
 PICARD / Can you decode it?
 WORF / It will take a few moments.
 PICARD / Do it.
 WORF / The message is difficult to decode... the interference has garbled much of the transmission. But it seems to be from Lieutenant Ro.
 PICARD / Ro... is on that ship... ?
 DATA / (off console) Sir, a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aft shields.
 PICARD / Let it through.
 WORF / (off console) Captain, a quantity of medical supplies was beamed out of Cargo Bay Seven.
 DATA / (off console) The vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design as the ships used by the Maquis. (beat) It is moving off...
 PICARD / Let it go. (beat) There must be someone with her... We should make it look like we're trying to stop them. (to Worf) Lock phasers on their previous position and fire.
 RIKER / (wry) Now we know what they mean by Advanced Tactical Training...
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. Having earned the Maquis' trust with her raid on the Enterprise, Lieutenant Ro has been given access to a ship and allowed to leave the settlement by herself.
 PICARD / Frankly, I find it hard to believe. Every ship going into the Demilitarized Zone is being searched.
 PICARD / We might be able to use that...
 PICARD / We've come up with a plan that has the potential to seriously curtail the Maquis.
 PICARD / (continuing) We want to give them a target so threatening -- that they'd be willing to commit as many people and ships as possible to destroy it.
 PICARD / Bio-genic weapons, for example. You could provide the Maquis with intelligence that the Cardassians are in fact supplying their colonists with them.
 PICARD / You could tell them that in order to get past the check-points, the Cardassians are shipping the components for these weapons through third parties. We'll put together a convoy and send it toward the Demilitarized Zone.
 PICARD / We'll station our ships in the Hugora Nebula to avoid detection.
 PICARD / That's correct.
 PICARD / Our intention is to outnumber them so heavily that they'll have no choice but to surrender.
 PICARD / I hope you're wrong. Because if they don't, we'll have to try to disable their vessels... (beat) -- you know as well as I do that's not always possible.
 PICARD / (continuing) If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
 PICARD / I knew I could count on you...
 PICARD / What is it?
 RIKER / We just got a communication from Lieutenant Ro. Data's decoding it now.
 DATA / (to Picard) She is requesting that you meet with her.
 RIKER / Was that part of your plan?
 PICARD / No. Something must have gone wrong.
 PICARD / Ale.
 PICARD / I hope not.
 PICARD / I'd like that.
 PICARD / Why?
 PICARD / But there are only six ships. We could even cut down the number.
 PICARD / Every intelligence report I get from Starfleet suggests that the Maquis are eager to expand their strikes... are looking to escalate their activity... but you're telling me that's not true... ?
 PICARD / (softly) Laren... what's going on?
 PICARD / Yes.
 PICARD / What?
 PICARD / Laren, are you telling me you want to back out of this mission?
 PICARD / This has nothing to do with me -- it's about you. If you back out now, you'll be throwing away everything you've worked for.
 PICARD / And just prolong the inevitable? No. (beat) We're committed to this mission. My only question to you is -- can you carry out your orders?
 PICARD / (continuing) Lieutenant... I could put you before a board of inquiry for having lied to me about this operation. I could certainly have you court martialed if you sabotage it. (beat) But I don't want to have to threaten you to do this... I want you to make the decision.
 PICARD / I feel it necessary to have Commander Riker return with you. He can pose as a relative.
 PICARD / (continuing) To make sure nothing happens that might obstruct this mission.
 PICARD / (loudly) Sorry -- I don't have that kind of money.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. We have received word from Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the Maquis will be attacking the convoy as planned... our ships have taken up position in the Hugora Nebula to wait for them.
 DATA / I have established a relay-link with the sensor probe we left on the perimeter of the Nebula. (gestures) This is the convoy. We are expecting the Maquis attack force to cross the border from the Demilitarized Zone here.
 PICARD / As soon as they cross the border, we'll intercept them...
 WORF / In order to insure that the ship Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro are piloting does not come under fire, I have relayed its warp signature to the rest of our attack force.
 DATA / Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming into sensor range.
 PICARD / Go to red alert.
 RIKER / Starfleet can't make its move until we're out of the Demilitarized Zone. We're to break formation and take cover in the Nebula as soon as they appear.
 RIKER / We cross the border in thirty seconds...
 RIKER / What the --
 DATA / (off console) Sir, the vessel being piloted by Lieutenant Ro is firing a low-intensity particle beam into the Nebula...
 PICARD / What the hell is she doing?
 DATA / The polarizing effect created by the beam may make it possible for us to be detected.
 PICARD / Can you counter the effect?
 DATA / I will attempt to do so.
 DATA / Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking formation.
 PICARD / Have they crossed the border?
 DATA / No, sir. They are withdrawing...
 WORF / (off console) Sir, Lieutenant Ro's ship is not retreating with the others... (beat) It is heading toward us...
 PICARD / When she comes aboard... take her into custody...
 RIKER / You're going with them?
 RIKER / So long, Ro. Take care of yourself.
 RIKER / She seemed... very sure that she was making the right choice.
 RIKER / (continuing) I think her only real regret... was that she let you down.
 PICARD / She let us all down...
 RIKER / Here's my report...
 WORF and TROI ENTER from the Holodeck doors. They are / dressed in casual clothing -- it's late, and the mood is light and intimate. Troi is smiling, and even Worf is happy -- it's clear they had a great time, wherever they were.
 TROI / That was an incredible program.
 WORF / I am glad you approve. I have always found the Black Sea at night to be a most... stimulating experience.
 TROI / Worf, we were strolling barefoot along the beach while balalaika music played in the air... ocean breeze washing over us... stars in the sky... a full moon rising... and the most you can say is "stimulating"?
 WORF / (groping) It was... very stimulating.
 TROI / The truth is, I don't spend nearly enough time on the Holodeck. (MORE)
 TROI (Cont'd) / I should take my own advice and use it to relax. (beat) Next time, I'll choose the program. If you like the Black Sea, you're going to love Lake Cataria on Betazed.
 WORF / Deanna... perhaps before there is a "next time" we should discuss... Commander Riker.
 TROI / (playful) Why, is he coming along?
 WORF / (awkward) No... but I do not wish to... I mean, it would be unfortunate if he... if you and I are going to continue... I do not want to hurt his feelings...
 TROI / Worf... I think it's all right to concentrate on our feelings... yours... and mine.
 There is a beat as they look into each other's eyes... the sexual tension rises a notch... will they or won't they? Finally, Worf takes the plunge -- leans over to kiss her... she lifts her lips to his, but just before they can kiss, the nearby Turbolift doors OPEN and PICARD bursts out, wearing only his bathrobe -- / 
 PICARD / Counselor!
 PICARD / (urgent) What's today's date? The date?
 WORF / Stardate 47988.
 PICARD / (to himself) 47988...
 TROI / Captain, what's wrong?
 PICARD / I'm not sure... I don't know how... or why, but... (beat) I'm moving back and forth through time.
 PICARD / It was as though I had physically left the ship and gone to another time and place... I was in the past...
 TROI / Can you describe where you were... what it looked like?
 PICARD / It's all slipping away so fast... like waking up from a nightmare...
 PICARD / (continuing) It was years ago... before I took command of the Enterprise. I was talking with someone... I don't remember who... (beat, remembering) But then -- everything changed. I wasn't in the past any longer... I was an old man, in the future... I was doing something outside... what was it?
 PICARD / I'm sorry. It's gone. I can't remember...
 TROI / It's all right. Have you considered the possibility that this was just a dream?
 PICARD / It was more than a dream... the smells and the sounds... the way things felt to the touch... it was all so real...
 TROI / How long did you stay in each of these time periods? Did it seem like minutes... hours?
 PICARD / I'm not sure. (struggling to recall) At first... there was a moment of confusion, of disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. But that passed... and then I felt perfectly natural... as though I belonged in that time. But I can't remember how long I stayed there. (frustrated) I know this doesn't make much sense... it's a feeling more than a distinct memory.
 TROI / Maybe we can identify specific symbols. Can you remember anything you saw, an object, a building perhaps --
 GEORDI'S VOICE / (calls out) Captain Picard to the Bridge!
 GEORDI / (with humor) Sir, I think we have a problem with the warp core, or the phase inducers, or some other damn thing.
 PICARD / Geordi...
 GEORDI / Hello, Captain... or should I make that Ambassador?
 PICARD / (snorts) Hasn't been Ambassador for a while either.
 GEORDI / How about Mister Picard?
 PICARD / How about... Jean-Luc?
 GEORDI / (smiles) I don't know if I can get used to that.
 PICARD / Good Lord, Geordi. How long has it been?
 GEORDI / Oh... about nine years.
 PICARD / No, no... I mean, since you last called me Captain? When was the last time we were all together... on the Enterprise?
 GEORDI / Close to twenty-five years.
 PICARD / Twenty-five years... (looks him over) Time's been good to you.
 GEORDI / It's been a little too good to me in some places.
 GEORDI / (continuing) Can I give you a hand?
 PICARD / Oh... I'm just tying some vines.
 GEORDI / Looks like you've got leaf miners. Might want to use a bacillus spray. (off his look) My wife is quite a gardener. I've picked up a little bit of it.
 PICARD / How is Leah?
 GEORDI / Busy as ever. She's just been made director of the Daystrom Institute.
 PICARD / And the little ones... Bret and Alandra? And...
 GEORDI / And Sidney. Not so little any more. Bret's applying to Starfleet Academy next year.
 PICARD / So what brings you here?
 GEORDI / Oh... I just thought I'd drop by. I'd been thinking about the old days on the Enterprise... and I was in the neighborhood...
 PICARD / Don't give me that. You don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth just to... drop by.
 GEORDI / No.
 PICARD / So. You've heard.
 GEORDI / Well... Leah has a few friends at Starfleet medical... and word gets around.
 Picard snorts and turns his attention to the vines. Grumpily -- PICARD / I'm not an invalid, you know. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its course.
 GEORDI / I know. But when I heard I just... wanted to come by all the same.
 PICARD / (softer) Well... as long as you're here, you can help me carry in some of these tools.
 PICARD / (continuing) My cooking may not be up to Leah's standards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea.
 PICARD / (continuing) By the way, I read your last novel. Not bad. I thought the protagonist was written a bit flamboyantly, but that's just my --
 GEORDI / Captain, are you all right? Captain?
 TASHA'S VOICE / Captain?
 TASHA'S VOICE / Are you all right, sir?
 TASHA / Sir... ?
 PICARD / I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind seems to have wandered for a moment... (beat) What were you saying?
 TASHA / I was asking if you'd ever been aboard a Galaxy Class starship before, sir.
 PICARD / No. I'm, of course, very familiar with the blueprints and specifications... but this will be my first time aboard.
 TASHA / Well then, sir, if I may be so bold -- you're in for a treat. The Enterprise is quite a ship.
 PICARD / I'm sure she is.
 TASHA / Have I done something wrong, sir?
 PICARD / No. You just seem very... familiar.
 TASHA / Acknowledged, Enterprise.
 TASHA / (continuing) There she is...
 TROI / Captain?
 PICARD / Tasha... I was just with Tasha, in the shuttle...
 TROI / Troi to Doctor Crusher. Something's wrong with the Captain. We're on our way to Sickbay.
 BEVERLY / I've finished the neurographic scan. I don't see anything that might cause hallucinations or a psychogenic reaction.
 TROI / Is there any indication of temporal displacement?
 BEVERLY / No. Usually a temporal shift would leave some kind of trypamine residue in the cerebral cortex. But the scan didn't find any. (lightly) Personally, I think you just enjoy waking everyone up in the middle of the night.
 PICARD / Actually, I just like running around the ship in my bare feet.
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) Your blood gas analysis is consistent with someone who's been breathing the ship's air for weeks. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / If you'd been somewhere else, there would be some indication of a change in your oxygen isotope ratios. (to Ogawa) Thanks, Alissa.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Deanna... would you excuse us?
 TROI / Of course.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc... I scanned for any evidence of Irumodic Syndrome, as you suggested. There wasn't any. But I did detect a small structural defect in your parietal lobe.
 PICARD / A defect... that you've never noticed before?
 BEVERLY / It's the kind of thing that would only show up on a level four neurographic scan. (beat) It could leave you susceptible to several neurological disorders... including Irumodic Syndrome.
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Now, it's possible you could have that defect for the rest of your life without developing a problem... (beat) ... but even if you do... many people lead perfectly normal lives for a long time after the onset of Irumodic Syndrome.
 PICARD / (smiles wryly) Then why do you look like you've just signed my death sentence?
 BEVERLY / Sorry. (beat) I guess... this has caught me off guard.
 PICARD / Well, let's not worry about it. (beat) Something tells me you're going to have to put up with me for a very long time.
 BEVERLY / (trying to be light) It won't be easy, but I'll manage.
 They smile at each other in a friendly, intimate way. RIKER ENTERS. / 
 PICARD / (to Riker) Did Worf find anything?
 RIKER / No, sir. His security scans came up negative. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / They're checking the sensor logs... but there's still no indication that you left the ship.
 PICARD / It wasn't a dream... something did happen.
 WORF'S COM VOICE / Worf to Captain.
 PICARD / (to com) Go ahead, Lieutenant.
 WORF / Sir -- there is an incoming transmission from Admiral Nakamura. It is a priority one message.
 PICARD / Beverly?
 PICARD / (continuing, to com) Mister Worf, route it through to Doctor Crusher's office.
 PICARD / Admiral.
 PICARD / Is there any indication why they would make such a blatantly aggressive move?
 PICARD / What are our orders?
 PICARD / Am I authorized to enter the Zone?
 PICARD / Understood.
 GEORDI / Captain... what's wrong?
 PICARD / This isn't my time. I belong somewhere else...
 GEORDI / What?
 PICARD / I mean... I... I wasn't here a moment ago...
 GEORDI / What do you mean? You've been right here with me...
 PICARD / No, no... I was somewhere else... a long time ago... (beat) I was talking to someone... Beverly... Beverly was there...
 GEORDI / It's okay, Captain... everything's going to be all right.
 PICARD / (emphatic) I'm not senile. It did happen. I was here, with you... and then I was in another place... (beat) It was... it was back on the Enterprise! (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (suddenly unsure) At least, I think it was... it seemed like Sickbay... but maybe it was a hospital... or...
 GEORDI / Captain, I think we should go back to the house... call a doctor...
 PICARD / (louder) No. I know what you're thinking. It's the Irumodic Syndrome -- it's beginning to -- to affect the old man's mind. Well, it's not that. And I wasn't daydreaming, either.
 GEORDI / All right... all right... what do you want do about it?
 PICARD / I want to see Data.
 GEORDI / Data... Why?
 PICARD / I think he can help...
 GEORDI / Help -- how?
 PICARD / (angry) I don't know! I don't know, but I want to see him!
 GEORDI / Okay... we'll go see Data. Is he still at Cambridge?
 PICARD / Yes... yes... I think he's...
 PICARD / (urgent, to Geordi) Do you see them?
 GEORDI / See... who?
 PICARD / They're everywhere... laughing at me... why are they laughing?
 GEORDI / Come on, Captain... let's go see Data.
 PICARD / Yes... Data... yes...
 PICARD / I know how it sounds... but it happened. It was real. I was back on the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Tea? Earl Grey. Hot.
 PICARD / Nothing...
 PICARD / This is quite a place you have here, Data. I see they treat Professors pretty well at Cambridge...
 DATA / Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This house originally belonged to Sir Isaac Newton when he held the position. It has become the traditional residence.
 DATA / (re: Jessel) She can be trying at times. (beat, smiles) But she does make me laugh.
 GEORDI / (smiles) What is it with your hair, anyway?
 DATA / I have found that a touch of gray adds an air of... distinction.
 PICARD / Is this Earl Grey? I'd swear it was breakfast tea.
 DATA / Captain, when was the last time you saw a physician about your Irumodic Syndrome?
 PICARD / A week ago. I was prescribed peridaxon. (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (quickly) And yes, I know it's not a cure... nothing can stop the deterioration of my... my synaptic pathways... (beat) You think I'm senile... that this is all some... delusion.
 GEORDI / No one said anything like that.
 DATA / In all honesty, Captain, it's a thought that has occurred to me. (beat) However, there is nothing to disprove what you are saying, either. So it's possible something is happening to you.
 DATA / (continuing) The first thing we should do is give you a complete series of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment at the bio-metrics lab here on campus. (to Jessel) Jessel, ask Professor Rippert to take over my lecture for tomorrow and possibly for the rest of the week.
 PICARD / That's the Data I remember! I knew I could count on you!
 TASHA / (to all) Commanding officer... Enterprise... arriving.
 PICARD / (to all) To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Stardate 41148...
 PICARD / (reading) ... You are hereby requested and required to take command...
 PICARD / ... to take command of the USS Enterprise as of this date. Signed Rear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command.
 PICARD'S POV - THE CATWALK / 
 PICARD / (yells) Red Alert! All hands to Battle Stations!
 TASHA / You heard him -- move!
 PICARD (V.O.) / Personal Log: Stardate 41153.7. Recorded under security lockout Omega three-two-seven. I have decided not to inform this crew of my experiences. If it's true that I've travelled to the past, I cannot risk giving them foreknowledge of what's to come.
 PICARD / Report.
 TASHA / We've completed a full subspace scan of the ship and surrounding space. We detected no unusual readings or anomalies.
 WORF / With all due respect, sir... it would help if we knew what we were looking for.
 PICARD / Noted. (to Troi) Counselor, do you sense anything unusual aboard the Enterprise... an alien presence that doesn't belong here... perhaps operating on a level of intelligence far superior to our own?
 TROI / No, sir. I'm only aware of the crew... and the families aboard the ship.
 PICARD / Mister Worf, I want you to initiate a Level Two Security Alert on all decks until further notice.
 TASHA / Sir, with all due respect... I'm the Security Chief on this ship. Unless you're planning to make a change...
 PICARD / No... no, of course not. Security Alert Two, Lieutenant.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / (to com) On my way, Chief.
 TASHA / What kind of vessels?
 PICARD / (off PADD) It says a large spatial anomaly has appeared in the Neutral Zone... (beat) In the Devron System.
 WORF / Perhaps it is a Romulan trick -- to lure ships into the Neutral Zone as an excuse for a military strike.
 PICARD / No... no, we'll proceed to Farpoint.
 TASHA / Sir?
 PICARD / You heard me.
 WORF / But Captain -- the security of the Federation may be at stake!
 PICARD / Man your station, Mister Worf.
 TROI / Captain, perhaps if we understood your thinking, if you could explain --
 PICARD / I don't intend to explain anything... (to all) ... to anyone. We will proceed to Farpoint Station, as originally planned.
 PICARD / (continuing, to O'Brien) Now, if I'm not mistaken, Chief, we're having some problems with the warp plasma inducers.
 PICARD / I think I know a way to get them back on-line. You're with me. (to Tasha) We'll be in Main Engineering.
 WORF / (quiet, to Tasha) I do not understand. The Romulans may be planning an attack, and he does not seem to care. (beat) Are you certain this is the same man who commanded the Stargazer?
 TASHA / As far as I know.
 WORF / What are you going to do?
 TASHA / I'm going to do what I'm told.... prepare to go to Farpoint.
 PICARD / Mister O'Brien, use these specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer.
 PICARD / But the Chief Engineer isn't on board yet. (beat) Mister O'Brien... trust me. I know you can do this.
 PICARD / All those years you spent as a child... building model starship engines... were well worth it.
 PICARD / From... your Starfleet records.
 DATA'S VOICE / That would be inadvisable.
 DATA / If you attempt to ignite a petroleum product on this ship at zero-hundred hours -- it will activate the fire suppression system, which will seal off this entire compartment.
 DATA / An expression of what?
 DATA / Ah. Then "to burn the midnight oil" implies late work?
 DATA / I am curious. What is the etymology of that idiom? How did it come to be used in contemporary language?
 PICARD / Commander Data, welcome aboard -- it's good to see you.
 DATA / It is... good to see you, too, sir.
 PICARD / I could use your help with the infusor array.
 DATA / Certainly.
 PICARD / As you can see, we're having difficulty with the plasma conduits...
 DATA / (re: panel) This will require a completely new field induction subprocessor. (beat) It appears that we will be required to... ignite the midnight petroleum, sir.
 BEVERLY'S VOICE / Jean-Luc... what's going on?
 PICARD / It happened again.
 BEVERLY / A time shift?
 PICARD / Yes...
 RIKER / What happened?
 PICARD / It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time. I think the more I shift between time periods, the more memory I retain... (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (thinks) First, I was in what appeared to be the future... years from now. Then I was in the past again... right before our first mission...
 RIKER / (to Beverly) What is it?
 BEVERLY / (off tricorder) I just scanned his temporal lobe and compared it to the scan I performed just a few minutes ago. There's a thirteen percent increase of acetylcholine in his hippocampus. (to Picard) Within a matter of minutes, you accumulated over two days worth of memories.
 PICARD / (to Troi) Counselor, do you remember the first day I came aboard the Enterprise?
 TROI / Yes.
 PICARD / What happened after the welcoming ceremony?
 TROI / There was a reception in Ten Forward... I introduced you to Worf and the other senior officers...
 PICARD / Do you have any memory of me calling for a Red Alert in spacedock? Do you remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zone to investigate a spatial anomaly?
 TROI / No...
 DATA / It would appear that there is a discontinuity between the time periods you have described. Events in one time period would seem to have no effect on the other two.
 RIKER / And yet in both the past and the present -- there's a report of the same anomaly in the Devron System. It's hard to believe that's a coincidence.
 PICARD / For all I know, there may be one in the future, too.
 GEORDI / Maybe the anomaly is some kind of... temporal disruption.
 BEVERLY / (to Picard) But how is all this related to your time shifting?
 PICARD / These are good questions. And I suspect I might find some answers when I return to the past... but for now we're facing a potentially dangerous threat from the Romulans. (beat) All departments should submit combat readiness reports by oh eight hundred hours tomorrow. Dismissed.
 RIKER / (to Troi) Looks like it's going to be a late night... want to get some dinner first?
 TROI / Actually, I... (re: Worf) I mean... we have plans.
 RIKER / Oh... I see. Well then... see you tomorrow morning.
 WORF / Goodnight, sir.
 RIKER / Worf...
 PICARD / (to Data) ... and I want continuous subspace sweeps. We might detect a temporal disturbance.
 DATA / Aye sir.
 PICARD / Wil... this time shifting... when it happens, I experience a moment of disorientation. If this should happen during a crisis, I want you to be ready to take command immediately.
 PICARD / Number One?
 RIKER / Sorry, Captain. Be prepared to take command. Aye sir.
 PICARD / Speaking of disorientation... are you all right?
 RIKER / Just a little distracted. I'm fine.
 PICARD / You have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready Room.
 PICARD / Come.
 BEVERLY / (to replicator) Milk, warm -- dash of nutmeg.
 PICARD / What's this?
 BEVERLY / A prescription. A glass of warm milk and eight hours uninterrupted sleep.
 PICARD / Beverly...
 BEVERLY / Doctor's orders. You're exhausted. I don't know if you've slept in the past or the future... but I know you haven't slept in the present. (lightly) Get some rest, or I'll have you relieved and sedated.
 PICARD / (lightly) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / (continuing) What's wrong?
 PICARD / (continuing) Beverly.
 BEVERLY / As a physician, it's often my job to give people unpleasant news... to tell them that they need surgery or that they can't have children... (beat) Or that they might be facing a difficult illness...
 PICARD / You said yourself it's only a possibility.
 BEVERLY / But you've been to the future... you know it's going to happen.
 PICARD / I prefer to think of the future as something that is not written in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty-five years.
 BEVERLY / (quiet) A lot of things can happen.
 GEORDI'S VOICE / Sir? Wake up... sir?
 PICARD / Yes... yes, what is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone?
 GEORDI / The Neutral Zone?
 PICARD / Sorry... I was... in the past again... (beat) What's going on?
 GEORDI / Data's arranged for us to run some tests on you in the bio-metrics lab. We're ready to go if you are.
 PICARD / No... no, we don't have time for that. We have to get to the Neutral Zone.
 GEORDI / Why?
 PICARD / In the other two time periods... Starfleet reported a... uh... some kind of... spatial anomaly in the... in the... (beat) ... in the Devron System! The Devron System in the Neutral Zone!
 GEORDI / Sir...
 PICARD / (thinking) If the anomaly was in the past... it might be here, too. We have to go find out...
 GEORDI / Just because you've seen it in two other time frames, doesn't mean it's going to be here.
 PICARD / But if it is -- that means something! Damnit, Geordi -- I know what we have to do!
 GEORDI / Okay... but first of all, there is no Neutral Zone, remember?
 PICARD / (struggling) Right... right. Klingons... in this time period, the Klingons have taken over the Romulan Empire...
 GEORDI / And the relations between us and the Klingons aren't real cozy right now.
 PICARD / I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know.
 PICARD / (continuing) Sorry, Geordi... it's hard for me to concentrate... and remember things... I don't mean to take out that frustration on you...
 GEORDI / It's okay... (beat) Well, if we're going to the Devron System, we're going to need a ship.
 PICARD / I think it's time to call in some old favors... (beat) Contact Admiral Riker at Starbase Two-four-seven.
 RIKER / Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help... but frankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closed their borders to all Federation starships.
 PICARD / Wil... if this... spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System...
 RIKER / I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence on that sector this morning. There's no activity... there's nothing unusual happening in the Devron System.
 PICARD / I don't believe that! Maybe their long-range scanners are flawed... we have to go there, see for ourselves!
 RIKER / Data, what do you make of all this?
 DATA / I am not certain. I cannot disprove what the Captain is saying. (beat) And he is convinced he is travelling back and forth through time.
 RIKER / Right. (beat) Look, I've got the Yorktown out near the border... I'll have them run some long range scans of the Devron System... if they find anything, I'll let you know.
 PICARD / That's not good enough.
 RIKER / (firm) It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. That's all I can do. Riker out.
 DATA / (to computer) Computer -- restore holographic image.
 PICARD / (angry) Damn him anyway... after all we've been through together... he's been sitting behind that desk too long.
 GEORDI / Well... I guess all we can do is wait to see if the Yorktown finds anything.
 DATA / There is another option.
 DATA / (continuing) We could arrange passage aboard a medical ship.
 PICARD / Medical ship?
 DATA / Yes. There was an outbreak of Terrellian Plague on Romulus. The Klingons have been allowing Federation medical ships to cross the border.
 PICARD / (excited) Yes... yes...
 GEORDI / (resigned) So now all we need is a medical ship.
 PICARD / I think I can arrange that. (to Data) Find the USS Pasteur. I have some pull with the Captain. (beat, then concerned) At least, I used to...
 BEVERLY / Well... this is a page out of the past. I never thought I'd see any one of you on a starship again. (shaking hands) Data, Geordi...
 PICARD / Let's just... choose one.
 PICARD / Well. Did you get my message?
 BEVERLY / Yes. Jean-Luc... going into Klingon territory -- it's insane. (shakes her head) But I never could say no to you.
 PICARD / Ah. So that's why you married me.
 BEVERLY / Now... the first order of business is to get clearance to cross the Klingon border.
 GEORDI / What about Worf? Isn't he still on the Klingon High Council?
 DATA / I'm not sure. Information on the Klingon political structure is hard to come by these days. However, at last report Worf was governor of H'atoria, a small Klingon colony near the border.
 PICARD / Worf... yes, that's it... that's the answer. Worf. He'll help us. Let's make it so.
 PICARD / (overlapping) Yes?
 BEVERLY / (overlapping) Yes?
 BEVERLY / Tell McKinley that we've been called away on a priority mission. We won't be docking.
 PICARD / Kept the name, eh?
 BEVERLY / (smiling) I've prepared quarters for you on Deck Five if you'd like some rest.
 PICARD / I'm fine. I don't need any rest.
 BEVERLY / (to Chilton) Nell, please escort the Ambassador to his quarters--
 PICARD / I can find my way around a starship!
 PICARD / You're all treating me like an invalid, but I assure you I've got a few years left. I don't need to be led around and I don't want to be patronized.
 BEVERLY / You're right. I'm sorry.
 PICARD / I'll go have a rest.
 BEVERLY / How long since he's had a neurological scan?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure, but don't waste your time suggesting it. He says he's not taking "any more damn tests."
 BEVERLY / Do you believe he's moving through time?
 BEVERLY / (continuing) I don't know if I do, either... but -- he's Jean-Luc Picard. And if he wants to go on one more mission, that's what we're going to do.
 BEVERLY / (to Chilton) Ensign Chilton, set course for H'atoria.
 PICARD / We'll find the anomaly... I know we will...
 PICARD / Report.
 PICARD / (to Data) Is there anything unusual in the vicinity?
 DATA / How would you define unusual, sir? Every region of space has unique properties that cannot be found anywhere else.
 PICARD / There should be a... "barrier" of some sort nearby. A large plasma field... highly disruptive.
 TASHA / Nothing, sir.
 PICARD / It's the right time... right place... he should be here...
 PICARD / (calls out) Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! What sort of game are you playing?
 PICARD / (continuing, to Troi) Counselor, do you sense an alien presence?
 TROI / No, sir.
 WORF / (sotto, to Tasha) What is a... "Q"?
 TASHA / (sotto) It's a letter of the alphabet, as far as I know.
 PICARD / (quiet) This is not the way it's supposed to happen... (to all) Maintain position here. I'll be in my Ready Room.
 PICARD / Q... I thought so. What's going on?
 PICARD / The last time I stood in this courtroom was seven years ago...
 PICARD / (doggedly) You accused me of being the representative of a barbarous species...
 PICARD / But we demonstrated that mankind has become peaceful and benevolent. You agreed, and let us go on our way. (looking around) Why do I find myself back in this courtroom?
 PICARD / Are you putting mankind on trial again?
 PICARD / Is there any connection at all between the trial seven years ago... and whatever's going on now?
 PICARD / The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone -- is it related to what's happening?
 PICARD / Is it part of a Romulan plot? A ploy to start a war?
 PICARD / That's only four --
 PICARD / Did you create the anomaly?
 PICARD / (trying another tack) Are you responsible for my shifting through time?
 PICARD / Why?
 PICARD / Guilty of what?
 PICARD / We have journeyed to countless new worlds... made contact with new species... expanded man's understanding of the universe...
 PICARD / We are what we are, Q -- and we're doing the best we can. It's not for you to set the standard by which we're judged.
 PICARD / (tight) Having rendered a verdict... have you decided upon a sentence?
 PICARD / We're to be denied travel through space?
 PICARD / Q... even you could not be capable of such an act --
 PICARD / Me...
 PICARD / What sort of meaningless doubletalk is that?
 PICARD / (to com) Commander, assemble the Senior Staff and go to Red Alert. (beat) We have a bigger problem than we thought.
 GEORDI / I don't believe him. This has to be another one of Q's games. He's probably listening to us right now, getting a big laugh out of watching us jump through his hoops.
 PICARD / I think that this time, we have no choice but to take him at his word... which means that in some fashion, I will cause the destruction of humanity.
 BEVERLY / But didn't Q say you already had caused it?
 TROI / And that you were causing it now...
 DATA / Given the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity between the three time periods the Captain is visiting, Q's statement may be accurate, if confusing.
 PICARD / So what should I do -- just lock myself in a room in all three time periods?
 RIKER / No. Maybe not acting is what causes the destruction of mankind. What if you were needed on the Bridge at a key moment, and weren't there?
 TROI / We can't start second-guessing ourselves. I think we have to proceed normally... deal with each situation as it occurs...
 PICARD / Agreed. (beat) I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. He admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time...
 PICARD / (continuing) It occurred to me... that perhaps Q is giving me a chance to save mankind somehow.
 RIKER / What makes you say that?
 PICARD / Q has always shown a certain... fascination with humanity... and specifically with me. I think he has more than a casual interest in what happens to me.
 DATA / That is true. Q's interest in you is very similar to that of a master and a beloved pet.
 DATA / (continuing) That was only an analogy, Captain.
 PICARD / If I weren't traveling through time... I would never have realized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in the past as well. (beat) Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, my ability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what's going on.
 PICARD / Go ahead.
 PICARD / On our way.
 PICARD / All stop. Initiate a long range scan.
 DATA / (working) There are four Warbirds holding position on the Romulan side of the Neutral Zone, Captain.
 WORF / The Federation Starships Concord and Bozeman are holding position on our side.
 RIKER / Face-off. The question is, who's going to move first?
 PICARD / We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship.
 WORF / The Warbird Terix is responding.
 PICARD / On screen.
 WORF / Captain Picard.
 BEVERLY / (to Worf) Hello, Worf. It's been a long time.
 WORF / Doctor... it is good to see you again.
 BEVERLY / Did you have a chance to read our request?
 WORF / Yes. But you must realize... I am no longer a member of the High Council.
 BEVERLY / You are the Governor of the H'atoria Colony.
 WORF / (with contempt) It is merely a ceremonial position given me when the house of Mogh was forced from power.
 PICARD / Worf, surely you still have some influence. We must get into the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Can't you at least grant us permission to cross the border?
 WORF / I must refuse. It is for your own safety -- the Neutral Zone is extremely volatile. (beat) If Admiral Riker had given you a starship with a cloak, you would have been safe. I cannot believe he refused to help you.
 PICARD / I don't care what kind of ship we're in -- the important thing is to get to the Devron System --
 WORF / I am sorry, but my first duty is to the Empire. I must adhere to regulations.
 PICARD / Maybe I'm just an old man who doesn't understand... but the Worf I knew cared more about things like loyalty and honor than he did rules and regulations. (beat) But then, that was a long time ago. Maybe you're not the Worf I knew.
 WORF / (a curse) Dor-sHo GHA!
 WORF / (continuing) You have always used your knowledge of Klingon honor and tradition to get what you want from me.
 PICARD / (right back at him) That's because it always works. Your problem, Worf, is that you really do have a sense of honor... you really do care about things like loyalty and trust. Don't blame me because I know you too well.
 WORF / Very well. You may cross the border. But only if I come with you. I am familiar with the Neutral Zone.
 PICARD / Terms accepted.
 BEVERLY / (to Chilton) Inform Transporter Room Two to beam the Governor aboard.
 BEVERLY / I just want to make one thing clear, Jean-Luc. If we run into any serious opposition, I'm taking us back to Federation territory. We aren't well armed and we wouldn't last long in a fight.
 BEVERLY / All right. Ensign, set course for the Devron System. Warp thirteen.
 BEVERLY / Once more, for old time's sake?
 PICARD / Engage.
 PICARD / Set course for the Devron System, and engage at warp nine.
 TASHA / The Devron System is inside the Neutral Zone, sir.
 PICARD / I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief.
 TROI / (quiet, to Picard) Captain... may I have a word with you in private?
 PICARD / Of course. (to Tasha) Lieutenant, contact Farpoint Station. I want to talk to Commander Riker.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 TROI / Captain, I just want to voice my concerns about the way the crew is responding to your... unexpected orders.
 PICARD / They don't trust me... they think I'm behaving erratically.
 TROI / Some do... others are confused... it takes some time for a new crew to get to know their Captain, and for him to know them.
 PICARD / I understand that. But I know what this crew is capable of, even if they don't.
 TROI / I'm happy to hear you say that. It may do them good to hear it, as well... (beat) It would also help if they knew what was going on.
 PICARD / I know it's difficult operating in the dark, Counselor. But for now, I think it's the only choice.
 TROI / Perhaps if you could at least indicate why --
 TASHA'S COM VOICE / Yar to Captain Picard. I have Commander Riker for you, sir.
 PICARD / Put him through in here.
 PICARD / Commander. I just wanted to let you know we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station.
 RIKER'S COM VOICE / I see. May I ask how long?
 PICARD / I'm not sure. I'll keep you updated. Please inform Doctor Crusher and Lieutenant La Forge of our delay.
 PICARD / Is there anything else, Counselor?
 TROI / Actually... there is, sir. I've been debating whether or not to mention it... but perhaps... (becomes more resolute) It's about Commander Riker.
 PICARD / What about him?
 TROI / Well... I think you should know that we... have had a prior relationship.
 PICARD / I see. Do you anticipate this interfering with your duties?
 TROI / No, sir. It was several years ago. And it's well behind us both. But I thought you should know...
 PICARD / I appreciate your telling me... but I'm sure the two of you will find a way to... deal with the situation.
 PICARD / (continuing) Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.
 PICARD / There is another alternative, Tomolak. We're both here for the same reason. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate the anomaly in the Devron System.
 PICARD / No.
 PICARD / You needn't make threats. I think we're all aware of the consequences.
 PICARD / (to Conn Officer) Set course for the Devron system. Warp five. Engage.
 DATA / Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead.
 PICARD / All stop. On screen.
 PICARD / (to Data) Full scan, Mister Data.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / We are approaching the Devron system, Captain. Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead.
 PICARD / All stop. Put it onscreen.
 PICARD / (continuing, to himself) It's bigger in the past...
 TROI / Sir?
 PICARD / Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / On screen! On screen! Let's see it!
 DATA / As you can see, sir -- there's nothing there.
 DATA / Still nothing, Captain. I've conducted a full sensor sweep out to one light year from the Pasteur. No temporal anomalies, no particle fluctuations... nothing.
 PICARD / Have you scanned the entire subspace bandwidth?
 GEORDI / Yes. The subspace barrier is a little thin in this region of space, but that's not unusual.
 PICARD / I don't understand. I've already seen it in the other two -- the other two time periods. Why isn't it here?
 WORF / (to Beverly) Captain. I have been monitoring Klingon communication channels... several warships have been dispatched to this sector to search for a... renegade Federation vessel.
 PICARD / You're not thinking about leaving?
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, there's nothing here...
 PICARD / There should be -- there has to be! (MORE)
 PICARD (Cont'd) / (to Data) Data, there must be some other way to scan for temporal disturbances... something that's not covered in a normal sensor sweep.
 DATA / There are several methods of detecting temporal disturbances, but we're limited by the equipment on the Pasteur. This ship is designed primarily for medical emergencies.
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, we've done all we can... we should head back to Federation territory.
 DATA / (still thinking) However, it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse, which could scan beyond the subspace barrier.
 PICARD / Very good! Make it so!
 BEVERLY / Wait a minute... Data, how long would this take?
 DATA / To make the modifications and search the entire Devron System will take approximately fourteen hours.
 BEVERLY / All right. Data, begin modifying the tachyon pulse. Ensign Chilton, lay in a course back to the Federation. If we haven't found anything in six hours, we're heading back at maximum warp.
 PICARD / Six hours may not be enough. We have to stay here until we find it -- no matter how long it takes!
 BEVERLY / (to Chilton) Carry out my orders. (to Picard) May I see you for a moment?
 PICARD / Beverly, I can't believe you're not willing to stay here until --
 BEVERLY / Don't you ever question my orders on the Bridge of my ship again!
 PICARD / I'm just trying to... there are larger concerns here... don't you understand that --
 BEVERLY / I understand that you would never have tolerated that kind of behavior back on the Enterprise -- and I won't here. I don't care if you're my ex-Captain or my ex-husband.
 PICARD / You're right... I was out of line... it won't happen again... (beat) But, you have to understand... the stakes here are enormous. Q has said all of humanity will be destroyed...
 BEVERLY / I know. And that's why I'm willing to stay here a while longer and keep looking. (beat) But I also want you to consider the possibility that none of what you're saying is real.
 PICARD / What... ?
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, I care for you too much not to tell you the truth. You have advanced Irumodic Syndrome. I have to consider the possibility that all of this is in your mind. (beat) I'll stay here six hours... and then we're heading home.
 BEVERLY / And I want you to remember, if it were anyone but you... we wouldn't be here at all.
 PICARD / Q... what's going on here? Where's the anomaly?
 PICARD / Stop this foolishness and answer me!
 PICARD / What help?
 PICARD / My time shifting... the answer does lie there... (beat) Just tell me one thing... this anomaly we're looking for... is that what destroys humanity?
 PICARD / By doing what? When? How are you --
 PICARD / (to Data) Report, Mister Data.
 DATA / (off console) The anomaly is two hundred million kilometers in diameter. It is a highly focused temporal energy source which is emitting approximately the same energy output as ten G-type stars.
 PICARD / What is the source of that energy?
 DATA / I am uncertain. Sensors have been unable to penetrate the anomaly.
 PICARD / What if we modified the main deflector to emit an... inverse tachyon pulse. That might scan beyond the subspace barrier... give us an idea what the interior of this thing looks like.
 DATA / That is a most intriguing idea, Captain. I do not believe a tachyon beam was ever put to such use. I had no idea you were so versed in the intricacies of temporal theory.
 PICARD / I have some friends who are quite well versed in the matter. Make it so.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 DATA / I believe we can make the necessary modifications in Main Engineering.
 GEORDI / We can get more power if we reroute the primary EPS taps to the deflector array...
 DATA / Agreed.
 DATA / Initiating tachyon pulse...
 GEORDI / Okay... the pulse is holding steady... we're starting to receive data from the scan...
 DATA / It will take the computer some time to give us a complete picture of the anomaly's interior. I suggest we --
 GEORDI / (in pain) Whoa...
 DATA / What is wrong?
 GEORDI / I'm not sure... oh... it's like somebody put an ice pick through my temples... (beat) My VISOR's picking up all kinds of electromagnetic distortions.
 DATA / (to com) Data to Sickbay. Medical emergency in Main Engineering.
 BEVERLY / Look at his eyes... you can see the difference yourself.
 PICARD / (peering) Yes... I can see the iris...
 BEVERLY / (off scanner) This is amazing. The DNA in his optic nerves is being regenerated...
 BEVERLY / It's as if he were growing new eyes.
 GEORDI / I guess that's why I started to feel pain... my optical cortex was falling out of alignment with my VISOR.
 PICARD / How is this possible?
 BEVERLY / It shouldn't be possible at all. There's no medical explanation for the spontaneous regeneration of an organ.
 DATA / I believe I may have a partial explanation, Captain.
 DATA / (continuing) I have completed my analysis of the anomaly. It appears to be a multi-phasic temporal convergence in the space-time continuum.
 BEVERLY / In English please.
 DATA / It is, in essence, an eruption of... anti-time.
 PICARD / Anti-time?
 DATA / A relatively new concept in temporal mechanics. The relationship of anti-time to normal time is analogous to the relationship of anti-matter to normal matter.
 PICARD / (catching on) So if time and anti-time were to collide...
 DATA / They would annihilate each other... creating a rupture in space. I believe this is what has happened in the Devron System. (MORE)
 DATA / (continuing) The rupture may be sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal flow of time.
 BEVERLY / Then it's possible the DNA molecules in Geordi's optic nerves aren't regenerating themselves... They might be reverting to their original state.
 PICARD / You mean his eyes are getting... younger?
 DATA / For all intents and purposes, yes.
 PICARD / So the temporal anomaly has certain... rejuvenating effects. It certainly doesn't sound like the destruction of humanity. (beat) Data, what could have caused this collision between time and anti-time?
 DATA / Anti-time, sir?
 PICARD / (to Data) I believe that if we modify the deflector to send out an inverse tachyon pulse, you'll find that the anomaly is a rupture between time and anti-time.
 DATA / That is a fascinating hypothesis... how did you formulate --
 PICARD / It would take too long to explain. Begin the modifications and send out the pulse. Once you've done that, start working on a theory as to what could have caused this rupture.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Mister O'Brien... how big is the anomaly?
 PICARD / I still don't understand why it's larger here...
 WORF / Captain... there are five Terrellian transport ships holding position in the Devron system.
 TASHA / We're being hailed by the lead ship.
 PICARD / On screen.
 PICARD / Why have you come here?
 PICARD / We can't really be certain that the... Light... has this power. And there may be dangers, side effects we're not aware of...
 PICARD / It would be safer for all concerned if you left the Neutral Zone... and let us investigate the phenomenon more fully.
 PICARD / I warn you that if the Romulans should decide to intervene, I may not be able to protect you.
 PICARD / (to Tasha) You have the Bridge, Lieutenant. I'll be in my Ready Room.
 TASHA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / What's going on?
 BEVERLY / We're under attack.
 WORF / Two Klingon attack cruisers have decloaked to port and starboard.
 BEVERLY / (to Chilton) Warp speed -- get us out of here!
 BEVERLY / (to Chilton) Heading one-four-eight, mark two-one-five. Full impulse.
 PICARD / (to Worf) Weapons status?
 WORF / These phasers are no match for their shields.
 BEVERLY / Geordi, we need warp power -- now.
 GEORDI / Sorry, Captain, they're just too much for us. I can't keep the phase inducers on-line --
 BEVERLY / Open a channel. (beat) This is Captain Beverly Picard. We're a medical ship on a mission of mercy! Break off your --
 BEVERLY / (continuing) Worf, signal our surrender.
 WORF / (to com) Tos Vah'cha Worf, do'lo jegh! (This is Governor Worf, we surrender!)
 WORF / (off his console) Our shields have collapsed. We're defenseless.
 DATA / (off console) Captain, there's another ship de-cloaking -- bearing two-one-five mark three-one-oh... (beat) It's the Enterprise!
 DATA / They're hailing us.
 RIKER / I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by while I try to get the Klingons' attention...
 WORF / The Enterprise is drawing their fire.
 BEVERLY / Damage report.
 GEORDI / Our warp core's badly damaged... there's a breach in progress.
 PICARD / Warp core breach... that may be it. We have to stop it!
 DATA / The Klingon ship is disengaging. (beat) Admiral Riker is hailing us.
 RIKER / Our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach in progress. Prepare for emergency beam-out.
 RIKER / Raise shields. Where are the Klingons?
 RIKER / They'll be back...
 RIKER / (to Picard) As I said -- I figured you weren't going to take no for answer. (MORE)
 RIKER (Cont'd) / (then to Worf) But I thought you would have more sense. I can't believe you let a defenseless ship cross into hostile territory without an escort.
 WORF / If you had not turned down the Captain when he came to you for help, none of this would have happened. Unlike you, I still have a sense of loyalty and honor...
 PICARD / We don't have time for this. The Pasteur's core is going to breach.
 RIKER / (to Conn Officer) Move us away. Full impulse.
 RIKER / All right. Let's get out of here.
 PICARD / No... we can't... we have to save humanity...
 RIKER / (to Gaines) Engage cloak.
 RIKER / We'll have to do this the old-fashioned way. Lay in a course back to the Federation. Warp thirteen.
 PICARD / (to Riker) Wil, don't leave! We have to stay here -- find the cause of the temporal anomaly...
 RIKER / Captain, we can't stay...
 PICARD / We have to! Everything depends on this! We can't leave now -- please listen to me!
 Beverly moves up behind him and applies the hypospray. And as Picard collapses into Riker's arms, the SCENE CHANGES TO: / 
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc. (to Ogawa) I'll be right back, Alissa.
 BEVERLY / (sotto) Alissa lost the baby.
 BEVERLY / I think it's the same thing that happened to Geordi. Somehow, the temporal energy from the anomaly caused the fetal tissue to revert to an earlier stage of development. It was as if the unborn child began to... grow younger... until finally the DNA itself began to break down.
 PICARD / How is she?
 BEVERLY / Physically, she's fine. For now. But if this temporal reversion continues, I don't think any of us are going to be fine for much longer.
 PICARD / So this is affecting the entire crew...
 BEVERLY / (nods) Our cellular structures appear to be coalescing... reverting to earlier structures. (MORE)
 BEVERLY (Cont'd) / In some cases, this has caused old injuries to be healed... but that's only a temporary effect. Eventually, this could kill us all.
 PICARD / We also have to find out how widespread this effect is. (to Troi) Send an inquiry to Starbase Twenty-three -- they're the nearest outpost -- have them begin checking their personnel for any signs of temporal reversion.
 TROI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data, how long until we've completed the tachyon scan?
 DATA / Approximately one hour, forty-five minutes.
 PICARD / Good. Once it's completed, I want you to find a way to dissipate the anomaly without making things worse. Give me a risk analysis on whatever solution you come up with.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Dismissed.
 PICARD / Why? Will that cause the destruction of mankind?
 PICARD / Home?
 PICARD / Is there a point to all this?
 PICARD / The anomaly is here, at Earth... ?
 PICARD / The further back in time... the larger the anomaly.
 PICARD / You mean I caused the anomaly... and the anomaly... in some way... disrupted the beginning of life on Earth.
 TROI / Captain, I've just spoken to Doctor Selar... she said that twenty-three children on board have contracted some kind of illness. Their tissues appear to be... reverting to an earlier stage of development. (beat) She thinks it has something to do with the anomaly.
 PICARD / Inform Starfleet Command that we believe the anomaly has toxic effects. Tell them I'm ordering the Terrellian ships back to Federation territory, but that we're staying here.
 TASHA / We are?
 PICARD / Yes. We have to find a way to collapse this anomaly. (to Troi) Counselor, prepare to evacuate all civilians and non-essential personnel to the Terrellians ships.
 TROI / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Data, O'Brien, you're with me.
 PICARD / Let's concentrate on how this anomaly was initially formed. Speculation?
 DATA / Temporal ruptures in the spacetime continuum are rarely a naturally occurring phenomenon. It is therefore most likely that this anomaly was caused by an outside catalyst.
 PICARD / I think I can rule out a warp core explosion.
 DATA / Our tachyon pulse has been unable to penetrate the anomaly completely. If we had information about the center of the phenomenon, we might have a basis for speculation.
 PICARD / Can you find a way to scan the interior?
 PICARD / Do you know what could?
 DATA / In theory, a tomographic imaging scanner capable of multiphasic resolution would be able to penetrate this much interference. (beat) The Daystrom Institute has been working on such a device, but it is still only theoretical.
 PICARD / Data... do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board?
 DATA / Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly?
 DATA / Possibly.
 DATA / (continuing, off console) There is a great deal of interference... but I am getting some readings. (beat) This is very unusual...
 PICARD / What is it?
 DATA / It appears that our tachyon pulse is converging with two other tachyon pulses at the center of the anomaly. The other two pulses have the exact same amplitude modulation as our own pulse. It is as if all three originated from the Enterprise.
 PICARD / Three pulses... from three time periods... all converging at one point in space.
 DATA / Captain, what are you suggesting?
 PICARD / Computer, where's Admiral Riker?
 GEORDI / The ship has held up pretty well over the years.
 RIKER / They were going to decommission her about five years ago... but one nice thing about being an Admiral is getting to choose your own ship.
 BEVERLY / (to Riker) Wil... how long is this thing between you and Worf going to go on?
 RIKER / It's been going on for twenty years now... doesn't look like it's going to end any time soon.
 DATA / I suspect the last thing Counselor Troi would have wanted is for the two of you to be alienated.
 BEVERLY / I agree. It's time to put this behind you.
 RIKER / I tried -- at Deanna's funeral. He wouldn't talk to me.
 GEORDI / Might have been tough for him then... he took her death pretty hard.
 RIKER / Yeah, well... he wasn't the only one.
 BEVERLY / I know. But in his mind... you were the reason he and Deanna never got together.
 RIKER / I didn't do anything to stand in his way --
 BEVERLY / (beat) Didn't you, Wil?
 RIKER / Did I?
 RIKER / (continuing) I just... never could admit it was over. I kept thinking one day we'd get together again... and then... she was gone. (beat) You think you've got all the time in the world, until...
 RIKER / Yeah.
 PICARD / Ensign. How... do I get to Ten Forward?
 PICARD / Thank you.
 BEVERLY / Oh, my god.
 PICARD / Wil! I know what's happening... I know what causes the anomaly... we have to go back!
 RIKER / Jean-Luc... the only place you're going back to is bed.
 PICARD / Damnit Wil, I know what's happening. We're causing the anomaly... with a... with the tachyon pulse... it happened in all three time periods. We do it in all three time periods!
 BEVERLY / Jean-Luc, you better come with me.
 PICARD / Leave me alone! I'm not crazy. The tachyon pulses... they -- they were used in the same spot -- in all three time periods... don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used the -- I mean, when the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, we set the -- you know -- we... started everything... we set it in motion.
 PICARD / It's like... the chicken and the egg! You think it started back then... but it didn't... it started here in the future... that's why it gets larger in the past...
 DATA / I think I understand what the Captain is saying. If I'm not mistaken, he is describing a paradox.
 PICARD / Yes! Yes, exactly!
 DATA / Intriguing... it is possible we could've created the very anomaly we have been looking for.
 DATA / Let us assume for the moment, that the Captain has indeed been travelling through time. Let us also assume he has initiated an inverse tachyon pulse at the same coordinates in space in all three time periods. (beat) In that case, it is possible that the convergence of three tachyon pulses could've ruptured the subspace barrier and caused an anti-time reaction.
 GEORDI / I see where you're going. And because anti-time operates in the opposite way normal time does, the effects would run backwards through the spacetime continuum.
 PICARD / Yes! That's why the anomaly was larger in the past. It was growing as it travelled backward through time.
 RIKER / All right... let's say for the moment, you're right. What do we do about it?
 PICARD / Go back. Go back to the Devron System.
 DATA / He may be right. If we return to the Devron System now, we might see the initial formation of the anomaly.
 RIKER / Riker to Bridge. Set course for the Devron System. Maximum warp.
 RIKER / Worf... we could use a hand.
 RIKER / All stop.
 DATA / (off console) Sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow.
 RIKER / On screen.
 PICARD / I was right...
 GEORDI / (off console) It's an anti-time eruption. It seems to have formed in the last six hours.
 PICARD / We've got to stop it here... so it won't be able to travel back through time...
 RIKER / All right, Data -- we need a solution and we need it fast.
 DATA / (off console) The anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulses from the other two time periods. I suggest they be shut down.
 PICARD / (serious) The next time I'm there, that's the first thing I'll do.
 RIKER / Isn't there more we can do here... seal the rupture somehow?
 DATA / (still working) I am investigating the options.
 PICARD / (quickly) Data, disengage the tachyon pulse.
 DATA / Sir?
 PICARD / Just do it. The convergence of tachyon pulses from the three time periods is what causes the anomaly.
 DATA / Aye, sir.
 PICARD / Report. Is there any change in the anomaly?
 DATA / No, sir.
 PICARD / Disengage the tachyon pulse.
 PICARD / I know that. But it's imperative that you disengage it immediately.
 DATA / (works) Aye, sir. Disengaging.
 PICARD / Why isn't the anomaly affected?
 PICARD / (to all) I've shut off the tachyon pulses in the other time periods -- but the anomaly didn't change.
 DATA / (off console) It remains unaffected here as well.
 BEVERLY / What do we do?
 GEORDI / The only way to stop this thing is to repair the rupture at the focal point where time and anti-time are converging.
 RIKER / How do we do that?
 DATA / It would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself. Once inside, we may be able to use our engines to create a static warp shell.
 GEORDI / (onto the idea) Yeah, yeah... and the shell would act like an artificial subspace barrier -- separating time and anti-time...
 DATA / Collapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time. (turns to Picard) But this would have to be done in the other two time periods, as well.
 PICARD / That could be a problem... the anomaly's so much larger in the other time periods...
 PICARD / (continuing) ... It could be dangerous to take the ship in.
 PICARD / Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course to the exact center. Transfer all available power to the shields.
 TASHA / Sir... can you give us some explanation?
 PICARD / No. I cannot.
 TASHA / Captain, so far we've obeyed every order -- no matter how far-fetched it might have seemed. But if we're to risk the safety of the ship and crew... I think we have to ask you for an explanation.
 PICARD / (continuing) I know all of you have doubts about me... about each other... about the ship. All I can say is that even though we've only been together for a short time... I know that you are the finest crew in the fleet... and I would trust each of you with my life. (beat) I'm asking you to make a leap of faith -- and trust me.
 TASHA / Shields up, maximum strength.
 WORF / Boosting field integrity on the warp nacelles. We may encounter shearing forces once we enter the anomaly.
 DATA / I am preparing to initiate a static warp shell.
 TROI / (off armchair console) All decks report ready, Captain.
 PICARD / Chief... take us in.
 DATA / Captain, I have an idea. If we take the ship to the center of the anomaly and create a static warp shell...
 PICARD / (overlapping) ... a static warp shell, it could repair the barrier and collapse the anomaly.
 DATA / (surprised) Yes, sir.
 PICARD / Mister Data, you're a clever man -- in any time period.
 PICARD / (continuing) Lay in a course to the center of the anomaly. Prepare to initiate a static warp shell.
 PICARD / The other two Enterprises... they're on their way.
 RIKER / Very well. (to con) Ensign... take us in.
 PICARD / All hands brace for impact!
 TASHA / The temporal energy's interfering with main power. Switching to...
 GEORDI / ... auxiliary power. I'm having trouble keeping the impulse engines on-line! I've got power fluctuations all across the board!
 PICARD / Maintain course and speed! (to Data) Mister Data, how long until we reach the center?
 DATA / Another thirty seconds at least, Captain.
 DATA / We have reached the center, sir.
 PICARD / Initiate warp shell!
 DATA / (working) Initiating static warp shell -- now.
 RIKER / Is it having any effect?
 DATA / (off console) Something is happening... A new subspace barrier appears to be forming --
 TASHA / (urgent) Captain! Sensors are picking up... two other ships...
 DATA / Captain, It appears to be working. The anomaly is beginning to collapse. I think that --
 TASHA / (suddenly) Sir -- the temporal energy is rupturing our warp containment system!
 WORF / We must eject the core!
 PICARD / No. We have to maintain the static warp shell for as long as possible!
 TASHA / We're losing containment! I can't stop it, it's going to --
 PICARD / (quickly, to Geordi) Transfer emergency power to the anti-matter containment system!
 GEORDI / (working frantically) I'm trying, sir... but there's a lot of interference...
 DATA / (off console) The warp shell is definitely having an effect, sir. The anomaly is collapsing --
 GEORDI / The containment system's going -- I can't hold it --
 PICARD / Maintain position! Mister La Forge --
 DATA / Both of the other ships have been destroyed.
 PICARD / (to Data) Data, report!
 DATA / The anomaly is nearly collapsed...
 GEORDI / We're losing containment...
 GEORDI / Containment field at critical! I'm losing it --
 PICARD / Are you saying it worked? We collapsed the anomaly?
 PICARD / Q, did it work?
 PICARD / What about my crew?
 PICARD / Thank you.
 PICARD / You had a hand in helping me get out of this.
 PICARD / I sincerely hope this is the last time I'll find myself here.
 PICARD / When I realized the paradox...
 PICARD / What are you trying to tell me, Q?
 TROI / Captain, are you all right?
 PICARD / Worf... what's the date?
 WORF / Stardate 47988.
 TROI / Is something wrong, sir?
 PICARD / No, no... in fact, I think I'll go back to bed. I could use some sleep.
 PICARD (V.O.) / Captain's Log, supplemental. Starfleet Command reports no unusual activity along the Neutral Zone, and there is no sign of a temporal anomaly. It would appear that I am the only member of the crew to retain any knowledge of the events I experienced.
 BEVERLY / That's it for me.
 TROI / There's always next time.
 GEORDI / That's four hands in a row. How does he do it?
 RIKER / I cheat.
 RIKER / (continuing) I'm kidding.
 BEVERLY / I've been thinking... about all the things the Captain told us about the future. The way we changed and drifted apart... why would he tell us what's to come?
 GEORDI / It sure goes against everything we've heard about not polluting the time line...
 DATA / I believe, however, that this situation is unique.
 DATA / (continuing) Since the temporal anomaly did not occur, there have already been changes in the way this time line is unfolding. The future we experience will undoubtedly be different from the one the Captain encountered.
 RIKER / Maybe that's why he told us. Knowing what that future could bring... gives us a chance to change things now.
 RIKER / (continuing) So that some things never happen.
 RIKER / Come in.
 TROI / Am I too late?
 RIKER / Not at all. Have a seat.
 TROI / What's the game?
 DATA / Five card draw, deuces wild.
 RIKER / Come.
 RIKER / (continuing) Captain. Is there a problem?
 PICARD / No. I just thought I might... join you this evening. If there's room...
 RIKER / Of course.
 DATA / Would you care to deal?
 PICARD / Oh... thank you.
 PICARD / (continuing) I should have done this a long time ago. I was quite a card player in my youth, you know.
 TROI / You were always welcome.
 PICARD / So. Five card stud, nothing wild. The sky's the limit.
